Looking for Sympho threads is the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning.</br>  <br>Can't wait for who will give us the jam this time.</br>  <br>Genjuuro</br>  <br>I feel sorry for Tsubasa since she seems to be the only one that's flat. Everyone else have cowtits.<br>Even Shirabe's grew out a little bit more.</br></br>  <br><br>Genjuuro symphogear when</br></br>  <br>She doesn't have an ass either.<br>She probably has a nice toned tummy, if you're into that sort of thing.</br></br>  <br>hell yeah motherfucker</br>  <br>He doesn't need one.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but can you imagine him with one while singing the whole time?<br><br>I'm not gay and I don't like men but my dick would be erect</br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ. How does he just gently grasping the metal pole crush the damn thing?<br>Even Superman can do that shit.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know what you mean.<br>I was semi-chub during the G training montage to be honest.<br><br><br>He's the hero we need.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She isn't flat, they're just small.</br>  <br>Always did wonder what was the point of the gear users when Genjuuro probably could have done most of their work.<br>If Genjuuro was also singing with Zwei Wing, I doubt Kanade would have died.</br></br>  We've had land battles (S1), naval warfare (S2), and the trailer hints what we all know must come next: Aerospace.<br><br>Are we gonna get Zenmetsu Hibiki? Will there be another Gungnir Datto?! Is NotCommie going to throw away two seasons of convention and translate Swan Song as Superb Song? Will Miku and Hibiki finally get married? Is Ver going to redeem himself and become a True Action Hero?<br><br>Will Tsubasa ever graduate highschool?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Will Tsubasa ever graduate highschool? <br>Already confirmed. She's off being an idol with Maria while DMJii go to school.</br></br>  <br>He can't do shit against noise, since he's human.<br>Not directly, anyway.</br></br>  <br> Genjuuro probably could have done most of their work. <br>You need a Gear to not get exploded on contact by Noise. You're correct for every non-Noise opponent though.</br></br>  <br>I was talking about him taking the singing parts. Genjuuro singing Orbital Beat with the other two would be great.</br>  <br>sometimes she has a big ass,sometimes she hasn't, It's really weird</br>  <br>i still think their backup plan was quite literally people tying complete relics around his hands and feet and using them so he can strike at the noise with his martial arts bullshit.</br>  <br>Now I won't be satisfied until I see that.</br>  <br>Commie won't do it.</br>  Is someone subbing it this time?  <br>Where was this?</br>  So wait, the new characters are a bunch of androids, a literal wizard and her pet loli?<br><br>I-Is this season going to be Symphogeah vs Vocaloid?</br></br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05232 these guys are</wbr></br>  <br> I-Is this season going to be Symphogeah vs Vocaloid? <br>HYYYYYYYYYYYPE!</br></br>  <br>BASED</br>  <br> We don't translate native concepts such as mythology, foods, or customs unique to the language/country (unless it has an !

Isn't it dedicated to her by default?</br>  <br>Symphogear threads are automatically dedicated to her.<br>Mostly because there's Nanafags here no matter what time you ask. There's also that hardcore guy that tells stories of Nana.</br></br>  <br>Is it 7' o clock already?</br>  <br>First day of the 7th month.</br>  <br> tfw its already the seventh month of the year <br>Its Nana's month!</br></br>  <br>This month is official nana month!</br>  <br> its also the month where GX starts airing <br>I bet they planned this.</br></br>  <br> 2015 is over halfway finished already <br>fuck</br></br>  <br>Time really flies fast.<br>It'll only be a matter of time until Nana reaches 40.</br></br>  <br> tfw Smile Gang is also near its 700th episode <br>What a nice month.</br></br>  <br>She's forever 17.</br>  <br>She's not Yukarin, Nana is aware of her age.<br>She even joked about her age being 17x2 on her 34th birthday.</br></br>  Can we talk about Symphogear please, not about same song mcmolested as a child?  <br>u wot m8</br>   thread became Nana praising thread again <br>I really wonder why we haven't put "Nana thread" in the subject yet.</br>  <br>not wanting to worship Nana</br>    <br><br>/jp/ exists for this.</br></br>  <br> same song not mcmolested as a child <br>Look at this faggot who hasn't even tried to listen to Nana's music asides Synchrogazer and Vitalization.<br>Try to listen to her first albums before trying to judge her, fag.</br></br></br>  <br>So, asides Symphogear openings and insert songs, what other songs of Nana have you listened to, Mr. Expert?</br>  <br> complains about people talking about Nana on a Symphogear thread <br> thinks seiyuu talk goes on /jp/ <br>Be more subtle with those baits.</br></br></br>   idolfags <br><br><br>To be fair, she's more of an idol than a seiyuu.</br></br></br>  <br>Moot point, even idol seiyuu are discussed here and not on /jp/.</br>  <br>Well they should take it to the seiyuu threads then and not derail Symphogear threads all the time.</br>  <br>She's a damn Seiyuu-Artist. She calls herself a Seiyuu-Artist, everyone calls her a Seiyuu-Artist. Even Music Japan calls her a Seiyuu-Artist. No because she sings and dance in lives doesn't mean she's automatically an idol, you dumb fuck.</br>  <br>And we should take the yuri talk to /u/?<br>The Chris imagedumps to /c/?<br>Whether you like it or not, that's not how /a/ as a board works, Anon.</br></br></br>  <br>The show hasn't even aired yet, dumbass. Go bitch somewhere else.</br>  <br>I'd love if that'd happen.</br>  <br>How can you expect multi-track drifting if the train doesn't derail in the first place?</br>  <br>Well how about not having running generals then?<br><br>Second season was plagued by uneaded threads when episodes were not out.</br></br></br>  <br>Just ignore it? Or are you upset because whatever shit thread you tried to make got archived with 0 replies? If that's not the case there's no way this affects you. While we can't discuss episodes of S3 we can discuss things related to the show, which includes voice actors.</br>  <br>No no, you have it all wrong. I love Symphogear.<br><br>It's just that there is nothing to discuss yet so it's just a petty circlejerk with no real meaning.<br><br>I mean hype treads are alright but having multiple threads daily and even having those dreaded "edition" threads just takes away all the fun in hyping an anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just let them be if they want to discuss Nana. Hate it or not, Nana is related to Symphogear and its inevitable that someone will bring her name on these threads at times, that is one of the ordinary things in these threads, if they want to discuss her let them be, once GX airs we'll go back to Symphogear with minimum amount of Nanaposting anyway. <br>Also, stop saying things like Nana is a piece of shit, if she doesn't exist and advertise this show, this show wouldn't have existed at all. If you love Symphogear, learn to respect Nana.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear is more than just Nana anon.</br>  <br>Good thing we don't discuss only seiyuu in these or the /m/ threads then.</br>  For sake of appeasing anon, has there been any new info or comments from the pre-screening besides plot spoilers and  Chris-chan cute ?<br>Anything on Aoi/Nana's blogs, twitter/etc about the show?</br>  <br>Yes, but she's one of the major factors why this show sells.<br>She is one of King Records' top seller, and she's literally at the top of the voice acting industry today. No matter how hard you push Aoi Yuuki, she doesn't have the same popularity as Nana's even if you combine Takagaki Ayahi's fans too. I'm not biased, I'm stating this with references surveys about favorite VAs.<br>So basically my point is, yes, its more than Nana, but let's be honest, if we replace the cast with literally who's this show wouldn't have sold at all.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't have cared if she were in it or not, sales don't mean shit to me. I just enjoy it.</br>  <br>I don't know about Aoi, but Nana's very busy with her live rehearsals that her blog updates is one or two days late.<br>I think Re birth day preview is coming soon.</br></br>  <br>Aoi has not written anything on her blog, and Nana wasn't even in the event.<br>Most you can do is fish for comments in twitters from some of the 500 people that attended the event. We posted translation for a few of them some threads ago.</br></br>  I was watching my twitter feed for any Aoi news, and noticed that they uploaded "Best Of" scenes in the official Symphogear youtube channel.<br><br>https://twitter.com/Anime_Voice/sta<wbr>tus/616229297229967360<br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS<wbr>ECkCuFpjNrO9CQ-uvQqcg/videos</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> I think Re birth day preview is coming soon. <br>I think it was tomorrow actually<br>Correct me if I'm wrong</br></br></br>  <br>Are they region blocked?</br>  <br> Aoi <br>Nothing on her blog<br> Nana <br>Very busy with rehearsals, the start of Live Adventure 2015 is after the day GX airs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently they are.<br>Each seiyuu selected a favorite Symphogear scene, it seems.<br>For example, Ishikawa choose Genjuro VS Fine.</br></br></br>  <br>What did Chris' VA pick?<br><br>Also I have to say, Aoi and Nana are very well known, but Chris is someone I don't recognise so well, dspite her amazing talent. What are some other good anime I can hear her in (idealy singing)?</br></br></br>  <br> tfw most of Nana's fans don't watch her anime </br>  <br>Just listen to her albums.</br>  <br>What is the gear trio's favorite?</br>  <br>I can't into moon, but in case the titles have the VAs name in them</br>  <br>Episode Heart-attack of G, judging from the thumbnail.<br><br>You should know.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the mainstream fans like her mostly as an artist and not a seiyuu.</br>  <br> Hibiki rekt Chris with that same move  <br><br>Sasuga</br></br></br>  Has there been any sort of character rankings since G ended?  <br><br>Give me a second and I will check all of them.<br> Nana <br>Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki<br> Ayahi  <br>Classroom Monochrone<br> Ao-chan <br>The entire Synchrogazer scene</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They're all choosing scenes with their own characters <br>They really love their characters. That makes me fluffy inside</br></br>  <br>Those are probably the only scenes they can remember.</br>  <br>Anon don't be rude</br>  <br>Don't ruin anon's fluffy moment, anon.</br>  <br> Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki <br><br>Aw yes this scene is finally on youtube it was one of my favorites. She gets over shadowed a lot but she is probably the most skilled fighter of the bunch. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EcH<wbr>REFFvrGY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>   That one guy whose favorite scene is Chris' transformation sequence   <br>Aoi said she and Iguchi all choosed the same scene where Hibiki fought Miku in S2E10, but the rule is one people one scene.</br>  <br>Such good taste.</br>  <br>Someone I can relate to.<br><br>Did Sugita pick one? I really want to know.</br></br></br>  <br>Main animator Shikichi is always a Chris fag since S1. Most of Chris' scenes were drawn by him including that sequence.</br>   Kayano <br>DMJii at the school festival.<br> Iguchi <br>Rainbow Flower.<br> Hikasa <br>G finale scene when all the girls talk together near the end.<br> Kaneko  <br>One of those cute OVA specials.<br> Jesus Yamato <br>Tsubasa's speech during her concert in S1.<br> Ishikawa <br>Genjuro VS Fine.<br> Nana <br>Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki.<br> Nanjolno <br>Shirabe and Kirika mutual confession.<br> Ayahi  <br>Classroom Monochrone.<br> Ao-chan <br>The entire Synchrogazer scene.<br> Katsumi Ono <br>Maria singing Ressou Gugnir and going against Noise in the tower.<br> Agematsu <br>SHINFOOOOGIAAAAAAAA<br><br>There are few left out that are either animators, artist for the manga, etc<br> No Sugita or Sawashiro <br><br>What would make you believe that?<br>Seems specially incoherent when for example Aoi remembers the cantonese lyrics for Eiyuu Koji of all things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No Sugita or Mom's VA.</br>  <br> Ogawa's favorite is Tsubasa's speech in S1 <br>Sasuga prodyuusaa-san.</br></br>  <br>Well, Soichiro and Sugita are hardcore Nanafags.</br>  <br>There is a comment in the keyframes book where they said they all worked extra hard on the monochrome scene and did it all for Chris-chan.</br>  <br>That's so cute.... what a lovely bunch. I hope Chris is loved in GX too.</br>  <br>I want to fuck the dess out of her.</br>  <br>Soichiro is? I know Sugita is one because he's on the damn POP MASTER PV and he really talks about her and even makes fun of her songs sometimes. Too bad he'll forever be Sugita-kun to Nana.</br>  <br> Souichiro <br>Ninja, or Jesus Yamato's VA.</br></br>  Get to dancing, niggas.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=r6w<wbr>2mTa_zMA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yes I know who he is, I'm just surprised to know he's a hardcore Nanafag like Sugita.</br>  <br>Because he just confessed it this February.</br>  <br> Nana dance lessons <br>Wow, I haven't seen these since Live Academy.<br>You should send that to Nanoha threads since its Angel Blossom.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow, no wonder I didn't knew about it. What did he say exactly?</br>  <br> You should send that to Nanoha threads since its Angel Blossom. <br>But we're all nanafags, and its a nana song.</br></br>  I want to get into Nana<br>Which live do I watch first?</br>  <br> all Nanafags <br> Did you forget some people here are Aoifags and some people hate Nana for being popular or something?</br></br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br><br>Live Grace 2013 Opus II is my personal favorite.</br></br>  <br>I'm not<br><br>I'm here mainly for action, not songs</br></br></br>  <br>Not too much. He said he always sings Nana's songs when he goes to Karaoke or discuss Nana's songs a lot at party.</br>  <br>Maybe Live Union 2012, that was a nice concert.<br>But my favorite as of yesterday is Live Theater Acoutic 2015, because that's where you'll really know Nana isn't only good because of wubwubs and technical accompaniment.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So how is this any different from Funi subs?</br></br></br>  <br> So how is this any different <br>They exist?</br></br>  <br>Why do i feel like there's romance flags getting set?<br><br>Each Nana live has a theme of its own. For example, in Live Flight 2014, Nana really used the concept of flight and she even "flew" which caused her to get sick, in Live Theater she used the concept of a theater, formal and stuff. Live Academy, she made videos teaching dance lessons and shit. There are many to choose from, look at Wikipedia, choose one Nana concert you think sounds interesting and watch it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was asking in general quality with previous funi subs.</br></br>  <br> romance flags <br>You know when Nishikawa had a duet with Nana 2 years ago lots of Nana and Nishikawa fags thought the same thing right?</br></br>  <br>I prefer NanaXHikasa.</br>  <br>Yukarin fags will riot then.</br>  Just watched both seasons. Wish I had watched them with you guys.  <br>TMRxNana duets are great. They should do one again.</br>  <br>You are in time for S3 at least.</br>  <br>Please explain how anything in that statement makes them like funi subs. Or do you just love when commie localizes rice balls into jelly doughnuts.</br>  <br>Welcome to Nana's wild ride</br>  <br>It was better times.</br>  <br> I'm really really bothered by her crooked right incisor. I can't help myself but stare at it all the time and then feel bad about staring at it. Why hasn't she had braces to fix it yet? </br>  <br> make a live tour named Fly Fly <br> doesn't sing Kindan no Resistance <br>Nana a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Kindan no Resistance didn't exist yet.</br>  <br>It's kind of cute though.</br>  <br>This series' hype train is off the charts</br>  <br>How? Was the concert in january?</br>  <br>Is there one for S1?</br>  <br>Live Flight was in summer 2014 wasn't it? Cross Ange was in October.</br>  <br>But she sang it in the Singapore concert.</br>  Rebirth-day when  <br>But they should have recorded the song earlier. Like months earlier. I just don't know why they made the reference then.</br>  From 0 to Madoka, how much suffering is there in this show?  <br><br> Use proxmate, my fellow german. </br></br>  <br>I'd say about 3.<br>There's light suffering but it's all overcome with fighting spirit and hotblood.</br></br>  <br><br>They say it's going to be darker this time, so more than in S1 and S2.</br></br>  <br>It's hard to pinpoint it on that scale, however<br>1 = SOL<br>5 = symphogear<br>7 = Madoka<br>10 = YuYuYu<br><br>It has it's brutal suffering moments, but friendship and being true to yourself wins everytime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> YuYuYu more suffering than Madoka </br>  Some what related question, anons.<br>How many here also enjoyed the following: <br><br>-Gerren Laggan<br>-Metal Gear Rising: Revengence<br>-Kill la Kill<br>-Ace Combat Games</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is left? I just saw this episode and cannot clearly tell. Is it the new, pink concert/symphogear girl?</br>  <br> 10 = YuYuYu <br> Didn't YuYuYu cop out at the end? </br></br>  <br><br>Gurren Lagann was okay but not as good as Gainax's earlier works like Gunbuster or Blazing Transfer Student<br><br>MGR was alright but too short. Wonderful 101 was better.<br><br>I only watched KLK because I needed something to fill the void after G ending<br><br>Ace combat is alright, but I need to play it more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's her sister.</br>  <br>I can't see the point.</br>  <br>Holy shit I butchered the Gurren Lagann.</br>  <br>Yes, and I guess I should have kept it at the 9 that I originally typed. but still,  did you see my awesome fight? </br>  <br><br>Except he's right</br></br>  <br>Re is the worst offender.</br>  <br>That cop out was a cop out, based on those new LN chapters, the suffering's gonna continue.</br>  <br>Each has either a great over the top action and/or great ost.</br>  <br>Oh, then I enjoyed MGR. But I thinl Bayonetta is more fun.</br>  <br>Except YuYuYu's suffering was pretty much erased at the end. Even Madoka pre-Rebellion had more suffering by the end with Sayaka. Rebellion took it to a whole new level though.</br>  <br>How is this related?<br> GL <br>Pretty damn good, but ultimately a worse Getter Robo that was lucky enough to get proper budget/staff<br> MGR <br>Amazing. I prefer Ninja Gaiden though.<br> KLK <br>Wasted potential.<br> Ace Combat <br> COME ON!!!!!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except YuYuYu's suffering was pretty much erased at the end. <br>Confirmed for not reading the LN.</br></br>  <br>How so? I thought the cripple punishment was gone for good?</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>They're doing a lot of hinting at something being wrong with Yuuna.</br>  <br>haha, okay pal.</br>  <br>Yuuna might be 0% human.</br>  <br>Gurren Lagann is really enjoyable, though  I need to actually finish it <br><br>I need to play MGR, because it looks like the kind of game that I'd really enjoy<br><br>I wanted to like KLK, but everything felt so horridly watered down compared to his other works and especially to Symphogear that I couldn't enjoy it, even after waiting a few months and watching again <br><br> Never actually played any Ace Combat games </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> felt so horridly watered down compared to his other works <br><br>What this about? Who? Did I miss something?</br></br></br>  <br>Gurren Lagann - 8/10<br>MGR - 9/10<br>KLK - 5/10<br>Ace Combat - 7/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are KLK and Symphogear created by the same guy, or did I misread your post?</br>    <br> might be <br>And Homura IS 0% human. What's your point?</br></br>  <br>MGR seems like the perfect Tsubasa game.<br> cut up noise and other monsters <br> superhuman stunts <br> boss battles have your theme song with lyrics popping up at the finales <br>Only need to add attack cards when you do a special attack.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> -Gerren Laggan <br>Imaishi is just fucking garbage at storytelling. <br> -Metal Gear Rising: Revengence <br>Not Platinum's best, but still enjoyable.<br> -Kill la Kill <br>Terrible. All the stuff I hate about Imaishi in one show.<br> -Ace Combat Games <br>Never played them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm probably in the minority, but KLK felt watered down in comparison to Gurren, PSG, and Dead Leaves.<br>Can't really explain it properly, but it didn't feel like there was as much feeling put into it or something pretentious like that<br><br><br>You misread it, I meant to say it that felt watered down in comparison to Symphogear, as well as his other works</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka's suffering wasn't as dramatic and hard hitting as YuYuYu's. In Madoka, character's got the salvation of death, some pretty early, and therefore can't be subjugated to more suffering, but the Yusha's had to live on, each suffering for themselves and eachother.  DID YOU SEE MY AWESOME FIGHT?  Even with their daijoubu ending, YuYuYu was better.<br>Rebellion's only quality as a chinese cartoon movie, is being aesthetically pleasing.</br></br>  <br>TTGL - 6.5/10<br>MGR - 3.5/10<br>KLK - 6/10<br>Ace Combat - N/A</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The offering system is gone, but that also means that the protection from the fairies is gone.<br>The future lies in a mass-produced system that has more heroes which are less mighty and more vulnerable.<br>There's tons of suffering potential in there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Suffering for the girls was kinda the same. Turning into witches vs. becoming a full on cripple is equally shit. Although if post anime yuyuyu actually got rid of all the sacrificial lamb stuff aside from the usual child soldier danger then the wraith filled Madoka world is more shit.<br>If you take the whole state of the world as we know it into account though, then Yuyuyu definitely wins on the suffering scale just for being indefinitely on the brink of full annihilation.<br><br><br><br> Nice.  <br>I should finally start reading them. Although does this just concern Yuuna or is it implied that this will be a side effect for all the Yuusha who got something back?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>11Eyes had more suffering than Madoka. G'enei too but sadly it was retconned in the end.</br>   YuYuYufags actually think their show is better than Madoka   <br>That wouldn't even be much of an achievement.</br>  <br>I want them to leave.</br>  Can we please talk about Symphogear again?  <br>Tsubasa a perfect</br>  <br> MGR 3.5/10 <br> 3.5 <br>Well that is a first for me.</br></br></br>  <br>I know I'm in the extreme minority and I can easily see why people loved it, but I myself just...didn't.</br>  <br>Symphogear virgin here. She seems to be best girl from that image. Is she bullied for her bust size? It is important.</br>  <br>More suffering != better show.<br>Madoka had a flawless story.<br>Symphogear is still better than both combined.</br></br></br>  <br>In universe or the fandom?</br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br> Officially she is a B81 though... </br>  <br>Tsubasa is pretty best, but everyone else is too.<br>Full scan of this when?</br></br>  <br>Im universe, no. Fandom, occasionally.</br>  madokafags pls go  <br> Perfect <br>While she's the best Sympho, I wish she was  more  flat</br></br>  <br>We are just Aoifags.</br>  I'm glad that even in a symphothread we can all agree that Pleiades &gt; symphogear &gt; yuyuyu &gt; madoka.  <br>No.<br>Symphogear &gt; *</br></br>  <br>But does pleiaedses has mechs?</br>  <br> Madoka had a flawless story. <br><br>No. It was a cop out from a good ending into more grimdark shit that became Rebellion and which ended even worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Are we really so bored that we have to start this kind of shit now?<br><br><br>Does car advertisement count?</br></br></br></br>  <br> symphogear &gt; yuyuyu &gt; madoka &gt; pleiades <br>Now it's correct.<br><br>Only really fault of Pleiades to be below all other shows is that main girl has a boy love interest who looks like a girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Does car advertisement count? <br>It didn't have any though. It has astrophysics though.<br><br><br>And unlike any pairing in any of the other shows they actually kissed. Having a guy who looks like a girl kissing another girl is the closest you will ever get to a yuri kiss in any of these shows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How was the original anime a cop out from a good end? The movies were shit and Rebellion a simple cash grab and sequel hook that has yet to produce a good follow up and I hope that no one actually means those when they talk about the series.</br>  <br>If there's really nothing to talk about until we get for information, there is no need to start this shit. <br><br><br>Completely disgusting /u/ mentality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if the car can transform into a bipedal robot.</br>  <br>I thought their staffs, brooms, whatever were kinda related to the cars or something?</br>  Stop talking about other shows you fucking faggots.  <br>Be the change you want to see</br>  <br>They were, but apart from the car-sounds they made it never played any role. It never tried to advertise anything at all.<br><br><br>By leaving Homura behind and putting her into another stupid world where she had to continue fighting. Madoka should just have taken her with her when she became a goddess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine. Lets talk about why FIS is better than the original trio.</br>  <br> Only really fault of Pleiades to be below all other shows is that main girl has a boy love interest who looks like a girl. <br><br>Yeah, that was some pretty shitty pandering a whole useless part of the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> I hope that no one actually means those when they talk about the series. <br>No, don't worry, they don't.<br><br> Yeah, that was some pretty shitty pandering a whole useless part of the anime. <br>I really honestly hope this is supposed to be sarcastic, and not a serious post, because this shit is faceook-tier.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pandering <br><br>Stop using words if you have no clue what they mean.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck does this even mean?</br>  <br>Surprisingly, I unironically agree.<br><br>Maria, even in her normal 'boring' state, is someone I would really enjoy spending time with, and when she's faking her cool persona she's great to watch. I like how protective and caring she is, both in general and towards the two idiots, and I don't mind her being cowardly, as her less active approach to life is one I myself prefer over, say, Hibiki's.<br><br>As such, because I'm just as boring etc as Maria, it comes as almost no surprise (despite my usual hatred of lolis and lolifags) that I really really like both Kirika and Shirabe. Yes, Shirabe is currently my least favorite of the GEAHs, but not only is it for completely understandable reasons, but I can see her getting quite a bit better with some more time in the spotlight. Kirika, on the other hand, is pretty much the best kind of child a parent could ever hope for, and given my strong desire to be as good a parent as possible, the DESSfag easily skyrocketed to the top for me.<br><br>That's not to say that I have anything against the main trio though, as Tsubasa and Chris are both very well written and exceptionally lovable in their own right, and I would currently put them tied at second best. Hibiki, on the other hand, just doesn't cut it for me currently, and I really hope that won't damage my enjoyment of GX.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Re-birthday that aired on Ayahi's radio show is not full version.  <br>Still want to hear it.

I think I'd put YuYuYu a bit above it though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pleiades was great <br>I don't deny that, still it didn't move me as much as Madoka or YuYuYu at the time when it aired, and wasn't as guilty fun as Symphogear was every season.<br><br>Still better than Wixoss, Precure series or that tarot card magical anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I'm not really feeling it yet. Meteor Light is still the best.</br>  <br>http://a.uguu.se/cvnhst.mp3</br>  <br>It was probably because Pleiades is actually a mahou shoujo played completely straight, which is really rare these days outside of Precure. There wasn't any suffering outside of maybe episode 10. The series is worth watching just for Stella-rium though.<br><br>Wixoss had potential but there was just too much stupid shit for me to enjoy it completely, plus they didn't focus enough on why Ruu was so obsessed with battoru. And Spread was retarded. Both seasons had god-tier OPs though.<br><br>Haven't watched Precure but I heard that Heartcatch was the darker and edgier season that's been a tough act to follow, and the subsequent seasons have been mediocre or otaku-pandering like Smile. <br><br>CHICKEN SALAD had some good ideas and designs that were ruined by a retarded committee, and I don't think it was ever able to shake off its status of "Madoka ripoff" like YuYuYu was able to. It's kinda sad that the producers were clearly expecting it to become a big hit.<br><br>Also to keep it Symphogear related:<br>Synchrogazer &gt; Exterminate &gt; Vitalization</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing it did better was characterization.</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br>I liked the premise of the suffering more than "Aliens need little girl suffering energy". Also the world was more interesting as well.</br>  <br> Heartcatch was the darker and edgier season <br>That's the stupidest shit I've read all day</br></br>  <br>Genei had actually been in development since before Madoka. Whether the entire story was planned before Madoka or after/influenced by it is unknown. As for YuYuYu, even the staff said it was compaired to Madoka a lot and so they had to try to be different.

Fucking cancer.</br></br>  <br>I liked the premise of Madoka more than "God takes away bodily functions chosen by the writers for suffering". The imouto losing her voice just felt too manufactured. So, opinions I guess.<br>The world was more interesting, I'll agree, but Madoka was never about that. But sure, I'll give you that one.</br></br>  <br>Because both don't have yellow senpai-type characters that go crazy when they learn the truth, right?<br><br><br>I'm surprised there isn't one up right now. They love to make back to back never-ending generals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>S2 when?</br>  <br>It's mostly YuYuYu haters AKA Madokafags.</br>  <br> The only reason people don't call it a Madoka ripoff that much here is because they think it is the new and improved Madoka and therefore the greatest thing ever. <br><br>So is yucky tuna the hipster Madoka of Evangelion?<br> Also I never really felt the similarities that much, but to each their own if they feel the need to compare every mahou shoujo to Madoka nowadays I'll let them be. </br></br></br></br>  Symphogear - when mahou shoujo gets physical<br><br>Pleiades - when mahou shoujos are all pacifist<br><br>Wixoss - when mahou shoujos tried playing Yu-Gi-Oh<br><br>YuYuYu - when mahou shoujos need to change their smartphone<br><br>Madoka - when mahou shoujo burns out<br><br>They're all about mahou shoujo, turn off your brain and enjoy the girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  SO HOW ABOUT THAT SYMPHOGEAR GUYS?<br>I HEAR IT'S STARTING IN LIKE TWO DAYS.</br>  <br> Symphogear - when mahou shoujo gets physical <br>I want to see mahou shoujo go mental.

Pidgeon holing people like this is stupid as fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking more traditional mahou shojou. Like a show where the whole group is like Mami after she breaks, but with their own quirks to set them apart.</br>  <br>/a/utism.</br>  <br>Look at all the "lol they think they're think is better than Madoka" posts. It's most of them.<br><br>Reading comprehension. "Mostly". There's also YuYuYufags.<br><br>Now everybody do this or talk about Symphogeah now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you'd read my post then you'd see that I admitted that the two shows share some character designs, mainly Fuu/Mami and to a lesser degree Tougou/Homura. And even though both Fuu and Mami go crazy upon learning the truth, what they do afterward is different (Mami tries to commit triple murder-suicide, Fuu goes into open rebellion), and Tougou and Homura are completely different characters.<br><br>Also the multitude of YuYuYu threads lately is because there's new material coming out, just like there's more Symphogear threads in anticipation of GX.<br><br>Can't somebody just love both Madoka and YuYuYu? And Symphogear too? Not Gen'ei though, fuck Gen'ei.</br></br></br></br></br>  This thread reminded me that I should watch YuYuYu off my backlog.<br> After I finish Sora no Woto </br>  <br>Insecurity in their own tastes and a need to downplay those who enjoy something else for not enjoying their favorite things instead? I mean, I have no love for Madoka and I used to be that kind of person, but it got pathetic after a while.</br>  <br>Just stop already.</br>  <br>I'm mostly talking about the ones that keep posting shit about people that think YuYuYu is better than Madoka. That's also pretty stupid.</br>  <br> Sora no Woto <br>Great. Can we at least shitpost about that instead?</br></br>  <br>  Not Gen'ei though, fuck Gen'ei. <br>You shouldn't say this just because Gen'ei has the smallest fanbase among these shows anon.</br></br>  <br>Aoi Yuuki once again voices best girl<br> I JOE YOU JOE </br></br>  <br>Go away.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yeah and that mostly is totally bullshit when half of the posts are from Yuyuyufags going on about how much superior their show is. If you faggots want to circlejerk about Yuyuyu that much or start Madoka vs. Yuyuyu shitflinging feel free to make an appropriate thread for it instead and stop shifting the blame.</br>  <br>You could also stop. Just an idea.</br>  <br>I love all 4 and there is nothing you can do about it</br>  <br>Fat ass. I like it.</br>  <br>But Yuyuyu has no Ao-chan.</br>  Describe bikibutt.

Exposure to one or multiple traumatic occurrences of a close friend or family member leaving (abandonment or fate of mortality) would make the person unable to form true and affectionate attachments towards people <br>Not him, but her background fits</br></br>  <br>Shikinami will roundhouse kick you in the face if you see her bits</br>  <br><br>from psychnet:<br><br>  Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern of attention seeking behavior and extreme emotionality. Someone with histrionic personality disorder wants to be the center of attention in any group of people, and feel uncomfortable when they are not. While often lively, interesting and sometimes dramatic, they have difficulty when people aren’t focused exclusively on them. People with this disorder may be perceived as being shallow, and may engage in sexually seductive or provocative behavior to draw attention to themselves. </br></br></br></br>  <br>She was mad at Shinji. When he wasn't around she was fine.</br>  <br>If you were stuck with your teenage body for 14 years, wouldn't you be pissed?

Shinji was tricked and had literally no agency whatsoever in near third impact. Asuka should be mad at Gendo, Misato, or Ritsuko, not Shinji.</br>  <br>True.

She's not a woman, knows she never had been and can't ever be.</br>  <br>Shikinami has a foot fetish.</br>  <br> daring to compare the original with the Rebuild knockoff <br><br>The amount of character development Asuka had in nge/eoe by herself was more than all of the Rebuild characters in all three movies combined. Not only that but in the original Asuka was clearly meant to serve as foil to Shinji in terms of personality while still having the same problems as him.</br></br></br>  <br> meant to serve as foil to Shinji while still having the same problems as him. <br>So were Misato and Rei.</br></br>  So did Asuka really hate everyone (Shinji included)?  <br> We have seen every inch of Asuka and Rei except for their nipples and vag <br><br>I'm not sure how to feel about that<br><br><br>That's not Shinji's fault it's from her entry plug sliding toward the core's Great Beyond Depth while she was in Unit 03.<br><br>All four pilots do this in some fashion at the end of 2.<br> Rei sucked into Zeruel's core <br> Asuka and Unit 03 <br> Mari and Za Beasto <br> Shinji and Unit 01 <br><br>She's probably mad at him for sitting on his thumbs and letting her get mangled by Unit 01's dummy plug.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She loved Kaji</br>  <br>Misato, yes, but Rei has her own unique problems. Rei's arc is that of a being searching for identity. That struggle is different from Shinji's.</br>  Did rebuild Sasuka hae Shinji at the end of 3.0? I don't get why she didn't kill him on sight.    <br>True but Asuka always stood out more with her polar opposite personality. Misato was somewhat distanced from the others since she was much older and was interacting with Kaji. Rei is so far out there she doesn't even realize she has problems for most of the series.<br><br>The only true constant between all four of them is that their development in Rebuild has been significantly worse.</br></br></br>  <br> the only one who could have made Asuka happy turned out to be a homo <br>Fuck this gay Earth.</br></br>  <br>No, she hated herself above all. And berated people to keep them away.</br>  <br>No, she was fed up with his moping, self-centered attitude and for not doing anything to help out. She doesn't seem to hate him or ReiQ.</br>  <br>She'd still have had to kill him in the end, though.</br>  <br>She didn't give a damn about Kaji. He was just an adult male to get attention from. It was all about Shinji the moment Asuka realized he was another Eva pilot - he was the only one that Asuka could allow herself to feel equal to without destroying her entire bloated ego. Even then with Shinji it was still mostly about her.</br>  <br><br>They all had different circumstances that made them unique enough from each other, but the core problem was there in all of them: they needed to learn to accept/love themselves. In Shinji's case in particular, almost everyone served as a foil to him not just Asuka.</br></br>  <br>It still would have been interesting to see how his presence would have affected her in the long run. Also would put a whole new disturbing twist on the MP Eva fight.</br>  <br><br>Rebuild Asuka resembled the generic tsundere archetype that Soryu popularized more than Soryu. All of the character motivations and interactions are a mess on the surface with no substance beneath.<br><br><br>Nobody is arguing that. I'd just say there was a heavier focus on Shinji and Asuka's relationship than any other.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I will never understand this. Kaworu was easily the worst executed character in the original. He was there solely to move the plot along and was hardly mentioned again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She didn't give a damn about Kaji.  <br>Which is why Asuka called out Kaji-san's name repeatedly to help her after she got mindraped by Arael and Kaji was already dead, right?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I actually wanted to see Kaworu interacting with others, not in a romantic capacity. Just to have that fag in a new role bringing different dynamics, but Q just made him really one note by boosting the gayness. He can't function without Shinji</br></br></br>  <br> was easily the worst executed character in the original <br>Nah, that award goes to Gendo. A shallow plot-device with no depth or character despite all the screentime he got. So bad they had to resolve his character in EoE with 3 generic 'I didndunuffin' lines.<br>The thing about LAK is that Asuka needed a Kaworu much more in her life then Shinji, it's just interesting to think about how it would have affected her character and the overall story. Not to even bring up the fact that he's a literal teenage Kaji.<br><br><br>This. They ruined any trace of potential he had in the previous two movies. Fucking Anno doesn't want him to move past the shitty perfect Iku-chan husbando stage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thing about LAK is that Asuka needed a Kaworu much more in her life then Shinji <br><br>That's what Mari was made for.</br></br></br>  <br> a heavier focus on Shinji and Asuka's relationship than any other <br>Not really. Asuka shows up almost half way through the show and is relevant for about 5 episodes before she goes coma. It was always about Shinji and Misato more than anything, she's the heroine after all.</br></br>  <br> She's probably mad at him for sitting on his thumbs and letting her get mangled by Unit 01's dummy plug. <br><br>Possible. It doesn't seem like it's about impact or the curse since expositing about those is the most she talks to him without snarling and he's brat Shinji instead of worldkiller Shinji.</br></br></br>  <br> The thing about LAK is that Asuka needed a Kaworu much more in her life then Shinji <br>Okay, I can't be the only one who thinks they wouldn't get along? Shinji and Asuka are outwardly different. Anytime they meet in other canon/universes they hate each other. Not to mention they are the complete antithesis of each other. This is shown in their relationship to Shinji.</br></br>  <br>That and merchandise, yeah.</br>  <br> Asuka needed a Kaworu much more in her life then Shinji <br><br> one completely ignores her, lost in his own problems without realizing hers <br> the other unconditionally loves her for no reason other than that she has problems <br><br>Both sound pretty bad to me, at least Shinji forced some character development on both sides.<br><br>There are reasons why Kaworu and Mari are disliked in Eva - they are completely static with little insight into their own mind and history. The two major differences between them is that Kaworu at least affected the plot a little before fucking off and that Mari refuses to fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu not realizing 'Adam' was Lilith until they were face to face just becomes a convoluted mess once we learn that and his true identity. I am glad the movies established that difference right off the bat.<br><br><br>How so? Shikinami's a hot-shot wannabe lone wolf who gets knocked off her high horse by the 8th Angel and realizes relying on others isn't terrible. That follows through to the next movie when she's Wille's point man but expects Mari to be there covering her back.<br><br>She looks down on Shinji because she thinks he got the Unit 01 seat from being the Commander's son. When he comes back, she realizes he's still a bratty child out of his depth and she has no patience to deal with it.<br><br>The characters are consistent with each other from 1 to 2 to 3. What might be inconsistent Gendo/Seele's plans and how much is keikaku or just bullshitting stuff as it comes up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shinji and Asuka are outwardly different. <br>And by this I meant that Kaworu probably wouldn't fall in love with Asuka because one of the things Kaworu really liked about Shinji was his modesty/shyness. <br>It'd be cool if they were friends however, just that Asuka might have to tone it down though.</br></br></br>  <br> The characters are consistent with each other from 1 to 2 to 3. <br>Asuka's mommy issues are completely gone and her latching on to older figures (Kaji) and attention-seeking behavior is gone too, which made up 80 percent of her original character.<br><br>Shittynami a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> in terms of motivation, Shinji and Asuka are essentially the exact same <br> both have very similar histories and family situations as well <br> the biggest difference is that Shinji turns inward and Asuka outward to avoid their problems <br> despite this they spend the entire show hating each other without even knowing why, failing to understand themselves or show compassion for others <br> &gt;this is why the ending scene of eoe is so great </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaworu really liked about Shinji was his modesty/shyness. <br>Kaworu loved Shinji because he deserved to be loved. Kaworu is the embodiment of the concept that all people deserve love, regardless of their flaws.</br></br>  <br> Mari and Asuka were going to be rivals for the Unit 02 seat <br> Mari was going to get Unit 02 and know Kaji and Asuka was going to be stuck on the sidelines. <br><br>I'm glad they changed that plot but I do wish they'd kept some of the rivalry between Mari and Asuka in 2.0, like Mari could have been the runner up for Unit 02 and that's how she got in tight with Nerv Euro and earned the Unit 05/8 position.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I personally prefer rebuild Rei, seeing her develop a personality is great.</br>  <br>He acts exactly as Kaji does in personality, plus he's patient and willing to listen to problems and give attention. All Asuka really needed was someone who would love her for her instead of putting her to standards and expectations, and Kaworu fits the bill.<br> they meet in other canon/universes <br>Those universes aren't canon and aren't made by Anno and co. In the drafts she was smitten, she even started a fanclub at school for him.<br><br><br> Kaworu disliked in Eva <br>He's really not, though. There's a reason why he's one of the most memorable of the cast. He has more character and depth to him than Maya, Hyuga, and Aoba despite them receiving far more screentime then him. <br> they are completely static <br>He's as static as Ramiel or Sachiel. He's an angel in a MoTW show, and has as much depth as one would expect him to be as such. He fulfills his role with his relationship to Shinji as Armisael did to Rei and Arael did to Asuka. Unlike the major shit that is Mari, Kaworu contributed to the show in a reasonable and expected manner and gave it substance and memorability in his episode. Mari is just a whole bunch of nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What the fuck is this bitch's problem? <br>Germany lost the chance of winning the women's fifa cup last night.</br></br>  <br> All Asuka really needed was someone who would love her for her instead of putting her to standards and expectations, and Kaworu fits the bill. <br>True that someone with many of Kaworu's traits would work but that doesn't have to mean Kaworu himself.<br> Those universes aren't canon and aren't made by Anno and co. <br> made by Anno <br>After the End is, and they hated each other there. Kaworu actually starting ragging on Asuka's personality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is Kaworu static? He's fine for what he is, which is just another angel in the show. It's actually hilarious how despite receiving only 10 minutes of screentime he had more to him than Gendo ever did. Jesus fuck, Gendo is such a shallow shit character, and in Rebuild he's even worse.</br>  <br>*started</br>  <br>as someone that just finished watching it for the first time i think her anta-bakaism was a result from shoving her sadness way deep into herself and decided to become strong to not be in pain anymore resulting in her acting like a cunt</br>  <br>It's interesting how this dialogue can also be applied to the Unit 03 situation.<br><br><br>So? If you want NGE, watch NGE. Rebuild's not telling the same exact story so that's your problem. Her personality in 3 follows from her personality in 2.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he had more to him than Gendo ever did. <br>What? Did you completely forget about Gendo's self hatred and obsession with Yui?</br></br>  <br> I'm honestly surprised she didn't turned out suicidal like her mother <br><br><br>It's been quite a while since I saw Evangelion so sorry If I'm missing something here. But wasn't there a scene where she tried to kill herself? The one where she lies in the bathtub? For me it always looked like she tried to slit her wrists.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that doesn't have to mean Kaworu himself <br>True, it doesn't. It's just a silly crackpairing and it's fun to think about their possible dynamic with eachother. At the end of the day it's just fanfiction bullshit, no need to get triggered and take it seriously.<br><br> After the End is <br>So we have Asuka loving Kaworu in the drafts and Asuka hating Kaworu in the Drama CD. It's a 1 on 1 situation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me too. I also like ReiQ and I hope the ending allows the two of them to coexist and show that they can develop as their own people.</br>  <br> Gendo's self hatred and obsession with Yui <br>Which is never expanded on AT ALL. Gendo's role in the show is essentially be a plot device for Shinji, spout cryptic generic one-liners and look menacing with his shitty pose. He's literally nothing but shallow, and even Fuyutsuki has more character to him thanks to the backstory episode. He gets no resolution or expansion in the final two episodes and his character is forced into completion with 3 quick lines in EoE.</br></br>  <br>It looked like rust and wear in the tub to me, but the scene is definitely supposed to imply she's committing suicide by slitting or starvation.</br>  <br>The folded clothes gives it away.</br>  <br> Me too. I also like ReiQ and I hope the ending allows the two of them to coexist and show that they can develop as their own people. <br><br>That's a pointless question because you know it's already true. They can coexist (they already are), and there's literally nothing stopping them from developing as "their own people" to begin with.<br><br>Also you're a faggot for liking Rei Q, a character whose entire existence is to belittle the character she's based on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Abandonment issues by a batshit insane mother who hung herself.</br>  1 day 4 hours to go<br>Who's going to be watching?</br>  Not me  is this all out yurishit  <br>Some hetero and incest but no yuri</br>  <br><br>It's Slice of Life comedy with super powers mixed in. <br><br>Basically each kid has a super power and their father is the king of the country and to decide the next king their life is going to be watch 24/7 like a reality tv show and the people of the country are going to vote on who they want to be the next king. <br><br>Trying to find the post in the archive that mentions their individual powers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh found it. <br><br>From left to right. <br><br>Ai Kayano as Eldest daughter Aoi.

Might be fun to hear HanaKana act chuuni.  <br>Wait I copied the text of the old post but it should be right to left shouldn't it.</br>  It sounds like Minami-ke: Superpower Edition  <br>Should do she's only at the end of volume 2 and these things tend to get in almost 3 volumes of 4koma. <br><br> I'm looking forward to her too, fantastic design </br></br></br>  is this the illustrator of ore twintail?  <br>Yeah same artist.</br>  <br>yep</br>  Is this yuri?  Iirc all the twintail girls are showing up in side character roles here. I wonder if they'll get Nobunaga to voice Souji's doppelganger.  NO YURI WE RIOT  <br><br>this went completely under my radar<br><br>again with genderbender or something?</br></br></br></br>   Series Composition: Reiko Yoshida <br>oh god</br>  <br>Power rankings<br>Aoi (powers too strong)<br>Akane<br>Shuu<br>Misaki (Imagine the sex)<br>Teru<br>Shiori <br>Kanade<br>Hikari<br>Haruka<br><br>Kanade's power sounds great but getting the money must be a ballache.<br><br><br>No genderbender just powers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Souji's doppelganger. <br>You mean the Akane FC leader? <br>That glasses guy right?</br></br></br>  <br> Reiko Yoshida <br>Fuck yes.<br><br>Picked the fuck up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup. There aren't too many male characters in the series. Other than him there's the producer too but that seems like more fun role for him.</br>  So how much romance is in this? Hopefully not too much.  I hope this is good. I like the sound of it and the cast looks great. Also everyone's really cute.   Kirara <br> No yuri undertones <br>Expect it to bomb.</br></br>  This gives me Tokyo ESP vibes and I don't like it.  <br><br>YUP!</br></br>  <br>But it had</br>  <br>There's no fighting really. No enemy faction or whatever like that. <br><br><br>Very little, but it's there. It's cute anyway and not just chapters of misunderstandings.  The one who confessed to Shuu, forgot her name, did it in one chapter or something? Someone might remember </br></br></br></br>  <br> had <br>I see what you did there.  Honestly it is SoL about family's everyday life so i hope no yurifags or any other fags shitting up the thread. </br></br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br><br>I'd say Minami-ke tier.</br></br>  Looks cute, Story sounds like it could be fun to watch.  <br>Yeaaahhh</br>  <br>Shuu's girlfriend is a qt3.14.</br>  There's a group doing the manga, dumping it now.    <br>But they're sisters!<br><br> which is even better </br></br></br>        <br> mainly to her twintails </br>      <br>Red looks cute as fuck but it sucks she is voiced by HanaKana.</br>      <br>I like the chapter where she and Akane go to a <br>cafe, such a qt<br><br><br>Any idea how long it will take them to catch up? Surprised this found a group over the other 4koma stuff that still doesn't have one. <br>Although I wish groups wouldn't keep honorifics.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Dunno.</br>        <br> no red x MC <br>Why?</br></br>    <br>How far have they gotten?</br>      <br><br>Cant find this in batoto, is this uploaded somewhere</br></br>    <br>Scanlator blog.</br>      <br><br><br>Oh my god these character designs.</br></br></br>    why should i care about this series?                  <br>Little Akane a cute</br>      Who's the MC?  <br> Club aid <br>Huh, strange choice of words.</br></br>  <br>The shy one</br>    <br>There isn't really a single MC, but Akane, Kanade and Aoi tend to get a lot more time spent on them. <br><br>But then you can go whole chapters where they just don't show up at all.</br></br></br>       Production IMS       <br>The QUALITY can't be THAT bad, r-right?</br>  This should've been short instead of Wakaba Girl.    <br>Well. I'd imagine any action sequences will look like garbage</br>    <br>Wakaba Girl doesn't sound that interesting really. Plus that's got 1 volume only. <br><br><br>There's only going to be about 2/3 so I wouldn't worry too much about it. Haruka's power looks like shit, but it's a shit power anyway.</br></br></br></br>  And that's the latest translated chapter that I could find.  <br>IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU CARE!</br>  <br> Mosaic censor  <br>How exactly does the clone made?</br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br> Haruka's power looks like shit, but it's a shit power anyway. <br>Doesn't stopped him being such smooth player.</br></br>  <br>Thanks<br><br><br>I don't want to think about it. I think shitting them out is probably the least gruesome procedure.</br></br></br></br>  Is this Twintails S2? If so I'm hyped  <br>This was such a funny chapter. Haruka is really cute though. <br><br>Just think, Haruka knows exactly what % chance he has to get laid.</br></br></br>  <br>He probably has the best power.<br>Well, most practical at the very least despite everybody else having HAX bullshit.</br></br>  Does the king has multiple wives or the queen is just that vertile?  What will happen to Teru  if the seal is broken  <br>Will he went full Hulk?</br>  <br>oh yes they will, you can already see them in this thread</br>  <br>based</br>  <br>He'd be really good at the horse races I'll admit that. But everyone does just have hax bullshit powers. It's better than Shiori maybe, but if he did have to fight someone like Kanade he'd get fucked. <br><br>Practical on a large scale, like playing the markets or ruling a country. But as a personal power seems pretty shit. <br><br><br>I think it's just limiting him for now since he wouldn't be able to control it. He's only 6 or something so he probably doesn't have a proper grasp on it yet and it'd be dangerous to let him go all out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  WHY ISN;T IT YURI  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br> implying  <br>it matters if anything is yuri or not, you fags will strap on your maximum goggles anyways</br></br>  <br>The king is insatiable. 9 kids isn't too hard if they have one every year which they pretty much did.</br>   yuri <br> incest <br><br>I wish we could have at least one anime that didn't pander to the sexual fetishes of degenerates</br></br></br>  I'm still curious why Kanade has a hard-on for Shuu. It's pretty funny seeing her get jealous when she hears about Katou (?). Forgot what her name was, but Shuu's future waifu.  <br>There's yuri?<br><br><br>Probably something that they did as kids, usually is. Can't blame her, Shuu is great.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Red hair as in Akane is the MC.</br>  <br>So this basically the Brady Bunch<br><br>who's Alice?</br></br></br>  <br> I wish we could have at least one anime that didn't pander to the sexual fetishes of degenerates <br>But that would be boring then.</br></br>  Does anyone have the rest of these and in a better size?  <br>Red and Yellow are best girls.</br>  <br>Misaki best bodies<br>Akane close second<br>Haruka could pass as a trap</br></br></br>  <br>Hoping it's yuri, I need more Kirara after Kiniro Mosaic.</br>  <br>Your only chance at kirara yuri next season is Wakaba Girl.</br>  <br>With this many girls? I doubt this is not yuri and nobody here can read the raws so fuck off.</br>  <br>I don't know, all these people discussing things from untranslated chapters earlier tells me you might be wrong.</br>  <br>Yeah just like people who read the raws of GochiUsa said it was not yuri, right? I know what I should expect from a Kirara series and with a cast like this, and I hope I won't get disappointed.</br>  <br>Akane and Kanade and Shuu's waifu wants the Teleporting D.</br>  <br>I'm just saying, you're going to be disappointed. Just like Love Lab.<br><br><br>And Misaki wants Haruka. Akane has a fanclub that wants to fuck her, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's retarded yurifags, don't need to respond.</br>  <br> Love Lab <br>It's not Kirara though.</br></br>  <br>Who wouldn't want Shuu's teleporting D? Think about the amazing things you could do with it.<br><br>Also Kanade a best, but all girls are pretty great.</br></br></br>  <br>I really like Kanade. I think it's because of her relationship with Shuu. Too bad she got one upped by the twintails cutie.</br>  http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr>  So Fat Beerus is God of Universe 6.<br><br>Awesome.</br></br>  <br> “Dragon Ball Super” is a complete continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting! <br>Sounds to me like it will first make a connection between Z and BotG and then take on the new arc. I doutbt they'll revamp BotG and RoF like some anons were saying</br></br>  <br>I wonder how different Universe 6 will be to the main one</br>  <br>The way I read it, seems it takes place after the latest movie. "Continues the with the battle of gods arc".<br><br>Seeing them going to new universes is pretty awesome. I just want Uub to show up one day</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's what I meant. Interconnect Z with BotG and then make the time skip to post RoF.<br> continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. </br></br>  FoG subs when  <br>In b4 a universe where every character is genderbent<br><br> girl goku </br></br></br>  I just realized a plot hole if Super is going to take place before the epilogue of DBZ.<br><br>In DBZ, Goku stated the main reason he decided to train Uub is so he could have such an incredibly powerful opponent to face. However, since the introduction of Gods of Destruction, there are tons of enemies stronger than Goku for him to fight.<br><br>So unless Goku becomes the strongest being in the entire multiverse within 10 years, the epilogue makes no sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6 <br><br><br>what if uneverse 6 is gt universe</br></br></br></br>  <br>GIANT SUPER DRAGON BALLS<br><br>Maybe that 9-star ball on the V-Jump magazine manga adaptation wasn't a mistake!</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Battle of Gods made it so Goku never meets Uub</br>  Wait so will it be starting straight after buus defeat or after RoF? I don't get it  <br>Uub appeared in the tournament 10 years after the events of Kid Buu. BoG doesn't take place nearly as long as that. His meeting with Uub hasn't been retconned.</br>  <br>If Uub is able to harness his potential, he might potentially be greater than any warrior we've seen yet. It remains to be seen. Also, Goku never explicitly stated that, it's just heavily implied.<br><br>Battle of Gods, Super, and Revival of F take place in the 10 years between Majin buu's defeat and the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai, where they meet Uub.</br></br></br>  <br>Both. They'll tackle Buu's aftermath first and then move to post RoF</br>  <br> an angry sexy Vegeta with a hard on for Goku </br>  <br>Would you?<br>Could you?<br>Should you?</br></br></br>  <br>it seems to be retconning both BoG and RoF into happening right after Buu's defeat, having arcs that completely retell the movies.<br><br>Makes you wonder what was the point of the movies, then.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the epilogue has officially been retconned now since it's stated that Goku hasn't seen anyone else since the Majin Buu incident</br>  <br> it seems to be retconning both BoG and RoF into happening right after Buu's defeat, having arcs that completely retell the movies. <br>What makes you think that?<br>The series will probably assume you have alredy watched both movies and after the post buu arc it will move to the 6th universe arc</br></br></br>  <br>Making money<br>Raise awareness for DB again<br>Making money</br></br></br>  <br>Only parts of it. Uub still happened.</br>  <br>  Hey Kakarot, after this battle how about you come back to my ship and I'll show you my Big Bang? </br>  <br>We'll still get Uub I think but it'll be tailored to fit into the new storyline</br>  <br>I wonder which universe is Future Trunk's.</br>  <br>Actually the epilogue stated it's been 5 years since he met everyone, which is what's covered by BoG. <br><br>Of course, that means he wouldn't be able to meet everyone in Super, which takes place directly afterwards. And that won't happen.</br></br></br>  <br> Would you? <br>yeah, a girl with the same personality as goku would be really cute<br> Could you? <br>idk maybe? i have a lot of energy but im just a human, not a saiyajin<br> Should you? <br>Probably no, but who cares? i would train and fight with her even if it cost me my life</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. It'll happen in a similar way, but be altered a bit for the new movies. Pan and Bra will be there too, since Pan was in the last movie with Grunkle Piccolo.<br><br> Bra might end up as the strongest hybrid, thinking about it. Veggie has the God ki, and remember how much stronger Trunks got with Vegeta around? </br></br></br>  Ok so it will take place after buy saga before BotG? I hope they don't re-tell it. Love that movie so much, and what's the deal with this new universe? Are the events of BotG told differently in that universe? Will the 2nd arc take place after RoF? Someone explain this to me for I am stupid.  <br>Do you think you could keep Vegeta away from Goku?</br>  All the other universes being just alternate versions of them would be dumb and lazy.<br><br>Unfortunately that's exactly what i expect they will be.</br></br>  <br>Post-Buu<br><br>Timeskip<br><br>Multiverse<br><br>at least that's sort of what it sounds like to me<br><br>there better not be a mary sue version of Goku's mom thought up by the French in there</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see   </br>  <br>there needs to be a variation where personalities are completely changed<br><br>like yamcha is an alpha that actually trains<br>vegeta is a complete pussy that only fights when he has to<br>piccolo is a goody two-shoes who is very open and friendly<br>goku is very affectionate and cares more about making love to chi chi than anything<br>frieza could be an ally in one of the universes<br><br>just a few random ideas</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> goku is very affectionate and cares more about making love to chi chi than anything <br>Goku and Chi-chi single-handedly repopulate the Saiyan race through their fuckin'</br></br>  <br>Only if she's fit, none of this turning a muscular dude into a small skinny waifu crap.</br>  I really dislike the idea of just slightly alternate versions of existing characters in the other universe. I'm ok with maybe some of the top level people such as the god of destruction and some of the kai's being similar looking, but not the regular denizens of the universe.  Okay, so from what I understand,<br> The two new movies are continuations of the manga and introduce the idea that there are 12 universes <br> Movies/manga universe is the seventh universe <br> Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br> Super's first two arcs are retellings of the two movies with some differences like Champa <br> The third arc is a crossover battle with the sixth universe (notice they didn't specify what universe Super took place in, only that the sixth universe were their neighbors) <br><br>It opens the possibility of there being a GT universe, an Online universe, and other things like that where history plays out differently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didnt really want them to go to a different universe but after Beerus mentioned thered be 12 universes I knew it was inevitable.</br>  <br> &gt;Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br>Where was this confirmed</br></br>  <br>So it's after BotG? That doesn't make sense considering goku turns SSJ and not SSJGSS, and discovers Beerus for the 1st time in the trailer, unless it takes place in universe 6? Why is there another universe and why can't they just continue the story after RoF? What's the deal with this multiverse arc and are the characters in each universe meeting each other? Maybe after the events of this multiverse arc, the characters that represent their respective universe go their separate ways and then they continue the story after RoF which would mean RoF already happened, right? It would go like this I'm assuming.<br> After Buu <br> after BotG <br> After RoF <br> Zfighters discover new universe <br> see themselves, fat beerus blah blah <br> work together to fight evil threat <br> characters from universe 6 go back home  <br> they continue the story of the main timeline after that <br>Unless it takes place after BotG and before RoF which leads to all of this shit and THEN whis trains goku/vegeta. Then after that, the next arc takes place after RoF. This multiverse thing seems like filler to me, but I guess it could be fun. Am I close or just being retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br>What else is in your ass. Please keep taking stuff out of it, I want to see what else you can come up with</br></br>  <br>what if it's like, just the same kinds of races, but not characters?<br><br>like Saiyans are still around somewhere, but there's no Goku or Vegeta or anything, there's like, maybe some guy, who's sort of an asshole but not, named like, Artichoke<br><br>and there are Namekians, but no Piccolo or Guru or anyone, like maybe there's a dude named Mollus, who is a Super Namekian like Piccolo but talks and acts like some sort of bancho punk dude that flies around space getting into WACKY HIJINKS with his crew of oddball sidekicks<br><br>there are still Earthlings, but maybe they're not complete idiots? Also the champion of the Earth is like, a Luchador Cyborg Bear or something silly<br><br>fuck it, maybe the Tuffles are the race of heroes of the universe? Defeating the Arcosians or whatever Frieza's race was called and helping establish a peaceful galaxy. With space-hobbit science.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 takes place only 6 months after Buu.<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You're just being retarded. Its gonna be <br> Z <br> post buu arc (Super) <br> Beerus arc (Battle of the Gods) <br> Golden Freeza arc (Return of F) <br> Rest of Super <br>Can't you guys even read? Or is that too hard?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean after BotG?</br>  <br>if i was the son of the ox queen i totally would.<br><br>she promised me!</br></br></br>  <br>No, because BotG took place 4-5 years after Buu.<br><br>Yes, this means chapter 1 isnt consistent with BoG. Its Toriyama were talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>BotG is like 4 years after Buu</br>  <br>They aren't going to waste 2 fucking arcs re-doing the 2 movies. No one is that retarded.</br>  <br><br>I'm saying this because it doesn't fit in with Battle of Gods and Fukkatsu no "F". Beerus was asleep for 39 years at the start of BoG, which takes place in Age 778. That means he's been asleep since Age 739. Super takes place 6 months after the fight with Buu, meaning it's still in Age 774. Despite this, it shows Beerus awake, and recounting his dream about a Super Saiyan God. Champa and his attendant are also important characters early on in the story.<br><br>If the first arc of the story is the Battle of Gods arc, and the time frame is 6 months after Buu, then that means it's not just an extended retelling of Battle of Gods. It's most likely a different universe to the movies, which were said to be continuations of the manga.<br><br>I'm including Kai with Super only because Super is following Kai's broadcast and is meant to act as its successor/sequel.<br><br>Nowhere did they say that Super is the seventh universe. They only said that the sixth universe is the neighbor to Super's universe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Just think In on of the universes GT lays to be unlocked.  <br>I guess I'd be ok with that but I'd still like slightly different races, idk, I'd have to think about it.</br>  <br>Dammit. I didn't sit through two movies (which were great) just for them to give us a prequel series. Seriously what the fuck.</br>  <br>YES THEY ARE<br>READ THE GODDAMN ARTICLE<br>BATTLE OF GODS ARC<br>FUKKATSU NO "F" ARC<br>MULTIVERSE BATTLE ARC<br><br><br>I know it's Toriyama, but this seems like a rather huge oversight, even for him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said that, stop putting words in my mouth and actually read the news article</br>  <br><br>If they just make Beerus wait around for 4 years for no particular reason they could still make it 99% the same as the movie.</br></br>  <br>Godku would win that no contest. Super Saiyan 4 is only as strong as Super Vegetto, Godku eclipses Super Saiyan 3 Vegetto.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127423522 <br>When the BD come out<br> tfw Im gonna go watch it tomorrow on my local cinema <br>Enjoy waiting anon</br></br></br>  <br>What if the dream Beerus talked about in the trailer is the entire BotG movie and the real events of the dream take place in the new series?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127423522 <br>Select theaters<br><br><br>Not to get into power level bullshit, but Super Saiyan God is equal to or better than Super Saiyan 4. There was that one article by Toriyama where he explains the working of the Super Saiyan transformations, and that Super Saiyan God basically draws out all latent Super Saiyan potential, removing the need for further transformations as they only serve to consume more energy. This means that Super Saiyan God is at least as strong as Super Saiyan 4 since the latter is just a further transformation. The only disadvantage Super Saiyan God has in comparison is the time limit, but Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan fixes that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That would both be incredibly dumb and incredibly brilliant at the same time.</br>  <br>Thanks for pointing out the obvious. You could of also just say God Goku wins because SSJ4 isn't canon.</br>  <br>Apparently the latest games (Xenoverse and the 3DS game) state that Super Cyan is indeed stronger than any other form, so that's official, if you want to believe it.</br>  <br> equal or better <br>The equal part is a huge exaggeration. That's like saying God Goku is weaker than Omega Shenron, and Omega Shenron is almost as strong if not equal to Beerus which is complete bullshit.</br></br>  <br>How much of a planet buster is godku anyway? For all we know he hasn't fully mastered and unlocked his new forms potential</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127423522 <br> watching subbed dbz </br>  <br>Its far less of a plot hole than Future Gohan being weaker than the Androids after THIRTEEN YEARS of straight fighting while main Gohan became stronger than Perfect Cell after just 1 year of training.</br>  <br>Future Gohan didn't get to train with his dad,that's the problem</br>  <br>you have to remember one important fact: gohan a shit</br>  <br>He does in RoF I believe<br><br>He wasnt stronger than cell because of his training. He just unlocked his inner hidden power that he wasnt capable of mastering throughout his childhood.</br></br></br>  <br>Its 13 years were talking about. In terms of DB training time that might as well be a million. 13 years is AFTER the end of the Buu saga. And he couldnt beat weakened versions of Androids in all that time even though he beat Cell? Yamcha could probably beat them with 13 years of training.</br>  <br>So super cyan goku is god forms full potential?</br>  <br>He was at least around equal with Cell without even going SSJ2.</br>  <br>But it's his dad. Goku knew what he had to do in order to make Gohan stronger. He knew what would bring out his full potential.</br>  <br>Vegeta became stronger than both the Androids just by ignoring Trunks and punching the air a lot.</br>  <br>Not even close. Cell threw him around like a rag doll. Gohan was far less powerful</br>  <br>Only because Gohan wasnt as into it. He was still obviously above the Androids at least.<br><br> defending plot holes <br><br>Just say Toriyama sucks at writing and be done with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pardon my ignorance, but is "super cyan" what SSJGSS is called?</br>  H Y P E<br>Y<br>P<br>E<br><br>thats some major news right there. <br><br>please let people other than goku and vegeta shine that are NOT new characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope they do something with Uub. I want a human that's worth a damn.  <br> please let people other than goku and vegeta shine that are NOT new characters. <br><br>Id be fine with new characters being important if theyre well written. Because lets face it, nobody cares about Yamcha or Chaotzu and that just leaves Piccolo and the other Saiyans who are just less competent copies of Goku.</br></br></br>  <br> and vegeta <br>He never got his chance to shine. If anything, he deserves it more than anyone.</br></br>   yfw toriyama is literally ripping off Dragon Ball Multiverse   <br>I strongly doubt he's ever even heard of it.</br>  <br>I'd rather see Tien, Yamcha, Krillin and maybe even Roshi learn either Kaioken or have Elder Kai unlock their potential.. Or some other new kind of powerup but that might be even more asspulley</br>  <br>I say fuck em.</br>  <br>And completely pointless.<br><br>Wouldn't mind seeing Piccolo do something special since he's the most likeable character on the show.</br></br></br>  <br>no he did it just by screaming while trunks was freaking the fuck out<br><br>...i miss future trunks</br></br></br>  <br>Easily the coolest character in the series. He deserves his own arc</br>  <br>Yeah it's easier to say I guess</br>  <br>DRAGON BALL CONFIRMED UNIVERSE TIER</br>  <br> they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls <br><br>Toriyama actually wrote this unironically.</br></br></br>  <br>They'd still be miles behind Goku and Vegeta for sure, but correct me if I'm wrong.. Humans/Namekians aren't able to go beyond their base forms power? Where as the different SSJ variants have ridiculous multipliers, to have non-saiyans keep up they gotta have something equivalent to those transformations</br>  <br>Theyre gonna wish Beerus and Whis dead.</br>  <br>Always fucking hated how gt/kid trunks hair never curves when he goes SSJ. It goes straight up and looks more like how he would look if he went SSJ2. Fucking love the curve.</br>  <br>Unless there's a super powerful namekian god piccolo can fuse with like kame and Naaaaaaaail</br>  How come they never split senzu beans in half? Seems like an easy way to heal someone useless without wasting a full bean.  <br>Why don't vegeta and goku beat eachother to near death and just have dende constantly heal them so they can be powerful enough to beat any enemy.</br>  <br>Because a power increase of 10,000 wouldnt do a lot against someone with a power level of a billion.<br><br>Vegeta tried it against Frieza and he still couldnt even touch him.</br></br></br>  <br>But they are now stronger, so the power boost would be way higher than that.</br>  <br>That's why I said constantly. If they did it for 6 months straight, imagine how powerful they'd be. They could easily increase their power level by 100k within 10 minutes.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they did at some point. They just implied that it wont completely heal someone unless its a full bean.</br>  <br> Because a power increase of 10,000 <br> implying <br>Goku went from about 150k to several millions. It scales on your current level.</br></br></br>  <br>Blueper Cyan God</br>  Someone made a timeline image already  They aren't actually going to re-do BotG In show from right, guys? That beautiful scene where goku saves the earth from Beerus' blast, and then Beerus raises his arm making it look like he'a about to<br>Finish goku and chooses not to. such an amazing moment. What would be the point...</br>    <br>In show form*</br>  <br><br>Do you even read or watch this series?<br><br>There are no zenkai boosts after super saiyan.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, saiyans can breathe in space now ! </br>  <br>Was it ever stated that they couldn't?</br>  <br>Yes, actually.</br>  <br>In the latest movie Vegeta dies because the earth was destroyed and Frieza survived despite being much weaker than him because he can breathe in space.</br>  <br>Rabbits can live on the moon anyways.</br>  <br>Next time can you not spoil the movie. It's not exactly out here yet.</br>  <br>Goku uses instant transmission to travel throughout space so wouldn't he already have been able to breathe out there? Plus couldn't it be possible his God power allows him to be able to breathe in space also?</br>  <br>Wasn't it confiremd in BoG? Beerus said about other gods of destruction in different universes.<br>Get ready for 10 more series about universes and then movie about every universe untiing versus that boss of all gods of destruction.</br></br>  <br> Goku uses instant transmission to travel throughout space so wouldn't he already have been able to breathe out there? <br><br>When exactly did that occur ?</br></br></br>  <br>Definitely don't expect Gohan to be anything but Yamcha tier and the edginess being pretty much gone. It's gonna be Z Dragon Ball style.</br>  <br>Pretty much any time he goes to King Kai's planet, and even the supreme Kai planet after Buu blew up earth.</br>  <br>I guess God mode does help.</br>  <br>He instant transmissions through space all the time. Buu fight for example, he teleports himself and satan off planet before Buu blew up the earth.</br>  <br>Bardock did it too in the standoff against Frieza</br>  Just finished watching the latino camrip of RoF and I'm hyped as fuck for Super, at what tiime does it air in Japan on Sunday?  <br>Reminder that Broly will be the MC of Universe 6 and will have LSSG.</br>  <br> Broly <br>please no</br></br>  <br>Even though you're baiting, I don't hate the concept of a universe where brolu was never defeated and rampages throughout the universe. Always liked broly.</br>  <br>His fame outshines every other Movie villain, I wouldn't be surprised if he is more known that Beerus. He is always pushed in shit he shouldn't be in. I have seen several game covers where the only non canon character in them is Broly. Just look at the new 3DS game that is coming.</br>  <br>It doesn't mean that it's another dimension with counterparts you know. It's another universe with different characters, races etc.</br>  <br> A universe where Broly has achieved super cyan </br>  <br>No they can't, they never could they can just last longer than a human due to better lung capacity</br>  <br>Instant Transmission is literally teleporting, not actual movement. Its more like moving your body through another plane to get somewhere else really fast</br>  <br><br>What if Universe 6 is FemGokuverse</br></br>  Can anybody else believe how crazy it is this concept of a new series that not even Japan knows what is going to happen?<br><br>This has literally never happened with Dragonball. Every series, movie, OVA, etc. came to other countries much later than when they finished in Japan. All anybody had to do was see a magazine or get a piss yellow subtitled VHS. Even if they tried to guess what would happen, some guy could have that one Japanese friend and they tell them.<br><br>For once in its entire franchise's lifetime, literally everybody will be watching something Dragonball without another country knowing what happens down the line</br></br></br></br>  <br>he died because the fucking planet exploded, not because he couldn't breathe</br>  <br>How much Gohanfags tears can we expect?</br>  <br> i'm born in a time when I can watch any anime at the same time as japan <br> this also applies to dragonball <br> wow,so fucking crazy </br></br></br>  <br>Enough to fill a 10 gallon hat</br>  <br><br>Why do you fags always have to bring up gohan?<br><br>Hea a jobber now and will never ever be relevant again NEVER EVER!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do you fags always have to bring up gohan? <br>Because Gohanfags can't stop bringing him up although he's irrelevant as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Did you watch the movie? Frieza didnt die, and Beerus attributed that thats because can breath in space.</br>  <br>Gohan has been the absolute strongest several times in the past and will continue to overtake everyone else in this new series. Stay delusional vegetafag</br>  <br>So... Wait... What... Will the movies be chopped up and integrated as multipart episodes or will they tell stories that build up into each movie and then just be all "lol plz buy our bluray to see what happens!" and cut to post BotG/"F" arcs?</br>  <br> got rekt by first form freeza </br>  <br> Universe 6.3 </br>  Universe 6. They're all gonna fight their GT counterparts.  <br> fighting moustache leather pants vegeta <br>Oh god the horror</br></br>  <br>God please Toriyama  dont do this. Fat Beerus is lazy enough. </br>  <br> Stay delusional vegetafag </br>  <br>Uhh, okay?</br>  <br><br>Hey, if i had watched the movie yet i could cherry pick the part where Vegeta dies too.<br><br>Face it, Gohan is going to kick ass at one point or another in the new series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was part of Gohans strategy to let Friezas guard down and then Goku came and fucked it up.</br>  <br>So it's GT. Not too bad.</br>  <br> i could cherry pick the part where Vegeta dies too. <br>You mean when the earth gets exploded?</br></br>  <br> cherry pick <br>It's literally the only thing Gohan does in the movie<br>Unless you count him beating Nappa-tier soldiers as proof of him being strong</br></br></br>  <br> That was part of Gohans strategy  <br>Gohan please</br></br>  <br>My balls would go dragon</br>    <br>Its a sound strategy. Stay mad cunt</br>  <br>He was merely pretending<br>Just like Piccolo</br></br>  <br>this is GT all over again</br>  <br/>  Did Frieza call it "Earth's Hell" in the original Japanese audio of RoF too? Because it sounds like he's implying each planet has a different hell and the only reason he went there is because he died on Earth  What are Piccolo's shoes made of?  <br> NEVER EVER! <br>What's a /v/tard doing here crossboarding? GET OUT</br></br>  I haven't followed this since the first PV was announced. Has any new PV stuff come out?  <br><br><br>This meme is almost as bad ad gohan himself</br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel you.</br></br>  <br>Ummm all he does is get his ass kicked. He has 1 moment where he GOTTA GO FAST's some cannon fodder and then gets punched in the dick by first form Freeza</br>  <br><br><br>thanks doc</br></br></br>  <br><br>What Universe is Dragonball Evolution?</br></br>  is there a DB Super PV2 yet?  <br>PR? San Patricio?</br>  <br>Yes, a 30 sec PV and the first episode synopsis</br>   Mfw I watched Revival of F <br><br>Gotta say if Super DB is anything like the movie, then it's gonna be great</br></br>  <br>There's a 15 sec one and a 30 sec one<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/guides/ep<wbr>isode/super/30sec_preview.mp4</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>this one?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=coK<wbr>xF3ROa3c</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>thanks<br><br>ignore this</br></br></br>  It looks bad and the plot seeme built on making as many bullshit stuff you can think of without having to stay consistent.Release two movies and then rework them into a series with slight differences and call it a different universe how convenient. Besides the fact they're re-using Frieza and probably Cell too. Nothing about this seems good except maybe Slice-of-life adventures of Majin Buu  <br> Revival of F <br>Best movie with Fusion Reborn. Fun and crazy DB is best DB.</br></br>  <br> Implying BoG isn't the best movie <br><br><br> and call it a different universe <br>They're not calling the series a different universe, they are going to different universes as established in BoG. At least keep up with the information</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Revival of F <br> fun <br>when</br></br></br>  <br>BoG pacing is in the toilet most of the time.</br>  So Super's going to be 150+ episodes, right?  <br>Will Yamcha be competent in one of the universes?</br>  <br><br>Shit Verse</br></br>  Would they change Goku's jap voice since leldifferent universe?  <br>Where does Kid Buu stack up against Beerus in power. Beerus obviously smacked Mr. Buu around, but so did Kid Buu. It stands to reason that if Goku will eventually overcome Beerus in strength (which he in all likelihood will), Uub wouldn't really seem all that tough to him. <br><br>This is exciting though. The multiverse angle opens up all kinds of possibilities, like canon characters fighting non-canon characters like Broly or Omega Shenron. I wonder what happens if a Goku from one universe does a Fusion with a Goku from another.</br></br></br>   Fat Beerus <br>The mantitty game is strong</br>  <br>I think it's been said to be 100-200 episodes.</br>  <br>It's not set in a different universe. The final arc of Super has the characters travelling to Universe 6.</br>  <br> The final arc of Super has the characters travelling to Universe 6. <br> final arc </br></br>  <br>But she won't have anything hard down there.</br>  <br>I hope for no Namek.</br>  <br> namekians are now just the asari <br>I like this</br></br>  <br>Man I'm content where dbz ended I probably won't watch this</br>  <br>I expected Tori to completely forget the multiverse thing.<br>Bravo, maybe he isn't completely senile.</br></br>  <br>Something like this?</br>   inb4 a universe with humans having transformations <br><br> this picture was made in 2009. </br></br>  <br><br>Youre a terrible artist</br></br>  <br> implying that's mine <br><br>If I did draw it, I wouldn't have Videl in it.</br></br></br>   SSJ4 exists in another universe <br>  SSJ4 Goku fucks God Goku up </br>      So what's the name of this "female Whis" anyway?    <br>Other way around. Monkey Trouble can't even hope to come anywhere near God-tier.</br>  So can I watch Dragon Ball Super without "revival of f", or should wait for it? Can I watch it somewhere on internet, or not?  How the hell do you go to war with an entirely different universe?  <br>When your cat gods get in a shouting contest <br/></br>  So basically the first few episodes of Super will be SoL episodes after Buu, then a retelling of BotG and RoF for people who didn't watch the movies, and then jump into the Universe 6 arc?<br><br>Sounds good I guess I just hope it's not full on GT and all the new characters are fuck ugly alien shits</br></br>  <br>I don't know about SoL.The first chapter of the manga goes straight to Beerus by page 10.</br>  <br>But wasn't it announced that the first storyline would be goten getting Gohan a wedding gift?</br>  Reminder that Jheese did nothing wrong<br>Reminder that Jheese is the best Ginyu<br>Reminder that Jheese deserved better</br></br>  I wonder if the universes will be more unique or will we have an Infinite Crisis situation with alternate versions of the same characters.  <br>It's just an excuse to include  Red Cell </br>   female whis <br>YES<br> no female beerus <br>TORIYAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br></br></br>  What would happen if Goku and Beerus fused?  <br><br>He'd be weaker than Vegito.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>If the Saiyans are still around, I foresee Vegeta getting into an ego match with this universe's Saiyan prince.</br>  <br>Can't wait to meet girl Goku.</br>  <br><br> genderbent whis <br>....muh dick</br></br></br>  <br> people keeps loving this shitty lazy designs </br>  <br> videl suddenly cant fly </br>  <br>Moeshit pandering.</br>  <br>you people will complain about ANYTHING<br><br>I bet you think Chi-chi and Bulma are flying in that poster too, and Goku and Vegeta are giants</br></br></br>  <br>Are you talkin' Potara? Cuz Beerus would have to be able to lower his powerlevel a shit ton while Goku was in his super saiyan god form.</br>  <br>Is think Gohan carrying Videl doesn't mean she can't fly anymore as much as she probably can't fly as fast or as well as Gohan.</br>  <br>impossible. Gohan can barely even go SS anymore.</br>  <br> expecting Toriyama to be this creatove </br>  <br> liking funnysexydragonball horrendous art </br>  <br> Gohan can barely even go SS anymore. <br>Absolutely hilarious.</br></br>  <br> implying every universe won't be just a variation of Beerus and Whis </br>  <br>if vegeta gets mad, he rapes godku and beerus easily</br>  <br>Yeah but he probably flies more often than he powers up to Super saiyan. Flying's probably 2nd nature to him like walking or taking a shit. Turning super saiyan is strictly a combat thing.</br>  <br><br> you now realize vegeta received gohans gimmick of being super strong when mad <br><br>how much harder can gohan be cucked?</br></br></br></br>  <br>it you mean "gets a few hits in and then gets slapped to the ground like the bitch he is" then yes</br>  <br>videl is gonna fuck universe 6 gohan<br>he's gonna get cucked by himself</br></br>  How did we go from this  to this?  <br>most girls enter bitch mode at her age</br>  <br>Universe 7 Gohan is fodder. Lets hope for gohan fans that universe 6 gohan is still a baddass.</br>  <br>puberty and the fact she is the grandaughter of the two most famous heroes on earth.</br>  <br>Goten please don't end up like Gohan</br>  Sorry to say, but DBZ started irredeemably sucking at the Cell saga. Dragonball is fantastic, the Freiza saga is decent, and even those few episodes that came out when Goku was out of the picture were good. But the only thing to happen past that point was the Trunks from the Future movie  <br> SS4GSS </br>  Predictions? <br><br> It won't be alternate universes like as far as a "new goku" or something like that.. but races could be the same <br> Whis' race are rulers of the multiverse, and are tyrants  <br> King of multiverse will be the final boss </br></br></br></br>  <br> they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls <br>For what reason</br></br>  <br>Whis' race probably created purple space cats and maijins to be Satans for them</br>  <br>and majin buu is getting reabsorbed by the big bad guy triggering the SSGFSS3GF</br>  <br>You're forgetting the push-ups, sit-ups, and plenty of orange juice.</br>  <br>and in said universe, girl Goku brushes girl Raditz' hair like in that one image</br>  <br>I need it.</br>  <br> we will soon have DBS threads infested with fujos </br>  <br>I thought it was a popular image.<br><br>In said image, Goku and Raditz are drawn with K-on style faces and obviously they're little girls.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, they are going for the fujos<br><br>ib RoF goku needs to teleport with vegeta to go to the earth, and goku says something like<br><br> vegeta give me your hand <br> K-kakkarot i- don't wanna <br> if you don't do it bulma might get hurt <br> O-ok k-kakarot o-nly this time <br> then they hold hand in the gayest way possible <br><br>that was funny</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if instead of jumping through time Trunks was jumping through universes.  <br>What if we don't.</br>  <br>that was literally what he was doing<br>they even explained it and demonstrate it more than once</br></br>  <br>Do they use a new teleportation technique?<br>Goku doesn't have to hold hands to instant transmission.<br>Sounds adorable though.</br></br></br>  I'm starting to realize this will be even worse than GT  <br>I need that webm.</br>  <br>Goku did that during the Saiyan saga. He only had one left so he gave Krillin and Gohan one half each.</br>  What's the biggest bullshit plot bandaid?<br> ZENKAI <br> senzu beans </br></br>  <br><br>Changing the way the Dragonballs work on a dime.<br><br> "Oh yeah I changed them to two wishes, was easy no problem" </br></br></br></br>   obligatory universe collide episode with Z, Super, and GT all teaming up to take down ancient evil   <br>Is this for real?<br>Oh wow!<br>Super Sayan God Super Sayan Gohan incoming</br></br></br>  I really hope Goku and Vegeta surpass Beerus/Whis by the end of Super. The child in me will not be satisfied until they are the most powerful beings in DB.  <br>probably they will fuck each other</br>  Will universe six be populated mostly by cute little girls?  <br>Heheh.</br>  <br> implying Toei acknowledges GT in 2015 </br>  <br>Really. Cuz the child in me won't be satisfied unless there's always someone stronger than Goku, since that was kind of the whole point of everything.</br>  <br> The child in me will not be satisfied until they are the most powerful beings in DB. <br><br>They were never really the most powerful past Freeza saga.</br></br></br>    Spoilers out, Sabo refuses to finish off Burgess, Burgess bt- oh wait, I forgot, I'm over 18.  <br>She's literally the definition of a fanservice character (though I do admit it's cute).</br>  <br>because she's a complete counterexample to your entire argument?<br>Okay, we'll leave her out then.</br></br>  <br> everyone who replies to my posts must be the same person I was talking to before </br>  <br> got Luffy into ID <br> told Ace about Luffy <br> got Luffy Ace's handcuff's key <br> saved Luffy after MF <br> protected Luffy during timeskip by hiding him away <br> helped him set sail right after TS <br> will probably help again in future if not show up to fight alongside him <br><br>Total fanservice tier 0/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You really didn't get that I was on your side here? The whole "because, period" bit didn't clue you in?</br>  How hard will it be to resist fapping to Mikan this season, /a/?  <br>Easy as fuck because I prefer fapping to  Haruna-chan </br>  I'll wait for BD first.  impossible. she's so fucking hot  I only fap to Mikan if she's drawn by Yabuki or Ishikei.  Can't wait for more delicious Mikan doujins    <br>Haruna is the worst girl. But she is still great. The other ones are just superior. <br> Nana a best. </br></br>  By next week everyone will have failed  <br>Pretty easy, I don't follow the awful Xebec adaptations</br>   expecting Mikan-service in the anime   <br>I already failed 4 times in the past 2 days.</br>  Spoilers for chap 57 out yet ?  <br>Hard as diamond if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>I have no cum left for Mikan : I've already fapped to  Nemesis </br>  Nemesis was added to the website.<br><br>http://www.j-toloveru.com/character<wbr>/nemesis.html</wbr></br></br>  <br> resist <br>Why contain it?</br></br>  Why is this allowed?    <br>only the magazine cover so far, but you probably have seen that already</br>  <br>Yep I've seen it.

Momo is the reason for me picking up the series, Nana is the reason I'm still here  <br>Tomorrow at earliest</br>  <br>Damn.

My Wife is the Student Council President! stars Izumi Hayato (Okitsu Kazuyuki), who is running for student council president. But when the beautiful Wakana Ui (Taketatsu Ayana) swoops in, promising the liberalization of love and throwing condoms into the audience, Izumi loses and ends up as her vice president. If that wasn’t enough, the newly-elected president ends up inviting herself over to Izumi’s house, and announces that she’s Izumi’s wife, thanks to an agreement—facilitated by alcohol—that their parents made when they were three. Each episode will be ten minutes long.  Ergastulum is a city of petty thieves and powerful mafia families, of sex workers and corrupt cops. It’s a city that casts a grimy shadow over the actions of its citizens, hiding the dirty nature that lies beneath. The streets of Ergastulum are ruled by four gangs: Paulklee, Corsica, Monroe, and Cristiano. Nicolas Brown (Tsuda Kenjirou) and Worwick Arcangelo (Suwabe Junichi) are two jacks-of-all-trades, dealing with the tasks that no one else dares to tackle in this dangerous urban jungle. But this powerful duo find themselves in trouble after they’re asked to deal with a new gang making waves in the territory of one of the top mafia families. Things are never as they seem in the dark alleys of Ergastulum, but this case may be one even they can’t handle.  <br> From the original creator of Chu-Bra!! <br><br>An introduction like that screams irrelevant</br></br></br>  Seems like it'd be easier to list what I'm not going to watch this season:<br>Kaijuu<br>Makura<br>Junjou<br>Hetalia<br>Oh and Dragon Ball.<br><br>On the fence about Million Doll and Venus Project but fuck it, I guess I'll try them as well.<br>So yeah. Shit. That's a lot of shows picked up but it seems like six or seven shows will get dropped like usual.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At that point you might as well pick up those five so you can brag about watching everything on /a/</br>  <br>Each episode would take only 10 min. of your life.</br>  <br>That's ten whole shitposts though</br>  <br>Nah man. There are some things even I can't stomach. Besides, what am I supposed to brag? How infallibly shit my tastes are and how much of a life I lack? I guess you could call that an achievement.</br>  Anyone here read the Gansta manga/novel or whatever? Is it any good? The premise is interesting I guess. I'll keep my eye on it.<br><br>Other than that there's nothing for me on this list right now.</br></br>  <br> How infallibly shit my tastes are and how much of a life I lack <br><br>Isn't that the entire point of this board?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's shit</br></br>  <br> Gansta manga <br>it's good and has 0 fjoshit bait.</br></br>  Bikini Warriors, nothing else.  <br><br>This is why you don't ask /a/ for opinions</br></br>  <br>No need to be an insufferable fuck about it, I always say.

I'm impressed.</br>  In order of hype:<br>Gakkou gurashi, NNB, Prison school, Working, Ushio x Tora, Overlord</br>   4 or so shows I want to watch as season starts <br> browse /a/ during the season <br> get caught up in the hype of about another 6-10 shows that deep down I know will be shit <br> download them <br> think they're shit but have potential <br> watch all 24 episodes and they turned out to be shit <br> be disappointed in myself <br> repeat <br><br>Every season without fail. At the moment I know I'm going to watch NNB2, Working 3, Gangsta and Prison School.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's coming out today? And will we get subs within 5 hours?</br>  <br>If you want shit Funi rips then yes.</br>  <br>Gangsta and some student council thing<br><br>Gangsta is picked up by funi so subs should be immediate</br></br></br>   new season <br> pick up around 5 shows <br> after a few weeks I start to slack and the episodes pile up <br> end up not finishing anything <br><br>Every fucking season. <br><br> T-this season will be different right? ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no need to be an insufferable dick <br><br>What the fuck is this? A reasonable individual?<br>Where am I?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bizzaro /a/</br>  People should really get some fucking patience and wait a few week so you don't have to go trough that shitty period where nobody knows what groups will pick up and actually complete a series.  <br>Must have slipped into bizzaro /a/ again. Get out of there before it's too late.</br>  <br> 26 <br><br>I usually get 12 every season and I think it's a lot. I don't drop them unless it's really awful, though.</br></br></br>  <br> 26 <br>M8, get another hobby besides animu.</br></br>  Very hyped for Symphogear GX, Classroom Crisis, Wizard Air Academy (Kusen Madoushi) and Venus Project. Will watch most of the rest although I have very little expectations for them.  The Seiyu show looks different, I'll try that. Also, isn't monster girl airing this season?  No one is simulcasting Okusama ga Seito Kaichou right?  <br> isn't monster girl airing this season? <br><br>Yes</br></br></br>  Is Gate good or is it just for /ak/ autists?  <br>Relatively hype tier: Gate, Gods Eater.<br>The manga was better tier: Monster Musume, Kangoku Gakuen.<br>Sound promising tier: Joukamachi no Dantelion, Gakkou Gurashi, Chaos Dragon</br></br></br>  Shit I still haven't seen Symphogear and Working  <br><br>For pedo autists too</br></br>   Shimoseka <br> Prison school <br> Gangsta <br>Most "hyped for"<br><br> Jitsu Wa  <br> Charlotte <br> Overlord <br>I'll have a look at<br><br><br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Well here goes nothing<br><br> Ore Monogatari <br> SnS <br> Baby Steps <br>Will continie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God tier:<br>Miss monochrome<br><br>Must watch:<br>Drrr!x2 <br>Himouto!

How could he possibly do anything other than watch anime with such a time consuming amount!</br>  From the chart it seem I'll only thoroughly enjoy DETERMINATION TO FIST<br><br> For the rest, I'll give them 12-episode rule </br></br>  <br>    12-episode rule <br>top kek</br></br>  <br>Well considering a significant amount of anime is 13 episodes or 2 cour it isn't that silly</br>  <br> symphoshit <br>fuck off with your shit taste</br></br>  <br><br> Shimoseka <br>Why would you be hyped for ecchi LN shit by JC Staff?</br></br></br>  <br>Hyped and "Hyped" are very different things.<br>The premise sounds fun</br></br>  <br>Please dont post with reaction image from good show, when you obviously have shit taste. Symphogear is officially one of the worst anime franchizes ever made.</br>  <br> watching a series even if it's complete shit for at the very least 12 episodes <br>Anon, I...</br></br>  <br>fuck you.Symphogear is fun</br>  <br>If its /a/ threads are fun, its worth it. Watching anime is totally not worth it anyway. The joy of anime is 30% the show itself, 20% hype on /a/ and 50% shitposting</br>  <br>Yeah LNs are super interesting and unique and totally not generic</br>  <br>Why not? I've missed really trashy ecchi comedy shows since Nourin.</br>  <br>Again, the synopsis sounds fun.<br>Chill out</br></br>  <br>It's not a rule I have, just saying it could be plausible<br><br>The second last episode sets up the finale. If you can tell that it is just going to be shit, you can drop it then. It also marks the midway point of a 2 cour. You've seen half a season, you know what to expect now. It's a sensible dropping point.<br><br>Personally I just choose shows selectively and never drop them if I pick them up.</br></br></br></br></br>   Ctrl F Wakaba <br>  0 results  <br><br>Surely I'm not the only one interested in this? I mean it doesn't seems like the most original show ever but could make up for a decent SOL nonetheless. Also the main girl obsession with gyaru got me curious.</br></br></br>  <br> It's a sensible dropping point. <br> wasting all the time instead of watching 3-6(max) and know that it's shit or not <br>anon pls</br></br></br>  <br>Just go watch B Gata H key, its better</br>  <br>It just sounds boring to me. I enjoy SOL, but I like it to have at least some kind of quirk.<br><br><br>Sometimes shows start off strongly and then die down. Ore Monogatari is a decent example. it started strong but grew stale. If I was into dropping things I would probably drop it now.</br></br></br></br>  NNB x2<br>Himouto<br>Gangsta<br><br> maybe <br>overlord<br><br> stuff I'm behind but I'd watch <br>prisma loli<br>to love ru</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people seriously listing Gangsta among the shows they look forward to watch <br>heh, ignorant plebs. Will be fun watching everyone drop it.</br>  When the fuck are we getting the Mushishi movie? It's summer.  <br>I usually try to pick up 7-8 and end up watching 3 and change. Last season I just watched all of Nanoha and ViviD instead, plus Fate and Danna. Everything else was varying shades of "manga was better" and shit.</br>  <br> Will be fun watching everyone drop it. <br><br>yeah just like this season first 3 weeks of ninja slayer DOMO DOMO DOMO, right?<br><br>sure was fun being littered with YEART until everyone dropped it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have shittaste <br>Well, that's kind of your problem.</br></br>    <br><br>I don't watch anime shorts.</br></br>  <br>It's a short</br>  <br> kek <br/></br>  <br>People actually liked Kekkai Sensen,so i bet there will be people claiming Gangsta is AOTS after Summer season.<br><br>The Gangsta manga is really disappointing,so be warned /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>Ninja Slayer, initial Inferno Cop shock aside, turned out to be quite decent - and while Trigger drones shut up, it has plenty of people who enjoy it.<br><br>Gangsta is just shit.<br><br><br>No, i can read source material and dont just blindly jump on hype train based on visuals alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's shit I'll drop it like any other show in any other season, that's how it works.</br>  <br>I sure didn't expect Umaru Chan to be animed.<br>I look forward as how they are going to not turn Prison School in a weird fetish porno.<br>Monster Musume, I'm really excited about this.<br>To love-ru, Mikan fap material back.<br>As for Kaleid, I want to see  Mini Gil </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> heh, ignorant plebs. <br><br><br> Ninja Slayer turned out to be quite decent </br></br></br></br>  <br> No, i can read source material <br>I read it to and you have shittaste. You're probably hating on it, because it's neither a shonen nor a moe show, although manlet is too moe.

And I suppose Working 3 will be watchable at least. I expect those two to not suck.<br><br>Charlotte (plot seems reminiscent of Shin sekai yori), Classroom crisis, I expect to suck, but will check out anyway.<br><br>An annoying trend in anime these days is starting shows off with snore-inducing SoL bullshit for weeks on end. As if they think it enamors you to the characters, heightens the drama, or something.

I can just picture /as collective brain imploding in on itself trying to parse an answer to this question. I figure people will default to the Maeda choice. Let's read the thread and see if I'm right.</br></br>  <br><br>Literally the only reason people care. That gimmick will likely where out anything it has going for it like five minutes into the first episode when people realize it doesn't fucking mean anything as far as the show goes which they should have realized already. Like seriously even if you're the biggest Gen and Nasu fanboy in the world how is the fact that they came up with some ideas for characters the show is barely even using supposed to carry anything for 3 months.</br></br>  <br><br>And both are Aniplex projects by Visual Novel authors which is something they've just had such a great track record with lately. Pretty sad really.</br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with Funi, how about supporting the fucking industry for once?</br>  This season is looking way better than last seasons. Gonna pick up a bunch of shows.  <br> implying Classroom Crisis won't be great </br>  <br><br>Love Live has already won it.</br></br>  <br>Gakkou Gurashi looks really cute.</br>  <br> Nothing wrong with Funi <br>Really now?</br></br>  <br>If I wanted to give money to the industry I would give it to someone that is doing it's work right</br>  <br>Yeah, really. Funimation is the shit, people should give them a chance and, you know, SUPPORT their own fucking hobby? Instead of going to fansub groups just because of "oh, my karaoke! Oh, my softsubs!" Support more anime being brought to mainstream attention, this isn't the 90's.</br>  <br> Illy <br>Wokring!!!, Illya, nothing else</br></br>  <br>I can't stand all the bait I've seen around /a/ these days.<br><br>I'll quit /a/ until the shows I like start airing</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't fucking bait, its just a fucking fact. They come out before fansubs AND support the industry AND also have broadcast dubs too!</br>  <br>And they look like shit. Would give my money to Crunchyroll everytime</br>  <br>Not really, and funi has tons that crunchyroll doesnt</br>  <br>If they wouldn't at least stream in that shit quality. I know you can't see since you're watching on your little laptop.<br>And if you want to support the industry buy BD, figures and other kind of merchandise. You don't support the industry by buying shitty streaming subscriptions, you only act as a decoy so Japan doesn't shit on you for pirating again.</br></br>  <br>I watch on a tablet, and why would I pay for overpriced BD/LN/Manga I can't understand?</br>  Only Symphogear. I might also watch the VN author tabletop thing and Prisma Illya  Good story, good art, good characters, no good  scans.<br><br>;_;</br></br>   Takeuchi: "This will surpass UBW"<br><br>Can't wait.<br><br>http://otakomu.jp/archives/273516.h<wbr>tml</wbr></br></br></br></br>  This is going to be shit then. How sad.  <br>Because Heaven's Feel has always been better than UBW.</br>  <br> "This will surpass UBW" <br>Just like every sequel announced ?</br></br>  <br> Takeuchi <br> UBW not enough Seiba time <br> HF has more Seiba time <br>inb4 ending is Last Episode</br></br></br></br>  How many movies?  <br>So that's the new logo? Looks nice. The purple is a better color than red honestly.</br>  Is he really saying it'll surpass it? Google's just giving me that if you like UBW, you'll really like this.    <br> new logo <br>Not as new as you.</br></br>  <br><br>If they do Fate Route, will the logo be blue?</br></br>  <br>I heard it was going to be 2 movies.</br>  <br>I want an extra movie just for the cooking.</br>  <br>Probably brown.</br>  <br>What if you like Zero but dislike UBW?</br>  <br>HF might be more your thing. Zero stole a lot from HF. Though HF is by far the most divisive route in the story, and a lot of it depends on how you like Shirou characterized, and if you can enjoy Sakura's characterization.</br>  <br>I meant for the HF route. I know they changed it when they announced UBW and I couldn't find it on the HF site or in the trailer.</br>  <br>The route does a better follow up to Zero.<br>Has Rin and Sakura as relevant characters with their family stuff, goes back to the black grail and the real dangers of the war, Shirou considering Kiritsugu's ideals...</br></br>  Can UBW keep up with him?  <br>The thing about HF though is that it basically throws the grail war concept out the window, including treating characters like Gil like nothing.<br><br>It's not exactly the battle royale story some Zero fans might expect.</br></br></br>  <br>UBW Shirou already surpassed him.</br>  <br>Zero wasn't a battle royale half of it anyway. The halfway point is servants joining to take on a bigger monster.<br> treating characters like Gil like nothing. <br>At least he survives almost the whole war..</br></br></br>  <br>and instead of getting a happy resolution to Saber's dilemma you see her corrupted and getting the bad end. Kirei v Shirou mirroring Kiritsugu, the only thing is Gil not being as relevant but other than that it's the best complement to Zero</br>  <br>good shit this shit is movie. hopefully not as much circlejerk as ubw</br>  <br>Zerofags proving themselves to be retards once again.<br><br>You retards don't even know the definition of battle royale.<br><br>Zero was overwhelmingly duels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except this isn't a sequel. This is an improvement.</br>  <br>The thing is, I see Zero people going on a lot about how it felt like a "real" war. You're not really gonna get that at all in HF.<br><br>And Gil only shows up for a couple of scenes only. He's UBW Kirei in that sense.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a Zerofag, but those are the terms they like to throw around.<br><br>Atmospherically, HF is closer to Zero, but it's not really a sequel in that sense. Most of the servants get thrown out entirely.</br></br></br>  <br>They could always give him one pity battle against the shadow that feels more like a battle, before surprisingly getting eating by Sakura.</br>  <br> He's UBW Kirei in that sense. <br>All the servants are in UBW. If anything surprises Zerofags, it'll be that almost all the servants go down for the count early and it ends up being Sakura and Zouken against the remaining masters.</br></br>  <br> This will surpass UBW <br><br>no it's not <br>can you read it before saying?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me, why couldn't Ufo just adapt HF as a 2 cour anime instead, and make UBW into the movie? Since the Zero anime is practically the HF sequel anyway.</br>  <br>I know it's not a sequel, I'm merely saying that that's basically what the developers/authors say to hype up people.</br>  <br>Because that would have made sense, HF had content to be adapted into 24 episodes without stretching stuff.<br>They could have even fixed the pacing of the three days before the last three because that's the real deadly part of HF.</br></br>  <br>they won't care about their "real war" when they see the kirei and shirou fighting. That scene will MAKE that movie.</br>  <br>Lots of fucking reasons.<br><br>1. UBW had a movie. It was a terrible. So terrible that Type Moon doesn't recognize it exists. It needed an apology<br>2. HF works off of the foundations of the previous routes and twisting things in them. You don't have the stuff to twist, you don't have the proper story.<br>3. Censorship. HF would just not work well on TV.<br>4. People would complain about a squid killing all ther servants. UBW gives most of the servants at least something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it simply because UBW is more popular?</br></br>  <br>Is Takeuchi actually saying it's gonna surpass UBW, or is OP bullshitting?</br>  <br>They wont need their Hill of Swords once they see Nine Lives Blade Works.<br><br>Zerofags also get to see Kirei unleash his Black keys in combat.</br></br></br>  <br>Think its OP bullshitting.<br><br>Just go to OP's link. <br><br>I don't see the Japanese word for surpass anywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Two dead people beating each other up and an attack that canonically lasts a few seconds is gonna make people go crazy?</br></br>  <br> squid killing the servants. <br><br>People are going to go 'So deep so profound' like the edgelords they are</br></br></br>  <br>Of course it will.</br>  <br> Nine Lives Blade Works <br>Just you wait, everyone will complain how "shitty it was" because no matter what it won't live up to the hype people have for that thing. Every single on of you.</br></br>  <br>HF is better than UBW so that is natural</br>  <br>NLBW is good because it's hyped up through inner monologue. It literally lasts a few seconds in the real world.</br>  <br>OP is clickbaiting you. All the article amounts to is him saying look forward to it. There's no new information.</br>   People falling for OP's bait   <br>takuechi or nasu would never say that OP is probably a wormslutfag also this <br><br>why should we give a shit about secondaries?</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou vs Gil airs <br> Everyone in the Livestream is hyped that UBW is working just like it's supposed to, praising how they got it right, the swords are coming out of the ground and clashing with Gil's, tons of hype <br> Few minutes later <br> Cookingpriest brigade is whining and bitching that it still wasn't good enough <br>Good thing all the secondaries and a bunch of less autistic TM fans liked the fight.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Takeuchi: "This will surpass UBW" <br>That's not going to be hard.</br></br>  <br> not using this. </br>  <br>Because the conversation right now is about secondaries in the first place?</br>  I thought I wouldn't have to see anymore threads of this goddamn franchise after the anime ended  <br>That happens pretty much every episode.</br>  <br> Takeuchi: "This will surpass UBW" <br> Can't wait. <br>If he's saying that I have two predictions<br>A) They're throwing a shit tone of cash at this project and sparing no expenses when it comes to staff.<br>And<br>B) This shit is gonna be fucking amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If he's saying that <br>Well he isn't</br></br>  <br>Tough luck, buddy.<br>Prisma is just around the corner, there is always something, the ride never ends.</br></br>  <br>/a/ is also /type moon/. There were like, 10 threads up earlier. There still might be.</br>  <br>Not that difficult given how they fucked up a lot in 2nd cour.<br><br>I liked ep13, 20, 24 and 25. I still liked it, but i know this could've delivered a lot more.</br></br></br>  Yet another dead lancer.  <br>I don't really think they fucked up the second cour. 20, 24, and 25 are by far the best in the series, and if you can say that, how can you say the second half was bad? 17 was also great. Fuck me Gae Bolg vs Rho Aias will look beautiful on the BDs.<br><br>I also enjoyed the anime original stuff in 14, and in hindsight, with the epilogue existing now, I don't really hate episode 22.</br></br></br>  <br>How much did UBW sell again?<br>Pretty much set in stone that Aniplex is going to throw money at them again.</br></br>  <br>We've been discussing this here before you even got into anime, fucking nerd. Now join or leave.</br>  <br>The Illya episode was all fucked up. For VN readers, it was great because it added info, but they'd have added info in Acht instead of fucking AM Iri, what the fuck was that.</br>  Takeuchi: "Fate was a mistake"  I forgot, how did they find out that Archer is Shirou in HF?<br><br>I remember that it was just a side remark in HF, so I don't remember exactly when they found out.</br></br>  <br> what the fuck was that. <br>Nasu's idea</br></br>  <br>Ilya knew when she absorbed Archer.<br>Shirou knew when he became more conscious of his arm.<br>Rin guessed it by some of Shirou and Ilya's remarks, she talked to Ilya the night before the end.</br></br></br>  <br>15 to me was just kind of "good". They needed to do something with Ilya because they didn't have the Fate route, so they kind of tried to connect stuff through Zero to gain sympathy. It was sort of a compromise.<br><br>Best parts were the fight with Berserker, and Shirou's reaction.</br></br></br>  <br> how did they find out that Archer is Shirou in HF? <br>They don't</br></br>  Takeuchi: "Give me all your money!"  <br>They didn't find out, only Illya knew.</br>  <br>Tohsaka still has the pendant, and so does Shirou in the scene where they access Illya's memories to recreate the jewel sword, Also, he has the guy's arm so that's kind of a give away.</br>  Takeuchi: "HF is going to be a disaster. Stay tuned for Fate"  <br> Takeuchi: "This will surpass UBW" <br>UBW was already surpassed by several anime this season, it's not going to be hard</br></br>  Takeuchi: "Saber's shit. Rin 4lyfe"  <br>That connection to Zero really fucking ruined the episode for me. It wasn't necessary at all.<br><br>And they didn't show Illya suffering enough, call me a monster, but that wasn't enough.</br></br></br>  <br>It's called TV regulations</br>  <br>Like, from a meta standpoint, it kind of was.<br><br>The thing is, Ilya's death in UBW works because it's shocking to see this character who you knew in the Fate route, just get brutalized and die pathetically. The problem though is that the Fate route didn't exist in Ufotable's little bubble, so what could they do?<br><br>They used the fact that Ilya was a character in Zero, and expanded on her through that. Was it optimal? Probably not, but it was likely the best they could do given the circumstances.</br></br></br></br></br>  Heaven's Feel is the new Kizu.<br><br>ufo is doing God Eater, and they will also work in Tales. ufo is a small studio, there's no fucking way the movie will be out this or next year.<br><br>Sakurafags, you're fucking done for.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't care when it's released, as long as it's good. The manga will keep me occupied until then.</br>  <br>How many chapters do you think they'll stop at and let the movie continue?</br>  There won't be any new about HF for the rest of this year. They're just mentioning it so everyone knows They're still working on it. Everything will be quite until next TM Ace then, Sakura cover and a definitive release date.<br><br>Call me a prophet.</br></br>  <br> Sakurafags <br><br>As a Rinfag, I say HF is the best route</br></br></br>   UBW/HF announced <br> HFfags go on saying UBW is just there to hype up HF <br> Weeks of daily senpai threads <br> An entire year goes by without /any/ HF news <br> UBW's ending was written to divorce itself from having to connect to HF entirely <br><br>Meanwhile Ufotable's scrambling to get their shit together with other projects. We don't even know if there's even gonna be more than one movie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want them to take their time with it so I don't mind.</br>  <br> Heaven's Feel is the new Kizu. <br><br>Isn't Girls work ufo's Kizu?</br></br></br>  <br>It's beautiful</br>  <br>And the Tsukihime remake</br>  WHO THE FUCK IS THIS GUY.  <br>Let's not forget Ufotable tactically removed almost every connection to Sakura Rin had in the latter half of the anime. You know the RN scene that has Shirou looking through Rin's memories? It references Sakura in the VN, and the movie actually showed her face. Ufotable cut that.<br><br>They also cut almost every part about how saving Shinji was for Sakura sans a single line in episode 23.</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that not everything needs to be some sort of a reference, right?</br>    <br> They also cut almost every part about how saving Shinji was for Sakura sans a single line in episode 23. <br>That was actually a mistranslation. We all know Rin was apologizing to Sakura for not being able to save Shinji, but Aniplex made it look like she was apologizing to Shinji, and that doesn't make any fucking sense. Rin tried to save Shinji for Shirou and Sakura, not for the sake of saving that fucking asshole.</br></br>  <br>WHY IS HE THE ONLY CHARACTER WITH KARA NO KYOUKAI DESIGN<br><br>THIS SHIT IS BLOWING MY MIND</br></br></br>  <br>Was it an actual mistranslation or just Ufotable removing that connection?</br>  <br>Mistranslation.<br> And I should apologize to you too... <br> I couldn't save... Shinji... </br></br></br>  <br>I hadn't noticed the noze.</br>   "well, might as well go to the UBW event, it's only 45 after all" <br> check site <br> every good seat already taken <br> only shit seats at the fucking back of everything <br> mfw <br><br>Holy fuck why is Fate so popular now. That hall is fucking huge and it's almost sold out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking hate it, TYPE MOON was not supposed to be this popular, it was all better pre ufo's anime adaptions. Now it's all about fucking secondaries.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Saber has less than half the screen time in HF that she did in UBW. Alter's great and all, but she only has two scenes.</br>  <br>I'd rather shoot myself than drive to LA on the 4th of July.</br>  <br>Will it also surpass Gundam?</br>  <br>He's not saying it'll surpass anything. OP's just a lying manipulative worm.</br>  <br>Less than Zero. Around 35k.</br>  <br>UBW was shit so it's setting the bar low.</br>  <br>You know, that's pretty good considering how recent the movie was.</br>  <br>a route to suprass UBW?</br>  <br>I want that, Whatever is that</br>  <br>It's not actually quoted anywhere in the article.<br><br>The only way HF will ever be anything more than a footnote is if it goes full KnK.</br></br></br>  Reminder Shirou and Rin didn't last a decade.  <br>They lasted a century? Eternity?</br>   Ayaka and Arthuria <br> Bazett and Medusa <br> Shirou and Mordred <br> Sakura and Arthuria <br> Waver and Astolfo <br> Tokiomi and Emiya <br> Kirei and Arthur <br><br>MUH DICK</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What exactly is this?</br>  <br>Fun stuff.</br>  <br> &gt;HF has more Seiba time </br>  <br><br><br>And why is there 3 Arthurs?</br></br></br>  <br>Takeuchi is a hack.</br>  <br> Shirou and Mordred <br><br>I like this idea.</br></br></br>  <br>They break up before she goes to destroy the Great Grail with Waver.</br>  I am still under the belief Ufotable's long term goal was to do HF when they started their Fate projects in 2010. Wouldn't be surprised if they started in 2008/2009<br><br>F/Z was their inital project to see how well they could handle F/SN as it is much harder to animate.</br></br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Resistance is futile.</br>  <br> Bazett and Medusa <br>Whats the point? Will she be able to buff Bazett past what Bazett can already do?</br></br>  <br>Takeuchi didn't draw this.</br>  <br>Yes anon, we heard your pitch for your fanfiction last night. Just because Shirou wasn't supposed to meet Waver (which, you know, actually happens now), doesn't mean anything bad happens to Shirou and Rin.</br>  <br> Tokiomi and Emiya <br> not Kiritsugu and Emiya <br>Wasted oppourtunity</br></br></br>  <br>Harry Potter</br>  <br>New manga or something?</br>  <br>Already been drawn, I believe.</br>  <br>Is Shirou going to fuck Mordred too?</br>    <br>Someone should replace Shirou with Takeuchi.</br>  <br> Waver summons Astolfo <br> He teaches him how to be a trap instead of manly </br></br>  If Urobutcher loved UBW more than HF, and considered Rin his waifu over Dark Sakura, how different would Fate/Zero be?    <br> (which, you know, actually happens now) <br><br>As a brief fanservice meeting. Your fanfic is that they stayed together, how cute.</br></br></br>  <br>What year was this made? This shit is actually coming to pass with all the fucking Saber variants we have now.</br>  <br>Butcher considers Rin to be the main heroine of FSN and the best waifu for Shirou.</br>  <br><br>Rev up that power level knowledge, /a/.<br><br>Who would win?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if they lose the dolphins.</br>  <br>Shirou and Waver? No, they just kinda met once.<br><br>Shirou and Rin get a happily ever after though.</br></br></br>    <br><br>They will probably do Fate too then if this does well.</br></br>  <br> Uro: It isn't a relationship fueled by instinct like the relationship between a man and a woman, but a romance of logic between two people who need each other from the heart. I think the Saber route could have been told as a story through the ancient Greek views on love. That's what makes Saber's story so refreshing, and why she's become such a popular character. On the other hand, I think the true heroine of Fate/stay night is Rin. In the Rin route, an equal relationship with a woman who's become stronger than men is depicted. Rin and Shirou mend each other's weaknesses with their own unique strengths, and I think it makes for a very nice relationship. </br>    <br> They will probably do Fate too then if this does well. <br> Fatefags still desperate and grasping  <br>They released the route on IOS for a reason. They don't care about you or your shit route. There's more important Fate/shit to adapt after this.</br></br></br>  I read all the VNs, and enjoyed them, but since watched all the series/movies too when they each came out.<br><br>And now I prefer the series and movies, I can't read VNs anymore, they are too tedious - I probably won't even look at the Tsukihime remake, it pains me.</br></br>  <br> More F/SN <br><br>Pls no. I hope they animate Extra or Apocrypha after HF.</br></br></br>  <br> Extra <br>If SHAFT does it.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but the edgelords here don't want to recognize that.</br>  <br> And now I prefer the series and movies <br>You prefer the DEEN series to the VN? Are you a monster or a retard?<br> I probably won't even look at the Tsukihime remake, it pains me. <br>Why? It's short as shit compared to Fate and it's way more engaging/less tedious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which Hero would they pick for an adaptation of Extra? It would have to be between Saber and Caster as there's no real point in Archer after adapting UBW.</br>  <br>Nasu.</br>  <br> SHAFT <br><br>I want to see a Red Man head tilt.</br></br></br>  <br>will there finally be a sex scene?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br>Because it's still a VN - I don't enjoy VNs now.</br></br>  <br>  Gilgamesh  </br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Saber=more money, even if the right choice is Caster.</br>  <br>He doesn't appear till CCC.</br>  <br>Male Hakuno and Archer for full fujo bait.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>They could make Extra = Male + Saber<br>CCC = Female + Gilgamesh.</br></br>  <br>Can you repeat the question?</br>  <br>Archer and Female MC seems to be the most popular choice.</br>  <br>Higher chance for a rape scene with Shinji than a sex scene.</br>  <br>They did that to Gil.</br>  <br><br>Why are people acting like Zero is somehow completely separate and different story, that shouldn't even be referenced? It fucking happened. Making the connection is only natural, because it has always been there. Deal with it.</br></br>  I hope for Great Grail OST: http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=P1lc<wbr>ZM0MNek</wbr>  [ ]<br>Will be awesome and very atmospheric.</br>  <br>How is shaft better then UFO again? That looks like shit.</br>  <br> How is shaft better then UFO again? <br>No Rhinos.</br></br>  <br>I liked the CCC opening<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Grl<wbr>Lqnc3vlI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Still better than this trash</br>    <br>Is this just art and not a new Fate spinoff?</br>  <br>Live stream threads always had the genuine reactions.</br>  <br>Most likely a manga.</br>  <br>Just pictures.</br>  <br>Only the music is good everything else is subpar for a opening.</br>  <br> My son who I didn't even know I had became a Servant! <br>Best ranobe.</br></br>  <br> For VN readers, it was great because it added info, <br><br>Yeah, I was surprised and then delighted at the revelation of just how inhuman the Einzberns had become. We thought Acht was just a long-lived Mage, but knowing for a fact he was just a homunculus... there weren't any actual people left.<br><br> but they'd have added info in Acht instead of fucking AM Iri, what the fuck was that. <br><br>Eh, it made Avenger relevant and made marginal sense given Ilya's connection to the Grail.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. Based Wakeshima Kanon.</br>  <br> Ayaka <br> we will never get more Ayako </br></br>  <br>She is a Shiki clone and Medusa's scrapped model. Her only relevancy is as the friends of the main characters. Yeah don't expect anything.</br>  <br> Wormslut route </br>  <br> Medusa's scrapped model <br>Well that explains a lot about H/A.</br></br>  Bait aside is this Shirou stronger than UTW? all I remember is Archer giving him an arm.  <br>Whoever has Prototype Arthur.</br>  <br> stronger than UTW? <br>Dude what?<br>Anyways no, HF Shirou is only at his peak when he has the arm which kills him on use afterwards he is the weakest Shirou.<br>You could say that at his peak he is stronger than UBW Shirou but with no RM I am not sure.<br>UBW Shirou&gt;Fate Shirou&gt;HF Shirou<br>After the route.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd argue that HF Shirou &gt; Fate Shirou.<br><br>HF Shirou knows about UBW and can reach it with training, while Fate Shirou has yet to learn about his only magic.</br></br></br>  <br>Rejoice anon. Kotomine's dream will come true.</br>  <br>His one-hit offensive power is servant tier, except using it kills him dead and he's in the process of turning in to Swords. UBW Shirou &gt; HF Shirou in every aspect that matters.</br>  <br> ufotable will never stop making fate garbage </br>  <br>And he's right. I started Heaven's Feel thinking it would suck and be like the first two routes. But it surprised me the most out of all 3. It easily had the best story.<br><br>Even tho I don't like Sakura much, her route and story beats Rin and Saber's route.</br></br></br>  <br> this will never happen </br>  <br> fate <br> garbage <br><br>stay pleb my friend... stay pleb</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your hell is my heaven.</br>  <br>HF Doll Shirou has problems with mana flow, we also don't know if he is training. Fate Shirou doesn't know about his RM but will keep training and achieve it later in life according to Nasu.</br>  <br>Thank god.</br>  <br>We don't know if he is training, but Rin explicitly states that with training he will reach it.</br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br>Rider has a crush on her.</br>  Trilogy or it's confirmed shit.  <br><br>There's rape in Rakkyo so maybe.</br></br>  <br>He has a hurdle with the mana flow problems, he needs Sakura to supply him with mana. That's why she wanted to get him a new body, but Sakura doesn't really care. And the scene you are talking about is just Rin hyping them up, she hasn't even made jewel sword. Remember that Shirou never found magic to be fun he only pursued it for his ideal, and a ideal less Shirou shouldn't give a fuck.</br>  <br>Two movies would be enough. They don't need every scene of cooking.</br>  You think we'll ever get newer fate material animated? What series is most likely to get an adaptation?  <br>Apocrypha</br>  <br>Wow, that promo Rin looks completely different to what the anime aims for.</br>  <br>Prototype seems the most likely. I wish strange fake would happen, but it won't.</br>  <br><br>They are moving on to ''Tales of'' series adaptations now</br></br>  <br>Isn't that Prisma's Rin?</br>  <br>It's fairly close to the manga version.</br>  <br>prisma rin looks even more derpy.</br>  <br>Yeah, and she looks different compared to Prisma ANIME Rin. Closer to the manga version.</br>  <br> only spotted the massive logo below her after posting <br>Before the scorn, let me give myself the Sherlock award of the day.<br><br><br>Well, I like it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the manga version too. Anime is way too off the original design.</br>  UBW was a shameless cash grab.<br>HF will be the route they throw all their big names and top animators at.</br>  <br> implying the budget isn't dead by now <br>Can't wait for slideshow HF</br></br>  As someone who likes HF, I kinda don't really think it needs an adaption.<br><br>Especially multiple major motion pictures.<br>Most people really only care about the last 3 days of HF, having to go through the entire story to get to that point is going to turn a lot of people off.<br><br>I feel like the HF manga is a better way to do the story justice, and really all that is needed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Arthur is Saber without the jobbing as the Strongest Servant. He even fucks an A++ Divine Beast with Invisible Air.</br>  <br>This, they animated UBW to get money to make HF even better.<br>5 movies 2 hours long incoming.</br></br>  <br>Somehow, I think a slideshow would suite HF.</br>  <br> surpsassing shit with shit </br>  <br><br>I just want my Rain scene, man.</br></br>  <br>There's a lot of stuff that happens before those three days. I wasn't bored at all when I read it. It just doesn't focus on action to tell the story like UBW does.</br>  <br><br>I can taste the delusions</br></br>  <br>They'll never top LONDON waifu.</br>  You can just see how desperate she is for cock.  <br>Rin romance was pointless, the parting shot of UBW was Shirou alone in a fucking desert. <br><br>HF parting shot are Shirou with his loved ones watching cherry blossoms.</br></br></br>  <br> Going on adventure with his waifu <br> having fun, suffer and eventually settling with a happy ending <br> worse than pseudo doll shirou living in a broken body <br>N O</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rin romance was pointless, the parting shot of UBW was Shirou alone in a fucking desert. <br>God I though all you faggots that couldn't understand subtle shit were gone back to MAL.</br></br>  <br><br> all this grasping <br><br>Parting shot is Shirou alone in a desert. It plays as contrast to Shirou surrounded by his family watching flowers bloom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand that picture at all.</br>  <br>It's just contrasting with how out of place he felt in the clocktower, Shirou is in his element saving people and adventuring.</br>  <br> Parting shot is Shirou alone in a desert. <br>Do I realy have to quote Nasu's blog or do you admitt that you intentionaly missinterpret a symbolic scene?<br><br>Also the parting-shot is Rin and Shirou in London while it becomes night</br></br></br></br>  <br> really only care about the last 3 days of HF <br>My exact feelings towards UBW.</br></br>  <br>He is running away from Lancelot due the fact he doesn't want to get beaten again.</br>  <br> Lancelot <br> Beat Gawain <br>Come now, Lancelot isn't an abusive lover. Lancelot loves Gawain too much for that.</br></br></br>  <br>He's trepassing the mexican frontier since he's chasing lancelot who ran that way.</br>  <br> the parting shot of UBW was Shirou alone in a fucking desert. <br>He smiles because Rin is in front you idiot.</br></br>  <br>Visually I am sure it will. But aside from that I really have my doubts. <br>Unless they do as many movies as KnK got, HF is going to be a mess. But at the very least it will be cool to look at. Like the PSV openings.</br></br>  <br> Unless they do as many movies as KnK got, HF is going to be a mess. <br> HF needs 8 fucking movies <br>Are you fucking dumb?</br></br></br>  <br>You are right it's too little it needs 10 one hour long movies. HF is much bigger than HF 30 episodes is the least it needs.</br>  <br>We don't need every fucking cooking scene dude.</br>  <br>Yes we fucking do. The best thing of HF is the characterization of the characters when they are in despair.</br>  <br>How is it dumb? HF is no doubt a very large story. And 8 movies would still be less than UBW's tv anime.</br>  <br>How do you make 8 movies that people actualy are willing to pay for to watch.</br>  <br>All year long ticket. Every month a new hour long part comes out.</br>  <br>You can't treat movies like longer episodes of a series.</br>  2 1 and half hour movies.  The movie won't be out for at least 2-3 years. It will be 6 years before they get to the good parts. Most /a/nons would have killed themselves by then anyways.  <br>Yes you can.</br>  <br>Yes, but we don't need EVERY one. There's plenty of skippable stuff in HF and plenty that can be said very quickly. <br><br>It can easily be cutdown. 8 movies would be about UBW's length. At that point just make a series.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, vampirism. Nasu is a faggot and he want Realta Nua to be canon.</br>  <br>I can't blame him from wanting to get away from the eroge stigma, but HF was the only one where I felt it was necessary. Even if I liked how magus semen is mana city. Wouldn't it kind of fuck with Zero if they went the vampire route? It seems like he's trying to bring things in line with Zero more than anything.</br>  <br>I feel it was necessary in UBW too if only because it destroys Rin's magic crest otherwise.</br>  <br>If Shirou and Rin end up having a child couldn't they just give it to it? Wouldn't that fix the lineage thing?</br>  <br>The edgiest pair.</br>  <br>You are assuming that it matters in the first place.<br>Nothing in the epilogue even hinted at that.</br></br>  <br> "This will surpass UBW" <br>It's good that they are trying to surpass one of their own work at least. No top Evangelion or Gundam bullshit.</br></br>  <br>I feel like there could be a better way to transfer mana. I just find it weird the ONLY way to do it in proper Nasuverse seems to be sex. It would be nice if we could have both.</br>  <br>tfw there are 4 pendragons and you know one of them will win</br>  <br>That was literaly made up by the OP</br>  If its anything less than 3 movies its going to have pacing problems. The buildup to HF is what makes the finale so exciting, skipping all of it or shortening it with one movie will be a disgrace.  <br>Two could work fine honestly. Three would probably be perfect, but I doubt it'll be three.</br>  <br> There's plenty of skippable stuff in HF and plenty that can be said very quickly. <br>No you fucking retard. Fucking kill yourself already.</br></br>  <br>sex was for shitty magus like shirou, actual magus and experienced users only need to concentrate while touching you. I don't know what the fuck is up with it in Prisma IIya, I guess the IIyafag that wrote is also a hardcore lolicon and took advantage of that excuse to have lolis french kissing and groping.</br>  <br>He would be a fucking monster with all the prana Sakura will give him.</br>  <br>All F/Z servants besides Saber have their stats maxed out.</br>  <br>The buildup was terrible and excessive.<br><br>One movie for the clusterfuck in Illya's forest.<br>One movie for everything in the cave.<br><br>Literally nothing else in the entire route matters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that sakura <br>Who is the artist for that?</br></br>  <br>I wonder what stats Berserker Lancelot would have under Dark Sakura?</br>  <br><br>The 'war' part of it was a sham to begin with. And Heroic Spirit, by nature of what the ritual is, are in actuality, garbage to be recycled into a pot of souls, to be used as fuel to shoot a hole to the root. It was just showing the truth of the matter.</br></br>  <br> No you fucking retard. <br>We don't need a 5 minutes of only cooking happening and Shirou saying some stuff about how he likes this life. That takes like five seconds to do in animation. It's not that hard to figure out you dumb shit.</br></br>  <br>Everything in the crest Rin already knew she will just make a new one or something. Who cares? Rin treated it as a possession not some fountain of knowledge.</br>  <br>you are truly the edge</br>  <br> actual magus and experienced users only need to concentrate while touching you. <br>I guess I do remember that being said at some point.<br>  I don't know what the fuck is up with it in Prisma IIya, I guess the IIyafag that wrote is also a hardcore lolicon and took advantage of that excuse to have lolis french kissing and groping. <br> Thank God for that. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally nothing else in the entire route matters <br>I'd have an entire movie devoted to Kotomine discovering his love for Mapo Tofu.<br><br>Not overly high &amp; the lack of spamable Excaliblasts won't make it as effective as Saber Alter. Alter had some stats reduced in fact.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He might as well be quoting the VN.</br>  <br> Literally nothing else in the entire route matters. <br>what?</br></br>  <br> We don't have any idea how to do HF yet. Nothing is decided, so there is nothing to talk about. But if you watched UBW, you surely would be amazed. I think we'll have to wait for another couple of years. <br><br>That's what Takeuchi actually said.</br></br></br>  <br>Exept that he can't use his sword because it's cost a shittone of mana, Karya died after like a minute or two from exhaustion after Lancelot bring up Arondight</br>  <br> I think we'll have to wait for another couple of years. <br>I predict the first movie for either fall 2016 or spring 2017</br></br>  <br>oh lol mordred would kill shirou if he tries his "your a girl, i must protect you" routine on her</br>  <br> HF is only cooking scenes! <br>Fuck off with your stupid Meme and read the route dumbfuck. I am so tired of this shit, Fate and UBW have more fucking cooking than HF.</br></br>  <br><br>We'll get an extended epilogue of Shirou helping Sakura clean up the city and rebuild Ryuudo Temple. With some long haired Sakura being trained by a swanky bishop of the church. With cute shadow giant chibis helping her work.<br><br>Now if Nasu gives ufo some actual designs of Priest Dilo, we will finally know how he looks like. I mean, he was supposed to be Sakura's new mentor and father figure, why he didn't get lines or a design is beyond me.</br></br></br></br>  <br> We don't have any idea how to do HF yet. Nothing is decided <br>He doesn't say that though, これから固める just mean they are still in the planning phase but that doesn't mean they have no idea how to do it</br></br>  <br> I'd have an entire movie devoted to Kotomine discovering his love for Mapo Tofu. <br><br>Shit mate, you have me there.</br></br></br>  <br> she will just make a new one or something <br>I'm not sure you understand how a magic crest works.<br><br> As the complexity of the Crest increases with each new generation, the spells stored inside them become more stable and easier to activate. As long as the Crest is completely integrated with the magus' body, he will be able to cast any spell recorded in the crest, even if he himself never had the chance to learn it properly. <br><br>The crest is built over generations. It is incredibly valuable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There isn't a shitton of cooking in HF it's just a meme! <br>I didn't say nothing happens. Just that things could be done quicker and some skipped over. Fucking reading comprehension.</br></br>  <br> Sakura pleases old priests for tutoring <br>Why am I not surprised?</br></br>  <br> I think we'll have to wait for another couple of years. <br>Damn.</br></br>  there is a legitimate chance that the ovas, however many there are, won't be completed until 2020<br><br>what will you all have accomplished by then?</br></br>  WHO'S READY FOR SOME FUCKING COOKING?  <br>That's why starting with Zero is good, you can see a 'standard' Grail war, then see it subverted. It's far more effective to demonstrate rules rather than just telling them, and it's a weakness that shows up quite a bit on the original VN. Certain twists, like Gil's existence and Fake assassin, are less effective because of this. Instead, the reader is like, 'oh ok then'</br>  <br>So it's not knowledge it's just that the engine gets better in time? This makes no sense, you got a source?</br>  <br>Fuck off secondary.</br>  <br><br>You're a fucking idiot, half of the plot for Stay Night is spoiled if you watch Zero first.</br></br>  <br> he will be able to cast any spell recorded in the crest, even if he himself never had the chance to learn it properly. <br><br>Seems to me that a crest is just training wheels for magus that suck. Rin is everything but that. She will still need to craft a new one for the next generation, and HA showed how annoying they are to maintain.</br></br></br>  <br> ova <br>Why wouldn't there be a cinema release?</br></br>  <br><br>For shame, the guy is supposed to be her father figure, get your head out of the gutter.<br><br>Now that I think about it, those shadow giants can be made into a plushie line. We may even get a milf Sakura figure with them riding on her shoulders like that one pic in side material.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kariya is confirmed to nerf the Servant in the novel. Iskander also has shit stats because of Waver. Obvious that Gilles is also nerfed.</br>  <br> designs of Priest Dilo <br>I want him to be the human equivalent of a turtle</br></br>  <br>  I'd have an entire movie devoted to Kotomine discovering his love for Mapo Tofu. <br><br>Fuck yes. Now I want to see this more than Spar Liner High.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It also what lets Rin cast Gandr without a auditory component.</br></br>  <br>Nothing in HF can be done quickly or be skipped over retard, everything is required for the right characterization.</br>  <br>Probably EX in AGI and A++ or A+++ in the rest with Arondight.<br><br><br>That's because she couldn't handle the rage coming from Angry Mainyu, Lancelot has EAM to deal with that kind of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> right characterization <br><br>Everyone already hates wormslut. Reducing her screentime can only benefit her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>When it's first part is released in 2020 by ufoTABLE after their done murdering themselves trying to get God Eater and Tales of Zestiria out. Personally I'm not convinced the anime industry as it is is even going to last that long.</br></br>  <br>Fucking retarded secondary scum. UBW ended, we don't have to deal with your shit anymore.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br> Everyone already hates wormslut. <br>I heard she is Ufotable's waifu.</br></br>  <br>Here they come, King of Heroes! Do you have enough bone in your sword?</br>  <br>Because it is.<br><br>RN doesn't have penisworms.<br><br>Zero does.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Just that things could be done quicker and some skipped over <br>no</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not how stats work, and Lancelot was always at his strongest under Kariya. Berserkers are always balls out, there's no off-switch on their stats unlike with normal servants, rather than throttling their abilities if they have less mana, Berserkers just burn through it all until they run out and die, e.g. like how Lancelot lost.</br></br>  <br>Ufo already shot themselves in the foot when they tried to animate GE when UBW 2nd cour is airing, HF isn't coming anytime soon.</br>  <br><br>It's like the Gundam of teen fantasy franchises only the fans never shut the fuck up and there's more than just non-stop complaining.</br></br>  <br><br>Less than Zero and much less than Love Live.</br></br>  <br>They can animate UBW on Flash and it will still sell.<br>That's why all the big names went over to God Eater.</br></br>  <br><br>His stats would be basically the same as before, he's not like Saber whose primary source of power is Prana Burst which becomes overloaded when she has such a vast supply of prana and turns her into a walking tank. Lancelot would just have a nigh limitless source of power.</br></br>  <br> Lancelot was always at his strongest under Kariya. <br> Isn’t it obvious? Kariya, you should know that as a magus, your abilities are not just one or two notches below the other Masters. It will affect the basic abilities of the Servant. <br>Nice fanfic right there. Making him a Berserker was only to make up for the shit that Kariya was, not to make him stronger.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see much complaining in Fate thread that only have fans in them. The worst threads have all been about currently airing stuff. Not even Strange Fake gets that treatment and it's current.<br><br>Hopefully, the frenching lolis will keep the fags away when Prisma is back on.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not how Berserkers work. <br>He would have the same stats but wouldn't kill Sakura from prana drain.<br>Regular servants get different stats according to their master's prana supply, but don't kill their masters. Berserkers always fight full power regardless of the consumption, and the master's ability determines how long they can sustain them until they eventually get emptied and die.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hype and advertising. They pretty much have to have a certain upkeep otherwise it's going to die down again. That's why you have pretty much constant stuff for it coming out.</br></br>  I wonder how much bamcobucks ufotable is getting over the next year.<br><br>There's no way quality can be maintained throughout god eater and zestiria considering the historical pace at which ufotable puts out shows.</br></br>  <br> It also what lets Rin cast Gandr without a auditory component. <br>It doesn't say that, just says that it's a shortcut for spells recorded. She still needs to make a new crest and re-record it for the next generation.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, Kariya would reduce the stats of a normal Servant, which is why Zouken gave him a Berserker. <br><br>Making Lancelot a Berserker means A) he'll get a stat boost from Mad Enhancement and B) his stats will never drop no matter how little prana he or Kariya has. Every master that owned a Berserker before Ilya died because Berserkers are prana guzzling machines that have no off-switch.</br></br></br></br>  <br> This will surpass UBW <br>What is the context of this quote? Can anyone translate the entire quote?<br>It makes it sound like the adaptation is far is production, but we can't be sure.</br></br></br>  <br>People forget that Zero first sold 42k and new data put them in 50k. UBW sold 35k and we don't have new data for that.</br>  <br> Berserkers always fight full power regardless of the consumption, and the master's ability determines how long they can sustain them until they eventually get emptied and die. <br>Citation needed. Regular Servants can still kill their Masters if they want, as proven by Iskander.</br></br>  <br>Everyone in UFO loves Sakura and are excited to animate her route. It's going to be so much better than UBW because it's not a dumb cash grab.</br>  <br>Read the thread.</br>  <br> "This will surpass UBW" <br><br>Make t sound like that is something hard.</br></br></br>  <br><br> everyone <br>fuck off, its a meme.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Zero is from a different universe than FSN, Fate route shows this.</br>  <br>UBW is probably the best animated Type Moon series they have made.</br>  <br>Damn, Ayaka's dripping for Seiba.<br><br>Sakura became super-lewd. Would Seiba have been able to save her had she been summoned instead of Rider?</br></br></br>  <br>Berserker class was made to make up for shit Servants, not shit Masters. You are just making up a ton of bullshit that's not said anywhere. A regular Servant like Iskander could make their Master die if he wanted to make them pay for the prana.</br>  <br> Probably EX in AGI and A++ or A+++ in the rest with Arondight <br>It should be noted that Saber Alter has an AGI stat far below Rin-Saber. I doubt that Lancelot Alter's AGI will increase.</br></br>  <br><br>I meant Gundam. Gundam threads have pretty much non-stop complaining as the default and usual sole reaction. Fate threads it's like a mix, though usually Gundam threads are full of bitter shitposters in their late 20's and early 30's while Fate thread are full of hype kids on their sugar rush that buy 100% into the hype atmosphere and advertising and think it's the most perfect flawless thing ever.</br></br>  <br>So you want 20 minutes of monologue from Shirou saying he enjoys living with Sakura and then 20 minutes of him worrying about her? I swear this same shit was said about UBW. Animation is fucking different than VNs. Stop forgetting that.</br>  Here's why we need 3 endings for perfect pacing, HF almost has 3 crescendos the only issue one of those crescendos is nine lives which is so close to the end so how do we divide this up is pretty simple.<br><br>Movie 1 end: After the branch point for mind of steel with the rain scene<br><br>Movie 2: End with the death of archer and Shirou's arm being torn off post credit scene probably being the operation<br><br>Movie 3 for the rest. There I just made perfect way to divide them up, you can decide on how much cooking time you want yourselves but I'd like my jewgold now ufotable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what is KnK <br>But its not like they've done a lot of series.</br></br>  <br> only to make up for the shit that Kariya was <br>No, it's because Zouken wanted to screw Kariya over. Kariya could have actually sustained all that's needed another servant class. Had Zouken decided to have him summon Lancelot in another class, Kariya would have fared better.</br></br>  <br>How about you quote something that says Berserker Lancelot would have higher stats under a stronger master? <br>Go read the fucking LN and VN before you come here and post fanfiction.</br></br>  <br>Can't handle the darkness, which is why her Instinct also got fucked. Lancelot has EAM to deal with rage issues.</br>  <br>KnK wasn't very good.</br>  <br>You are the one saying that Berserkers always have their full stats based on nothing. If anything, burden of proof is on you.</br>  <br>Pretty sure Gander is on the crest considering she always fires it from her left arm. I highly doubt she knew multiple generations worth of spells so a new crest is gonna be pretty shit.<br><br><br>This man was more right than he realized</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes it's up to the director to make those interesting. Now fuck off you don't know what you are talking about.</br>  <br> her Instinct also got fucked <br>I thought wanting to die had something to do with that.<br> Eternal Arms Mastery <br>That handles motor skills, not stats. Lancelot could have been the slowest servant there &amp; the skill wouldn't have changed that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> KnK wasn't very good. <br>Good joke.</br></br>  <br> think it's the most perfect flawless thing ever. <br>This is the mistake that people like you make. We don't have to think it's perfect to enjoy it and we don't have to prove to you that it's an "objectively good series" to enjoy it either. Some people just want to enjoy the things they enjoy.<br><br>I remember that in threads even Saberfags would agree that out of all the routes, Fate route was poor and didn't really compare to the rest. How is that "thinking that it's the most perfect flawless thing"?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is what is popular now and considered good animation though. You might not have noticed but pretty much all the most popular shows feature little more than agonizingly slow pace monologuing, expository dialogue and people obsessing over minor details instead of moving the story along. I can't help but feel that Unlimited Blade Works could have had maybe 2/3 the episode count and still turned out plenty fine if not better paced even. It's just so immensely drawn out, but again that's what's popular now. That Haruhi movie could have easily trimmed a good 40 minutes and nothing would be changed but people claim it's about building atmosphere and making the viewers feel how the cast feels. Never mind you can still accomplish that in about a fraction of the time if you have a good director/writer team, but god forbid you leave any line of dialogue out otherwise the source fags will bitch up a storm.<br><br>Basically blame obsessive source fags for why so many adaptations of popular otaku stuff are so ridiculously drawn out and kind of boring to casuals nowadays.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Under a good Master he would've been able to use Aronfight, allowing him to increase all his stat by one rank.</br>  <br>Kariya faring better doesn't mean the Servant isn't gimped. Shirou is fine, yet Saber is fucked.</br>  <br><br> Berserker class was made to make up for shit Servants, not shit Masters. <br><br>What does that have to do with the mechanics of a Servant?<br><br> A regular Servant like Iskander could make their Master die if he wanted to make them pay for the prana. <br><br>Regular Servants have no reason to do that ever. Berserkers are insane, or in Lancelot's case, downright despicable sons of bitches who don't give a fuck about the safety of their master, and will not stop draining their master's prana until they die so that they can fight at full strength. Lancelot never stopped fighting at full strength, he kicked Saber's ass right up until Kariya died and he ran empty. <br><br>You know what's making up bullshit that's not said anywhere?<br><br> hurr lancelot would have EX stats and A+++ everything else under Dark Sakura! HE'S THE BEST SERVANT EVERRRRRR </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You started off with a baseless argument in the first place.<br>Fact is unless you back your claim up with proof, it's just fanfiction.</br></br>  <br>We're talking about base stats. Those would not change,</br>  <br> I thought wanting to die had something to do with that. <br>Exactly, can't handle the darkness.<br><br> That handles motor skills, not stats <br>If the nerf is coming from a mental hindrance, he should be fine. If it's coming from something else well he is fucked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No actually I think some very vocal people actually do. Like I literally don't even want to bother talking about the show half the time cause I figure all that's going to happen is some obsessive sourcefag is going to go on some spiel about how I don't have my canon 110% exactly right to the line of dialogue because of something the anime left out or something I don't give nearly a shit about as much as they do. Yeah you have some rational folk now and again, but there's more than enough of those sourcefag types who never shut the fuck up and think everybody is as obsessed with the franchise as they are and that it's their god given mission to correct the secondaries that always ruin it for everyone. It's so fucking stupid and overdramatic and why the Fate fanbase kind of has a bad reputation now.</br></br>  <br>My argument is based on the fact that Kariya is stated to nerf the Servant. You came up with NO BERSERKERS DON'T WORK THAT WAY BECAUSE I SAID SO. <br><br>So, burden of proof is on you.</br></br></br>  <br> faring better doesn't mean the Servant isn't gimped <br>Clearly Kariya was able to supply enough prana for Lancelot to fight effectively. The prana cost screwed him over by sucking him dry. If Lancelot's stats can be reduced for longer survival times, I bet Kariya would have done that already.</br></br>  <br> Now fuck off you don't know what you are talking about. <br> calls others retards when he has no idea how adapting to other mediums work <br>It's impressive the MUH VN fags are already at work saying it has to be 1:1 or it's shit. <br><br>I think 2/3s is a stretch and personally didn't feel UBW dragged that much, but I get where you're coming from. I know a lot of HF is building atmosphere and those scenes are important, but we don't need every single line of dialouge going through Shirou's head while he's watching her cook or taking care of her. Especially with movies.</br></br></br></br></br>   Lancelot <br> Not summoned as Lancer </br>  <br> implying Zouken doesn't deliver cold hard facts </br>  <br> Regular Servants have no reason to do that ever. <br>They could if they wanted and that doesn't mean their stats will increase.<br><br> You know what's making up bullshit that's not said anywhere? <br>A+ with shit Master, another + from good Master, another + from Angry, another + from Arondight. That's EX.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kariya is stated to be shitty enough to nerf normal Servants, and Zouken immediately after that statement gives him a Berserker so that his servant won't be nerfed at all. Don't take one statement out of the context of the dialogue.</br></br>  <br> can't handle the darkness <br>As emo as Lancelot is, I doubt he'd fare better. Not every servant the Shadow took over did as well as Saber Alter.<br> he should be fine <br>I'm claiming that Lancelot might very well suffer a speed decrease like Saber did. That's something unrelated to his motor skills. A++ speed with a master that made Saber's speed a D when even Shirou made it a C likely wouldn't increase it. Sakura likely doesn't value speed so much despite her massive prana.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Clearly Kariya was able to supply enough prana for Lancelot to fight effectively. T <br>That's not what the novel says.</br></br>  <br>That's because there used to be threads that were full of "primaries" then a bunch of people came along and started bitching about things they knew nothing about.So then others corrected them and they got defensive. The people making the Fate threads for years on /a/ weren't people like you. <br><br>If you want to be a fan then be one, but nobody wants to have to handhold faggots through things that only they think are plot holes. This is not unique to the Fate fanbase at all. Half the things that people get confused about can be googled.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He was only up and about for a few months prior to the epilogue, and he was busy graduating, getting used to the body and it's issues, and altogether making up for the fact he was incapacitated for a whole year.</br></br>  <br>KnK's animation is pretty subpar for a movie series</br>  <br>He might have received his white shields with red stripes. That would actually be rather strong.</br>  <br>He said to make up for it, not to stop being nerfed. It seems like you don't have anything to back up your fanfic theory about Berserkers.</br>  <br> I highly doubt she knew multiple generations worth of spells so a new crest is gonna be pretty shit. <br>You do know it doesn't go back that far, and she is the most talented of all that came before it. If she got admitted into the CT it means the crest wasn't a big deal. Aoko's crest is the shit because it contains the fifth magic in there.</br></br>  <br><br>You people are nuts.</br></br>  <br>Kariya!Lancelot has the same ammount of stats as Herakles.<br><br>If he's nerfed than Urobutcher can't into stats</br></br></br>  <br>Actually he just said that people who watched UBW are going to be surprised.</br>  Here is the updated stats so far.  <br>Lancelot is a Servant that is supposed to be able to stall Numeral Gawain, him having higher stats than Heracles wouldn't be much of a surprise.</br>  <br> That's not what the novel says <br>Lancelot never really showed any "I'm nerfed by lack of prana" in his fights. The only time it really came into play is when Kariya died &amp; he disappeared.</br></br>  <br> Urobutcher can't into stats <br>After comparing Kerry-Saber's stats with Rin-Saber who's supposed to be the most suitable master for Saber, I can agree.</br></br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>I hope you realise how retarded that sounds.</br>  <br>HF had some of the best Rin scenes too.<br>And yes as a fellow Rinfag i agree that HF is best route.</br></br>  <br><br> They could if they wanted and that doesn't mean their stats will increase. <br><br>Yes, their stats probably would not increase if they did so because only tremendously shitty masters like Shirou have caused a Servant's stats to visibly decrease in the status screen. Most Masters are capable of supplying prana to their Servants, so their stats are almost never reduced no matter how weak a master might be. Shirou was flat out incapable of doing so. <br><br> A+ with shit Master, <br><br>A+ with Mad Enhancement. Otherwise, it would be B+.<br><br> another + from good Master, <br><br>Having better masters doesn't give you bonus modifiers. In fact, it's very unlikely that having a better master would be a big enough difference to increase a Servant's stats up a rank unless the difference is between Shirou, who cannot supply prana, and Rin, who is one of the most talented Masters ever. <br><br> another + from Angry <br><br>Being blackened does not buff you unless you're like Saber who has Prana Burst as an intrinsic ability. Berserker lost Godhand and was reduced to a rotting carcass when he was blackened. Gilgamesh was unchanged completely by being blackened. Lancelot does not have any abilities similar to Prana Burst. <br><br> another + from Arondight <br><br>Arondight raises the rank of a stat, it does not give a modifier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm claiming that Lancelot might very well suffer a speed decrease like Saber did. <br>And I'm telling you if it doesn't come from mental problems, then you are right. EAM can only handle mental problems.</br></br>  <br> Numeral Gawaine <br>Silly Rabbit. Tricks are for kids &amp; so are the ones Launcelot used.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't. It was perfect.<br><br> Except for the 6th movie. Fuck that. The novel is god tier though </br></br></br>  <br><br>It has her getting the second magic which is cool. But as a Rinfag I prefer UBW.</br></br>  <br><br>as an UBW rinfag I respectfully disagree with your opinions.</br></br>  <br>Events you would need have to fit into that first, not including scenes that would be a good idea to have<br> high jump classroom scene <br> zouken's goal of immortality and the scene where he consumes that woman <br> sakura ad Shirou's cnversation infront of the heater <br> shirou losing saber at the temple <br> contracting rider <br> shinji being defeated <br> summoning of true assassin <br> finding caster defeated at ryoudou temple <br> the first night Sakura is asked to stays at Shirou's <br> the entire sequence of events leading up to Sakura being kidnapped <br> bloodfort/rescuing Sakura <br> lancer being defeated by the shadow <br> shirou meeting with Illya in the park <br> Sakura periodic fainting <br><br>I'm probably forgetting quite a bit but trying to fit 9 days of a rout into a single movie, especially when the th day is one of the longest in the entire route is possibly one of the dumbest things I've heard. More logically the longer days and climactic days would be made into longer separate films. i.e how ever they decide to divide the earlier shorter films, then day ( long film, ore shorter films. long finale and epilogue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> HF had some of the best Rin scenes too. <br>this is true<br> And yes as a fellow Rinfag i agree that HF is best route. <br>ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh idk about that, though it does have some good scenes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Novel says he nerfs Servants, can't fight that. It's like trying to argue with an Archerfag thinking UBW isn't annoying because he can't accept it.</br>  <br> Kariya is stated to nerf the Servant <br>A normal servant. Read Zero, seriously.<br>It's even in the anime if I recall correctly.<br>Find another quote, you're just twisting words and speculating.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well to bring up the Gundam example again, as a fan of that franchise I can relate cause goddamn are people bad at picking up on details that ARE explained in the show if you actually pay attention as opposed to immediately launching it a bitchfit. Some people still find a way to overdo it though with Fate even still I find.</br></br>  <br>Might sound retarded but that's what actually happened.</br>  <br>Probably he meant people that still don't know what happens in HF. I mean, when I read it the first time it's not like I wasn't surprised with all the shit that goes on.</br>  <br>Her ancestors may have been shit overall but 2 centuries of magic is still a big deal. Clocktower was written before RN. Do you really thing Nasu would bother to change an entire ending?</br>  <br> Yes, their stats probably would not increase if they did so because only tremendously shitty masters like Shirou have caused a Servant's stats to visibly decrease in the status screen.  <br>Even Kiritsugu did.<br><br> Having better masters doesn't give you bonus modifiers. <br>Someone didn't check Saber Luck under different Masters.<br><br> Being blackened does not buff you unless you're like Saber who has Prana Burst as an intrinsic ability <br>Also, as they no longer bother to restrain their magic energy consumption, their fighting ability jumps significantly. This momentum can be compared to a runaway train. <br><br> Berserker lost Godhand <br>Fanfic</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nasu <br> giving a fuck <br>He'll just justify it with "She's a genius"</br></br></br>  This needs three films at minimum.  <br>When was it said it didn't work the same for Berserker? It's what I'm asking for and you people don't seem to have anything to back up that claim.</br>  <br>So from this we can infer Luvia is literally shit tier then right? Since she has a crest and all that.</br>  <br>You can take your shit taste elsewhere.</br>  <br><br><br>Remember that the stats of a Servant are only relative in most cases. They're not the actual Heroic Spirit itself, they're a vessel that has limitations in how it manifests the Heroic Spirit. That's why the rank scale goes from E to A (with spirits like Caster who was a completely ordinary woman gaining the physical strength required to smash a child's skull with ease though she did not have it in real life) and why all these Heroic Spirits have strangely similar stats.<br><br>The only Servant we've seen who has explicitly had the same stats as in her life is Rin!Saber. You can use her as a baseline for Lancelot/Gawain's real stats, which seem to be more or less accurate where they should be if you take the stats they've had in their depictions in Zero and Extra. <br><br>However, Servants like Gilgamesh and Heracles are existences who displayed stats far in excess of what they have in their depictions so far in their respective myths. Gilgamesh is seen complaining that he's weaker and dumber than his true self in CCC due to the limitations of the Servant vessel, while Heracles is someone who "lifted the world on his shoulders for three days and nights" yet his physical strength is not completely unmatched as a Servant. <br><br>So, yeah, take everything with a grain of salt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't it said that having a Master of Rin tier means that you can display the power you had in the legend? Illya is far above Rin tier. Nasu just can't into legends.</br>  <br><br> Even Kiritsugu did. <br><br>Kiritsugu's incompatibility with Saber is what caused Saber's stats to be rearranged, it had nothing to do with prana supply - Saber had Irisviel giving her prana the whole time. Simply, he hated her and she hated him so she had wonky stats. <br><br> Someone didn't check Saber Luck under different Masters. <br><br>Which was Saber going from a master that gave her zero prana to a master that gave her all the prana she could ever ask for and then some.<br><br> Also, as they no longer bother to restrain their magic energy consumption, their fighting ability jumps significantly. This momentum can be compared to a runaway train.  <br><br>Congrats, you came up with one way Lancelot would be stronger as a blackened Servant.<br><br> Berserker lost Godhand <br> Fanfic <br><br>Godhand is Berserker's skin. He had no skin left when he attacked Shirou, it had literally all been torn off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nasu says she is a genius too of her family.<br><br>Even Sakura was able to somewhat overturn complete buttfuckery of her very nature through determination and innate talent.<br><br>Finnish genes stronk.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I always welcome more Rin. UBW was her happy end and it's also my favorite route.</br></br>  <br><br>Having a master on Rin's tier or better means you can display legendary power, meaning something that would make just about anyone shit their pants. It does not necessarily mean you're displaying all of your power.</br></br>  <br>In Hollow Ataraxia Shirou apparently knock up Rin at end of her Eclipse scene. So they will have child eventually.</br>  <br> Kiritsugu's incompatibility with Saber is what caused Saber's stats to be rearranged <br> Artoria’s abilities rose when having Kiritsugu as Master. Her LCK status decreased since even Kiritsugu still could not provide sufficient magical energy, as a result the status was affected by the Master's way of life. <br>I'm starting to think you didn't read Materials.<br><br> Which was Saber going from a master that gave her zero prana to a master that gave her all the prana she could ever ask for and then some. <br>You said having a better Master can't give bonifiers, which is proven wrong.<br><br> Godhand is Berserker's skin. <br>It's the body.<br>This Noble Phantasm does not have an overt external manifestation such as a weapon or armour, but if you hazard to put a shape to it, the body itself can be called the Noble Phantasm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We can infer that her losing her magic crest in RN wasn't that big of a deal. Rin being a genius and all could have already learned all the spells in it. She was able to take one life out of Berserker and beat the shit out of Caster, she is good.</br>  <br> When having Rin as a Master, Artoria was able to unleash her original abilities without being affected by the Master. <br>Nasu can't into legends.</br></br>  <br><br>Regardless, Lancelot having EX and A+++ rank stats is pure fanfic and you should just kill yourself for masturbating to that shit.</br></br>  friendly reminder that all the bad ends are as canon as the good ends due to infinite parallel timelines  <br>modifier*</br>  <br>I can only assume its mostly because jewels are her thing. They never say whats in her crest besides gandr.</br>  Late Game Shirou and Saber with Avalon from Fate vs Late game UBW Shirou, Rin and Saber vs Late game HF Shirou, Rin and Rider<br><br>Who wins?</br></br>  <br>Yeah exactly. It would be hilarious if all the crest was just for Gandr.</br>  <br>Sounds like someone is mad about being wrong about everything.</br>  <br>Stop replying to the shitposter.</br>  <br><br>But he is right a rank up doesn't give you a + modifier.</br></br>  <br> My opinion is more valid than yours! </br>  <br>Check Saber luck under different Masters.<br><br><br>My opinions are kind of backed up by the Materials.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Check Saber luck under different Masters. <br>That's not because it got a rank up due to the master, she was allowed to show her true strength as a servant so it went to her true stats.<br><br>A '+' modifier is not a rank up but a multiplier.</br></br></br></br>  <br> My opinions are kind of backed up by the Materials. <br> kind of <br>Which means you're just speculating, right?</br></br></br>  <br> That's not because it got a rank up due to the master, she was allowed to show her true strength as a servant so it went to her true stats. <br>She should have B+ and D+ if it worked that way. Karna is also an example of this kind of shit.<br><br>If we go with what you are trying to say the next rank is EX which is even more retarded if you think about it. That would mean Arondight Lancelot reaches EX on everything but Mana.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Lancelot reaching EX in AGI is indeed speculated, but based on the information that we have been given (Kariya nerf, Blackening boost). I might be wrong, but until Nasu says something about it, it's the most logical conclusion.</br>  <br> She should have B+ and D+ if it worked that way. <br>No because she was nerfed. Her true luck is A+ but it gets nerfed because of the shit masters she gets. You should be using Medusa's luck stat to show your point as it gets a whole rank because Shinji is lucky, but what that shows is that the stats aren't all connected to the mana the master gives.<br><br> If we go with what you are trying to say the next rank is EX which is even more retarded if you think about it. <br>I honestly have no idea what they were implying with Arondight.</br></br></br></br></br>  When HF comes out will there be a viewing party with hanami?  <br> Karna is also an example of this kind of shit. <br>Eh no.<br>Karna in CCC simply lied about his stats.</br></br></br>  <br>A drinking game with Sakura's senpai should be made.</br>  <br><br> Kariya nerf <br>Taken out of context. Zouken was talking about summoning a normal servant, he didn't say anything about nerfing a Berserker.<br>Side material also states that Kariya is quite competent for a master. He's nowhere near as shitty as, say, Shirou.<br><br> Blackening boost <br>There's no such thing as a blackening boost. Blackened Berserker is weaker than normal Berserker and Saber Alter is weaker than Rin Saber.<br><br>So, as you can see, all your "arguments" were actually made up stuff from your own headcanon. Your claims are just a mere opinion, not facts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> shadow giant plushie <br><br>Please don't give Aniplex even more ideas to drain money from us.<br><br>The new Sakura figure sounds good though.<br><br>Who an I kidding. I know I will buy both.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Artoria’s abilities rose when having Kiritsugu as Master. Her LCK status decreased since even Kiritsugu still could not provide sufficient magical energy, as a result the status was affected by the Master's way of life. <br>It is connected.<br><br> I honestly have no idea what they were implying with Arondight <br>If according to you the rank that comes after A is EX, and Arondight gives a rank up to all his parameters, what would the result be? EX in everything. Now that sounds like a wank, doesn't it? Even I that I'm a Lancelotfag can't accept a bullshit like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He said going Berserker was to amend for Kariya being trash by raising the parameters from the root, not that the Servant wouldn't stay nerfed, which is what you have been trying to say the entire time failing to provide anything to back it up. Kariya is competent for a makeshift, not competent under normal standards. And you don't really have to be Shirou tier shit to nerf. Even Kiritsugu nerfed.<br><br> There's no such thing as a blackening boost.  <br>Also, as they no longer bother to restrain their magic energy consumption, their fighting ability jumps significantly. This momentum can be compared to a runaway train.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes the rank that comes after A is EX. I did not say that Arondight would give it EX, just that modifiers don't work the way you think they do.<br><br> It is connected. <br>No shit, that's also why Shirou's Saber has B and not A+ like she should have. My point was that having infinite mana isn't going to give more power to a servant when they are already capped.</br></br></br></br>  I wonder if this sword didn't lose it's holy status would it be able to fire an excaliblast?  <br>You still refuse to quote the LN, huh?<br>Zouken never said that Berserker would be nerfed in any way.<br><br> as they no longer bother to restrain their magic energy consumption, their fighting ability jumps significantly <br>Lancelot NEVER restrains his magic energy consumption, as it's the case with all Berserkers. Also, this has nothing to do with stats.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>1 shot every 2/3 sempais.</br>  <br>You could always overload it with prana and make it blow up like a Broken Phantasm, that's pretty close to an excaliblast.</br>  <br>I'll go with 3 any less would give me alcohol poisoning.</br>  Anyone want Kenji Kawai to return for composer?  <br> Yes the rank that comes after A is EX. I did not say that Arondight would give it EX, just that modifiers don't work the way you think they do. <br>You didn't say it would give EX, but that's what it will be if what you are saying was true. Arondight raises all parameters by a rank, and he is already all A.<br><br> No shit, that's also why Shirou's Saber has B and not A+ like she should have. <br>She should have B+.<br><br> My point was that having infinite mana isn't going to give more power to a servant when they are already capped. <br>Blackened Servants lose that limitation, their fighting ability jumps significantly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't know I think the composer from the UBW anime would be better for the darker mood of HF.</br>  <br>Maybe. There is nothing that indicates it would, but there is nothing that indicates it wouldn't. After all, it did lose it's holy status.<br><br><br><br>But Arondight can't take damage, how would it explode?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Zouken never said that Berserker would be nerfed in any way. <br>He said Kariya nerfed the Servant. Then said he was going to amend that by raising the parameters from the root up. Where is it said that going Berserker stopped Lancelot from being nerfed?<br><br> Lancelot NEVER restrains his magic energy consumption, as it's the case with all Berserkers. <br>No idea what that meant but it is pretty clear it applied to everything that was Blackened.<br> The blackened Servant is incarnated by the power of the Grail so the more concrete ties to the physical plane turns them into powerful beings. <br>The whole entry is wanking the Blackened Servants as being stronger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But Arondight can't take damage, how would it explode? <br>Nasu puts these infodumps in for a reason</br></br>  <br>Arondight is not "it won't break", it's literally takes no damage.</br>   Finally can run the Android version of Fate <br><br>Fucking region lock.</br></br>  <br>File on!<br>Captcha off!</br></br>  <br><br>I selfishly want them to bring back M.H. for This Illusion.</br></br>  <br> believing what Rin says  <br>didn't rin say that Emiya's magic ability is impossible multiple times?</br></br>  <br> more fatshit <br><br>oh boy</br></br></br>  <br> didn't rin say that Emiya's magic ability is impossible multiple times? <br>Not that I remember.<br>At most it was a "that shouldn't be possible" before realising that it's the product of a RM</br></br></br>  <br> She should have B+. <br>No that would mean being nerfed only applies to ranks but it's the overall strength of a servant getting affected.<br> Blackened Servants lose that limitation, their fighting ability jumps significantly. <br>What limitation? The limitations only apply to people that can't supply fucking mana.<br> Arondight raises all parameters by a rank, and he is already all A. <br>He has two which aren't A. In any case like I said I don't know what would happen here as it was never made clear. EX is not based on power alone like the usual ranks, see Extra Rider for example.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Raising a rank is an increase by "10".<br>a "+" doubles the stat</br></br>  <br> believing what Rin says <br>She is Nasu's mouthpiece in fucking Fate for magic shit. Dude come on.</br></br>  <br>Yes I know, I posted this chart</br>  <br>Rin can explain what she knows. If she doesn't know something, she brings out the most reasonable theory, and she does this a lot of times in the VN.</br>  <br>Give me a single "theory" that was wrong.</br>  <br> No that would mean being nerfed only applies to ranks but it's the overall strength of a servant getting affected. <br>It seems like only the ranks are affected though. Every Servant that gets nerfed gets a hit to their stats ranks.<br><br> What limitation? The limitations only apply to people that can't supply fucking mana. <br>Limitations apply to everything.<br> Losing her limitations and gaining in one way more power than she had when she was alive, she is probably, without dispute, the strongest Servant. <br><br> He has two which aren't A. In any case like I said I don't know what would happen here as it was never made clear. <br>Luck goes up with Protection of the Fairies, which means Arondight raising the parameters by a rank would put him on EX to all stats but Mana. Which is bullshit, and sounds like complete wank. He would be unbeatable with those stats.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only rank after A is EX. So increasing a rank while having A becomes EX. From what I have seen, a lot of Servants gain the + modifier when they get a better Master, so maybe after A what comes is modifiers. If what comes is rank then that would mean Arondight Lancelot is EX in everything which is bullshit not even I as a Lancelotfag can accept.</br>  <br>If you count both F/Z boxes they made more than LL</br>  Oh go fuck yourself.<br><br>I hate Sakura so much.</br></br>  <br><br>Saying that Sakura was weaker than Shirou and not clarifying that it was the worms that weakened her. She should know that she has greater potential than Shirou by far.<br><br>Rider even has to tell her not to underestimate Sakura when she sneaks out right past her familiars on day 12.<br><br>Every other time you are right, and she knows what she is talking about.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Losing her limitations and gaining in one way more power than she had when she was alive, she is probably, without dispute, the strongest Servant. <br>This is from HF were Saber was nerfed to shit because of Shirou. Something similar was said when she was being hyped up in UBW after Rin became her master. Saber in the VN is suppose to be the strongest servant.<br><br> Which is bullshit, and sounds like complete wank. He would be unbeatable with those stats. <br>Like I said I am not sure what happens here. But the rank after A is EX. Do you not know that EX isn't only for power alone?</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: Shows only you remember  <br>Go home.</br>  <br>kaeru thread?</br>  <br>S2 fucking when?</br>   ITT:Characters only you remember <br>FTFY</br>  <br>I remember it too.</br>  Kaeru's episode was so fucking amazing.   the best anime Trigger ever made was made by a bunch of office ladies instead of their actual "creative" employees   <br>It's so ironic.</br>  <br>Do you mean the one where her mom started yelling at her during her broadcast?<br>Because that was the best episode by far.</br></br>  <br>So ironic it hurts.</br>  <br>Actually, it was written and directed by the CEO that also works on pretty much every single show.</br>  <br><br>That wasn't made by Trigger.</br></br>  It's so good, and the Line sticker pack is so perfect for memeing purposes.  <br>That was the single best moment in the series. It even topped the fujoshi's episode with her office fantasies.</br>  <br>Do you own it? I'd like those for reaction image purposes.</br>  <br>Trigger owns it, though.</br>  <br>It's only 50 cents so it was an instant buy.</br>  <br> implying office ladies aren't creative </br>  <br> that moment when you realize that the colored comments were being made by the other characters <br><br><br>Well Kaeru is creative, at the very least.</br></br></br></br>  <br> best anime trigger ever made <br> not pic related </br></br>  <br>Sometimes the best creative work is that which is designed in a vacuum, rather than being a historical survey of the tropes, idioms and archetypes that form the ongoing narrative of the medium. Creative staff tend to be too caught up in the defining characteristics of their medium that they become afraid to think outside of it.</br>  <br>If you like memes, sure.<br><br>But Turning Girls is the realest.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Talking girl was great and indeed best Trigger made.</br>    <br> Talking girl </br>  Crane is love  <br>left</br>  <br>She looks okay</br>  <br><br>Daijoubu.<br><br> milometer </br></br></br></br>  <br>Its like they dont even try to hide it, shameless.</br>  <br>What's wrong with marrying Kaga?</br>  Araki is a genius. What are your thoughts on the new Jojo chapter?  <br>he's wearing a womans shirt customised for breastfeeding</br>    WTF is with all the people with elf ears in part 6?  <br>His eyes actually look very similar to Crazy Diamonds' imo.</br>  <br>God I hate Tusk act 1 design so badly. It's so annoying.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1525<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1509:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1525 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>The alrighty part was not meant to be green texted, my bad.<br><br>Not OR, I think you did a decent job.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey anon heres your request.

Welcome to the drawthreads! It looks very cute. I'm glad you drew for me first!</br>  What does /a/ think of Aldnoah Zero? I'm thinking about picking it up.<br><br>Aldnoah Zero thread.</br></br>  <br>I don't either the problem is that the staff believes that their being sensible and realistic, and not understanding why everyone's calling bullshit.</br>  <br>I've never seen the staff talk about it being either of those things.</br>  <br>It seemed more like Slaine opened up once he realized that Inaho had visiting her had nothing to with her.</br>  <br>They were on the same answer. I was talking about a different question and answer from the exact same pamphlet.</br>  <br>It seemed like something changed when he learned that Asseylum had ignored Inaho the whole time, Slaine always was pretty good at reading people.</br></blockquote>]
