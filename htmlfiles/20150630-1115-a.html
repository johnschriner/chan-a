I mean, your family is your family. I can't imagine just picking up and leaving like it's nothing.</br>   Yuru Yuri <br> Yuyushiki <br> Yuuki Yuuna </br></br>  Escaped Aquarius' water trap by drinking it up<br>-- Fuu needed to mankai out of it<br><br>Drove 3 Vertexes out of the barrier solo<br>-- Sonoko needed 20 mankais to do the same<br><br>Why is Gin so based?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was adopted by the Washio family.</br>  <br>That's what adoption means, /a/non.</br>  <br>Well, to be fair Leo is way stronger than any of the others.</br>  <br> YrYr <br> YuYu <br> YuYuYu </br></br></br>    <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br>It's not the same thing though. Or at least it wouldn't be for me. Adoption because you have no family or they're dysfunctional and you can't stay with them is one thing. But, what, so you get a better standing in society? For a job? It's still bizarre to me. I'm going to chalk it up to cultural differences.</br>  <br>Happening!</br>  <br>You are likely to succeed if you try.</br>  <br><br>I finally managed to get the cat ver. in game so I could test it and fixed some mistakes and typos in the script, here's the latest version http://www.mediafire.com/download/1<wbr>9e5xceax56ffe6/script.dat.</wbr></br></br>  <br>It's a thing in pretty much every society except the modern day individualist West. A man of high status adopting someone as an heir, when the natural ones proved a disappointment, for example -- in those cases, the adoptee would often be an adult with a good track record. Like a CEO hiring in a replacement, really.</br>  <br>I'd hire them.</br>  <br> Drove 3 Vertexes out of the barrier solo <br> -- Sonoko needed 20 mankais to do the same <br>Based on what happened in the Vita game, Leo later fused with other Vertices and evolved to Cluster Leo (Nightmare form) so Sonoko actually had to solo at least 6 Vertices. Remember that Cluster Leo wiped out the entire Hero Club before they were able to trap it in the sealing ritual, and sealing function didn't exist back when Sonoko fought it.</br></br></br>  <br>Leo is broken.<br>I always wondered why that one in particular, is it because the Lion symbolizes kingship and power?</br></br>  <br> the adoptee would often be an adult <br>Yeah, but Tougou was 12 when she was adopted. I guess I'm just more sentimental than Washi.</br></br>  What if the teory about the returned offerings being parts of dead yuushas is correct and Karin last Mankai made her lose her taste and that's why when she met Sonoko she liked soy sauce gelato so much.  <br>She was around 10 years old, she said she was named Washio Sumi during the 2 years of lost memory because of sange.</br>  <br>That would explain why the recovery process took so long.<br>But it's most likely just us and Tougou overthinking again.</br></br>  <br>Karin didn't say she likes soy sauce gelato, she likes soy sauce udon which is pretty normal.</br>  <br>Karin said that she liked soy sauce udon in the first VN so that's unlikely, the soy sauce gelato thing with Sonoko was just a fanart.</br>    <br>Please tell me this isn't all.</br>  Cripple Homura did literally nothing wrong, preventing little girls being sent out as sacrifical lambs forever was sound thing to do.  <br>I clearly can't even with the timeline.</br>  I can't do it anymore.<br>I can't handle the wait.<br>These spoilers/partial scans are making me even more depressed.</br></br>  <br>it is just the last half page</br>  <br><br>I fucked up.</br></br>  <br>I know, I meant not everything he's gonna post.<br>Clearly I was too naive.</br></br>    <br>Do we have identification for which Vertexes were in each of the WaSuYu battles? -- some of the descriptions were fairly crazy, like the Visual Kei Vertex.</br>  Gloomy mood in here.  <br>IIRC they did say the name of eah one after the description.</br>  <br>These are the three Gin drove off.</br>  <br>What I'm meaning is, it was purely a matter of business on behalf of the adopting family. In Wasshi's case, getting a candidate Yuusha into an appropriately high-status family, for mutual benefit.</br>  <br>the image is from somewhere like twitter or so..</br>  <br>1st Battle: Aquarius<br>2nd Battle: Libra<br>3rd Battle: Capricorn<br>4th Battle: Cancer, Sagittarius and Scorpio<br>5th Battle: Virgo<br>6th Battle: Aries, Pisces, Leo and according the the Vita game Leo Starcluster</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And these are the ones from the final battle.<br>The middle one is a wrong illustration if I recall, as they've already defeated that one.</br></br>  <br>http://yuyuyu.wikia.com/wiki/Vertex<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Speaking of which.<br>What happened to Taurus and Gemini?</br></br>  <br>Too tired to translate this half page now but basically.<br> Tougou's the one who found the book, not Sonoko. <br> The diary was written starting from July 2015. <br>Last few sentences<br> So heroes already existed back in the old age huh... What a surprise, right? Yuuna. <br> ... <br> Yuuna, what's wrong? <br> ... <br> Yuuna? <br><br> AD 2015 30th July <br> Everything began from this day </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand the motivation for it perfectly. But for me it's the fact that she never seems to miss her family. Or maybe it's just something that's never addressed. Hence what I meant about me being sentimental.</br>  <br>Apparently they are first encountered in episode 5.</br>  At the assembly of the gods...<br><br> Zeus: Guys, I've got bad news. <br> Krishna: What is it? <br> Zeus: It seems that a bunch of the other gods have have gotten together and decided to end humanity for being dicks or something. <br> General uproar among the gods <br> Odin: Whaaaaat? That's not cool, man. I like humans, I like watching them in the shower in particular. <br> Coyote: This fearsome news, Zeus.  <br> Jade Emperor: What we do? <br> Zeus: Well, if we merge our power together, we turn into a magical tree to create a barrier around one island and save the people living there. Everyone else is fucked. Now I know that you all probably want to save the people of your own cultures... <br> Krishna: Japan <br> Odin: Yeah, it's gotta be Japan. <br> Coyote: Japan clear choice. <br> Jade Emperor: Japanese people, master race. My Chinese people smelly and gross by comparison.  <br> Zeus: Okay then, so we're all agreed that the cultures we are from can all just go die, but we'll save at least some of the Japanese? <br> All gods: Agreed. <br><br> Takahiro: And that's how all the filthy gaijins died, and the only culture left was that of Glorious Nippon. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Interesting.<br>Taurus' shape always catches me off-guard as we've seen so little of it.</br></br>  <br>Neat, I didn't even know we had a wiki</br>  <br>Even though the barrier is only around Shikoku, the world inside it is extremely huge, and the only way to leave it through the wall on the Seto sea.<br>I actually only noticed this recently, but Tougou mentions it during the final episode; that explains why they could still see the entire earth after chasing Leo's core that flew up above.<br><br>That could mean there are potentially still people living in other countries inside the barrier. The moment the tree formed, it might have saved most of the world's population unaware that they've been moved into an identical copy of their former world.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They say its only an island, not a continent. But the whole thing is incredibly confusing and inconsistent since its never clear exactly how much of humanity is still alive.</br></br>  I want a S2, if only for the fact that "Stardust Crusaders" makes me giggle.  <br>but there aren't many content in the wiki so please feel free to create new article and complete empty or halffilled sections there.</br>  <br> small but fast </br>  <br>Well, it's hard to imagine a tiny Island in Japan having all that technology while remaining self-sufficient.<br>I guess the tree's blessing is to be taken into account, but has nobody ever tried leaving the island during these 300 years?</br></br>  <br>Maybe some people did and maybe they were never seen again , as in they were eaten by the Stardusts. </br>  The location of where Nogi Wakaba were standing as described, photo taken and uploaded by people from 2ch  Itsuki voice actor's blog about nico live: http://s.ameblo.jp/kurosawa-tomoyo/<wbr>entry-12041357062.html?timestamp=14<wbr>35448527</wbr></wbr>  <br>*correction, not nico live, but the radio live report.<br><br>Also happy brithday for karin.</br></br></br>  <br> True Yuusha <br> Yumi is GOD <br> 80% Human <br>And that's all I can read, Tougou and Karin's are too small to make out.</br></br></br></br>  Does anyone know how many chapters this will be?    <br>Sonoko probably used her 20 mankais to go outside the barrier and destroy all the remaining vertexes. That was why they took another 2 years to attack again.</br>  <br> destroy all the remaining vertexes <br> any of the WaSuYu destroying anything but themselves <br>Anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Much better.<br>From left to right, that goes:<br> True Yuusha <br> Yumi is GOD <br> 80% Human <br> YOU WANT TO KILL ME RIGHT?! <br> Juri-san wasn't our friend <br><br> I think I'm missing some sort of inside joke for the last two still </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm the guy who obsessively edits the tvtropes page, I might give some life to the wiki since I have a week or so of free time.</br>  <br>Even Karin's VA is for bullying</br>  <br>No promises about the TL quality<br><br>The booklet is quite old, even looking at the censored date,<br>at the very least, it's from before the 99th year of the Era of the Gods.<br>And yet, how could such a Yuusha Record exist?<br>"Yuuna-chan, everyone, come here"<br>Tougou, calls the others before she gets confused on her own.<br>One of the Yuusha Club's 5 Tenets is 'If you're troubled, talk to someone'.<br>And so she showed them the booklet she'd found.<br><br>"Huh... I never knew about this book.<br>'Yuusha Record'... It's got the same name as my diary"<br>"So you're saying it's a diary written by a Yuusha?<br>Weren't you the first generation of Yuushas?"<br>"I don't know, but what's inside?"<br>"Whoa, that's a crazy amount of censorship"<br>"But look at this: The diary starts in July 2015"<br>"In other words, before the dawn of the Era of the Gods"<br>"Wow, my heart's racing"<br>"A concrete description that hadn't been blacked out - [text cut off]<br><br><br>Nogi Wakaba<br><br>"Nogi... Wakaba... My ancestor?<br>If they wrote the diary, does that mean my ancestor was a Yuusha?"<br>"Sonocchi, you're their descendant so you've got the same name as in the diary, right?"<br>"It's not a prank right? You look pretty surprised, Yuuna"<br>"..."<br>"Yuuna, are you ok?"<br>"..."<br>"Yuuna?"<br><br>30th July, 2015 CE<br>On that day, everything ----.<br><br> 'Yuusha Record vol 2' End</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 80% Human <br>What does it mean?</br></br>  <br>20% something else</br>  <br>Thanks anon!</br>  <br> On that day everything -- <br><br>God damnit</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if that 4koma chapter where Yuuna time travels and meets Wasshi and her team is turning out to be important...</br>  <br>I thought it was the other way around?</br>  <br>Oh yeah, my bad, it was. It's been a while since I read it.</br>  <br>So it had more purpose than to just generate cute Sumi/Yuuna fan art?</br>  <br>I have never wanted /ll/ as badly in my life.</br>  <br>So Yuuna seems to have entered in some kind of trance after seeing the dairy. Maybe Yuuna is having visions of what happened in NoWaYu.</br>  <br>During the nico lives they would all impersonate Togo's line to the vertex in ep11 in a really hammy way. Don't know about the last one.</br>  I knew I had at least one more Sumi/Yuuna image.  <br>Oh right.<br>That was the line she yelled at Leo to lure it into attacking the tree.</br></br>  <br>Imagine Yuuna giving a massage to young Sumi and Sumi then getting her first orgasm.</br>  <br>You know, Togo was one of the two, along with Fuu that recognized that she was having an orgasm when Yuuna was massaging her.<br>Itsuki and Karin didn't recognize it.</br></br>  <br>In my head I belive that Tougou started to masturbate after she met Yuuna and started to lust for her. Sumi was pure.</br>  <br>Massages don't just cause orgasms. It's physically impossible, unless your "massage" certain parts which I'm sure a bunch of teenage girls would never do.</br>    <br>Or your masseuse happens to be a god. Which is what happened here.<br>Yuuna's Godhand is one of the clues that she is more than human.</br></br>  <br> just the last page <br>What manner of cruel torture is this?</br></br>  <br>nice clit bump shadow</br>  <br><br><br>You people are forgetting that the official story is that everything outside Shikoku has been contaminated by a deadly virus.</br></br></br>  <br>If people can get off solely on nipple play, I don't see why you can't get a similar effect with other parts of the body. Do you even know how orgasms work? Bodies aren't machines that only turn on with specific power buttons.</br>  Has season 2 been confirmed?  <br>July 30th</br>  <br>Nice! That's the same month of my birthday!</br>  <br>damn. That had me fooled for a moment that Ume-sama had drawn a Yuyuyu art.</br>  <br>AAAAAH</br>  <br>Would Ume be contractually obligated not to draw rival magical girls?<br><br>If I saw an Ume YuYuYu doujin I could die happy</br></br></br>  <br>She can draw whatever she wants.</br>      <br>Tougou-vision sure is bright</br>  <br><br>Don't you have actual screenshots from the show? these gave me eye canceer</br></br>  <br><br>Since Togo had forgotten she was a miko, did she mistake the feeling of Yuuna's aura of divinity for romantic love?</br></br>  <br>Those are screen shots.</br>    <br>Was that a total non-sequitur or are alpha waves going to be important now?</br>    <br>I think that Tougou's just silly.<br><br>One of the things that I liked about YuYuYu is that the standard black-haired lesbian girl was just as silly as everybody else.</br></br></br>    I want to make Tougou an idol.  <br>I want to make Umi a hyper-nationalist.</br>  I want to overcome East Asia with song and dance with Mimorin.  I want to join Mimori's co-prosperity sphere.  Silly Tougou &gt; Wasshi~ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; apocalyptic Tougou  <br>Silly Wasshi, in other words, best girl will soon arrive.</br>  <br>Apocalyptic Tougou has her own charm.</br>    Looks like nipps can't be counted upon.<br>We'll just have to wait for the anon that ordered his physical copy to arrive.</br>  <br>did it leave Japan yet?</br>  <br>Wait. Did Togo just rush across the street in her jammies and storm into Yuuna's bedroom?</br>  <br>My copy is due to arrive tomorrow/the day after tomorrow yet it still hasn't left Japan. Guess I won't get it this week, dunno about other anons.</br>  <br>I want to believe</br>  <br>She can rush in Yuuna's room in less than 10 seconds, no need to get change.</br>  <br>She said in the 2nd VN she can get from her room to Yuuna's in 10 seconds.</br>  <br>Let's learn Japanese!<br><br>The only words in this comic are<br><br>Good night<br>Togo-san<br>Yuna-chan<br>Yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>meant to </br>  <br>There's also ガラ and だき</br>    <br>What are the odds Yuuna and Tougou-san kiss before Yuuna's eventual and obvious demise/ascension?</br>  <br>Yuuna is not a god, Tougou will save her this time to mirror the ending of the previous season</br>  <br>Wakaba sure was handsome. Soon, we'll have to reorder our handsomeness rankings again. Watch out, Gin!</br>      <br>Dammit Wakaba!<br><br> Just enjoying saying Dammit Wakaba! again, it was the best part of the Vividred threads when the show was airing </br></br></br>    <br>You need to leave something for after she comes back with KONJOU again.</br>  <br>Wakaba somewhat looks like a mix of a middle school bully and an elegant yamato nadeshiko. I wonder what kind of personality she's going to have.</br>  <br>That expression tells me she's gonna be like old Sumi.<br>No-fun allowed minus the retard moe.</br></br>  <br> inb4 she's a total baka that only looks cool when she poses for photos </br>  <br><br>What if she only looks like a badass but it's only how her face defaults to and she's too socially inept to know how to express herself?</br></br>  <br><br>That could work.</br></br>      is scan already out?  <br> 30th July, 2015 CE <br> On that day, everything ----. </br></br>  <br>Actually, it's more like<br> It all started on that day </br></br>  <br>Quick, move to Shikoku if you want to live.</br>   Zzz   <br>Looks like we're back to suffering</br>    <br> dat filename <br>No.<br>Whatever you say Yuuna-chan is simply MY YUUNA-CHAN, MY HERO and my BEST FRIEND. <br>I'm not gonna believe anything else.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tougou pls.<br><br>You'll wake it up</br></br></br>  another illustration , uploader unknown  <br>is she writing a love letter to her boyfriend?</br>  <br>Will we ever get a proper scans of this?<br><br><br> dat smug <br> dat Itsuki <br>Too much  girl power </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not really worried about Tougo and Yuuna because they hint that they're going to be daijobu.<br><br>I'm really, really worried about other Yuushas though</br></br></br>      We need high quality translation  <br>Damn, Wakaba looking fine there.<br><br>Based on the expression there, she''ll probably be the no-bullshit hardass samurai type. I just finished Symphogear G so Tsubasa comes to mind.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>over 90 pages is the LN or is a large part also Illustrations and interviews?</br></br></br>  I can't decide if I love Tougou's hyper nationalism or not  <br>The expression on Yuuna's face is very foreboding.</br>  <br><br><br>キターーーーーーーーーー！！！<br>HYPE HYPE HYPE</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it just a few pages in a magazine that has lots of other LNs as well?</br></br>  <br>It's from the fanbook that just got released.</br>  Dead  <br><br>for those who have missed it here it is the cover scan</br></br>  <br><br>Gin died<br><br>I cried</br></br></br></br>  <br>I started watching the show again for the first time since it finished airing yesterday. I got choked up during<br>the fucking<br>OP<br> literally traumatised </br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how many anons will cry when we see Wakaba and the other 5's deaths.</br>   MLA glorious battle end <br> F/Z revelation of despair and suffering end <br> Yuuna punches everything to daijoubu (again) end <br>Which one, /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>If this page of the 4koma is anything to go buy, Tougou'll be the one beamspam things into daijoubu this time, something will be lost in the process though.</br>  <br>Anyone translating these already, or should I take a stab at it?</br>  <br>W-why are they blushing? Where is Tougou's hand going?<br><br><br>Please go for it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>please do it</br>  <br>Be a Hero, anon</br>  <br>It's kind of jarring that Tougou's sleeping with Yuuna yet she still doesn't take of Sonoko's ribbon.</br>  <br>The fact that she's in love with Yuuna doesn't mean she can't appreciate Sonocchi's friendship</br>  <br>Yuuna doesn't like it, though, see episode 7 where she changed Tougou's hairstyle. And you're supposed to take off your hair ties when going to sleep.</br>  <br>MLA is the better one<br>But i like Yuuna's more<br>F/Z one is boring since it wasn't a surprise</br></br></br>  They need to release the character songs already. I want to know what exactly is going on in Yuuna's mind.  <br>MLA-level of final battle would be as glorious as it'd be horrifying. I'm not sure my heart can take it</br>  <br>I feel you. I am as much hyped for the character songs as I am for NoWaYu.</br>  <br>I can already see it. The other Yuushas in their death throes, begging for Tougou the last surviving one to just blast them all to hell together with the Vertex and end this wretched world. The irony would be excruciating.</br>  <br>Subconsciously claiming her woman.</br>  <br>Post Traumatic Stress reaction it seems like- but where would she have seen this girl before?<br>Well other than the doppleganger standing right in front of her.</br></br>  <br>nope it is from yuyuyuVFB</br>  I didn't realize that these pages were posted out of order, so I translated  first only to realize it was the last page.<br><br>Here's  this page, which goes over Karin's sleepover at Sonoko's and Fuu's thoughts of succession.<br>http://pastebin.com/y7qzvCjU</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, keep it up</br>  <br> Karin practically confirmed for next president <br>This is going to be wild.</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon!<br> "Nibosshi, you're cuter with your hair down, huh~ That's so lovely~" <br>Sonocchi and I have the same taste</br></br></br>   <br> Karin acting all embarrassed when complimented <br>My heart can't take it.</br></br>  <br>Fuu thought about it already inside her head in the 2nd VN.</br>  <br><br>I'm gonna be in Japan on the 22nd. Do you think I'll be able to survive the first week of happening?</br></br>  <br>Next season is practically confirmed to have a timeskip, huh. Can't wait for grown up Itsuki.</br>  <br>Vertices are due to return in 2-3 years. If they do a 2 years time skip then Itsuki'll be left out so I guess they'll go for a 3 years one. <br>That said, I wonder if Yuuna can even last 3 years without turning into something else.</br></br>  <br>Well, there is another hint that Itsuki x Karin might be a real thing.<br><br>But for Fuu to consider anyone but Sonoko as her replacement is ridiculous. Wonder what the Taisha are going to say when they see this.</br></br></br>  <br>Would they really mind? Karin's the one who's always kept a pretty level head and never really gave up on fighting for the Taisha.</br>  <br>Making Karin club president is the ultimate in bullying.</br>  <br>While Sonoko was the one who actually figured out how to defeat the Vertex.</br>  <br>and also refused to fight for them when Tougou did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>She's too much of a dork to handle normal club's activities, though. Remember that they're choosing people to be a club head, not a squad captain.</br>  <br>So the Taisha will ignore it and send all messages on military matters to Captain Nogi?</br>  Not much info from G's Mag.  <br>Yes. In fact, in the above untranslated part of the new chapter, Sonoko regularly frequents to Taisha HQ to get more information, with her status, she can dig up more things than Fuu and Karin can ever do.</br>  <br>Is she going to come at Vertex with just the katana?<br>That's pretty hardcore, even if the blade is grorious.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Ok, which is it? 2015 or 2018?</br></br></br>  <br>It says 2015 right on the page.</br>  <br>Diary was written from 2015, the above text is in 2018. There's probably a time skip.</br>  <br> the above text <br>I meant the short description in the magazine.</br></br>  <br>The attack most likely started in 2015, but the yuushas didn't counterattack until 2018</br>  <br><br>From July 30th 2015 to July 30th 2018? It's weird to see a time skip that last exactly 3 years.</br></br>  I want to download the soundtrack for this, but there seem to be two on nyaa? halp  <br>There's 2 soundtracks</br>  <br>That helps. Thanks!</br>  <br>One soundtrack came out before show ended, another came out with 5th BD.</br>  <br><br><br>Okay, here are all three pages.<br>http://pastebin.com/mvYSk5YL</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon!</br>  <br>Thanks, based anon.</br>  <br>I love you anon! Thank you so much!</br>  <br>You are a hero!</br>  <br><br>This always bothers me, whenever there's more of them together and they're talking randomly you often enough have to guess who said what because the text doesn't make that clear.</br></br>  <br> Sonoko still secretly plotting things for the greater good <br>This is the best.</br></br>  <br>You are a true yuusha anon</br>  <br>It's a little more clear in the Japanese text.<br>Itsuki uses more -ne's<br>Tougou uses more -wa's, more kanji, and no loanwords<br>Sonoko uses squiglies<br>Fuu speaks like a combination of a dude and an old lady.<br>They also use different personal pronouns and nicknames.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuu speaks like a combination of a dude and an old lady. <br><br>Don't know why but this made me laugh.</br></br></br>  <br>When I read<br> Everything awesome from the last thread: <br>I thought you linked every Karin picture in the last thread.</br></br></br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>There's a reason she has mostly boy's power and mother's power</br>  <br>Fuu's mother power is off the charts in that picture</br>  <br>I wish I could vocalize squiglies.</br>  <br>Drop periods, make the end of your sentence trail into the distance.</br>  <br>Which Yuuna?</br>  <br>both in the same time</br>  <br>Great job anon.<br> Even though I was supposed to do it, I overslept. </br></br>  btw, 4koma  <br>Is anyone translating the 4koma?

You mean you've known about us all along? <br><br> I've noticed you since morning, when I was eating my raw egg udon at the usual shop, sneezed and had udon come out of my nose~ <br><br> ...Actually <br> I've only started following you after noon <br> (yup) <br><br> ... <br> I've noticed you from the time you started stalking me past noon~ <br> She casually corrected herself!! <br><br><br>Easy peasy!<br> (What really happened?) <br> (I sent her a text) <br> Anyways Nogi Sonoko! <br><br> I don't care if you were a hero first, I'm not gonna approve of you so easily!! <br> Fight me!! <br><br> I can't do such a thing with a friend~ <br><br> (Karin-chan's so easy) <br> (Easy peasy) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Overflowing<br> I'll be in your care from here on~ <br> W-when you put it that way <br><br> I'm glad things worked out in the end <br> The win goes to Sonocchi <br> ? <br><br>That night<br> Oh boy~ <br> Nibosshi-chan's tsundere act stimulates my writing appetite~ <br>Nogi Sonoko.<br>Hobby: Writing novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://twitter.com/onigirinigirime<wbr></wbr></br>  <br> I want to know what exactly is going on in Yuuna's mind. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cJU<wbr>eqKpReOk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Seriously, the amount of heroic content involving yuuna is lacking, I want to see her singing a shonen opening about heroism and punching</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Yuuna crying because she was moved by the picture book or because she was jealous of Tougou praising Sonoko?</br>  <br>Stupid sexy Fuu<br><br><br>Thanks!</br></br></br></br>  Thank you, 4koma translator. Now we can properly bask in Sonoko's glory.  <br>Oh right I forgot to translate the title of the book.<br>It's "The carpenter and the Calico cat'.<br><br>http://hukumusume.com/douwa/English<wbr>/jap/01/17a_E.html</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks! but do you mind translating the vertical running text to the right of this particular page too?</br>  <br>Please look forward to Nogi Sonoko-sensei's next work!</br>    <br>fat</br>  <br>I'd let Yuuna eat me.</br>  I hope Togo dies in season 2 but everyone else lives and forgets her.  <br>What the fuck man.</br>    <br>I hope you die in season 2.</br>  <br> cat cures its owners' disability by taking it into itself <br>TAKAHIRO YOU CHEEKY BASTARD</br></br>  <br>That is not nice</br>  <br> ゆーゆ <br> Yu-yu <br>NO! THIS IS WRONG! I DEMAND THIS BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY!<br><br>In Japanese, the ー sound means an extended vowel, so it's pronounced Yuuyu. This is NOT what - means in English, it is a hyphen and used to "join words and to separate syllables of a single word", hence, Yu-yu is pronounced as if the "yu" syllables are of equal length and with a short gap in-between them, as in "yo-yo". These are two COMPLETELY different things.<br><br>Sorry, I know translating is a lot of work and you put lots of effort in for free, solely out of the goodness of your heart to help us, and this is an incredibly minor thing that I'm complaining about. BUT IT IS WRONG! FIX IT AT ONCE!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>She's a terrible person and doesn't deserve being friends with good people. Yuuna especially should abandon her.</br></br></br>  I really wish Sonoko and Tougou come out and tell everyone about Gin.<br>This teasing is killing me.<br>Fuu's  line was exactly what Gin said to Tougou way back, and every time she's being hinted at I die a little inside.</br></br>  <br>She is not a good person, but she's effective on the side of good and also enables Yuuna to be her best. Wanting her dead is just going backwards.</br>  <br>Seriously nigger? Just read the original Japanese text then and quit bitching.</br>  <br>Yuuna is better off without her. Togo does nothing but ruin shit.</br>    <br>Jealous?</br>  <br>Sad.

Literally, because nothing's been confirmed. </br>  <br>I will end you</br>  <br>As expected. It all went wrong when the domestic abuse of Tougou started</br>  <br>None of them but Togo and Karin are gay.<br><br><br>Yuuna never loved Togo and her crush is repulsive. Yuuna would puke.<br><br><br>But anon, I do hate Togo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Itsuki makes everything more cute.</br>  <br>The thing that always get me is that they never put Yuuna as the card that Yuuna literally references herself and reenacts in the last episode</br>  <br>Itsuki-chan maji tenshi.</br>  <br>Which would be?</br>    NESSAAAA HENNNA KORE HASSA EEEEHHHHHHHHH EHHHHHHH <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d_j<wbr>SDVXwSO8</wbr>  [ ] <br><br> this is the best ost and you can't prove it i'm wrong </br></br></br></br>   About half is done.

In Zexal Kaito establish this against Jinlong and saying something like strong duelist guide their cards. In GX manga, Judai's luck affect even his opponent's draw (that Angel almost defeat him if she draw a monster card). <br><br>Then we have Jounouchi who, well, gamble. That's why Kaiba dissed him so hard. But I do love it when he and Valor beat the shit out of each other. We were like "is this a card game anymore?"

It was stated once (before Yuya duels him) that he beats LDS students on a consistent pace.<br><br>Correct me If I'm wrong.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dont worry Yuya will get Rin</br></br>  <br>Almost all yugioh girls when they hit like 16 get huge tits.</br>    <br>HOPE</br>  <br>no</br>  is this lewd  <br>Missed her left shoulder.</br>  I feel bad for Rin. It must be hard taking care of an idiot like Yugo.  <br>I feel more sorry for Yuzu and Ruri. Look at how emo Yuya gets without Yuzu around and how edgy her brother and maybe crush got when she got kidnapped.</br>  That prison has to be the most unprofessional prison of all time.<br>I mean forgetting you have a break out only because you saw some rare cardo.<br>How did they seriously keep someone in there for 10 years?</br></br>    <br><br>lel</br></br>  You faggots better stop or else.  <br>Or else what?</br>  yuuya~  <br>Fujoshit please leave</br>  <br>i'm 18 episodes in and while the anime is pretty good it's primarily yuya that i'm watching it for</br>  <br><br><br> DELETE THIS </br></br></br>  <br> Almost all yugioh girls when they hit like 16 get huge tits. <br><br>Despair</br></br></br>    <br>To be fair LDS students are Arc-V's obelisk blues. Well, except for the actual Obelisk Blues, but you get my meaning.</br>  <br>also is yuuya: blue haired edgemaster edition meant to come off as a creepy stalker or</br>  <br><br>Really though, try to name one girl that isn't 15-16+ in yugioh that doesn't have big tits.</br></br>  Friendly reminder that Yuzu hasn't seen Yuya's edge mode yet.  <br>Yugi's mom.</br>  <br>shun</br>  <br>He seems to have been cured of it ever since he entered synchro, though. I wonder if hopping dimensions has had anything to do with it or it's simply the thirst for Yuzu overwhelming all other feelings.</br>  <br>personally I'm hoping for edge mode reveal and then Yuzu curing it by hugs and  hand holding. </br>  <br>She's one of the few, now try prominent characters that show up consistently. <br><br>She saw it when he dueled Ryouzanpaku.<br><br>Hmmm</br></br></br></br></br>  Academia invasion when?  <br>Arc-V is the anti-Zexal<br> No lewds <br> Likeable protagonist <br> Important female lead <br> Several relevant females <br> Parents that actually matter <br> Rival with little screentime <br> Uses several summon methods instead of BUY XYZ <br> Uses tons of references to previous series instead of pretending it doesn't exist <br> Side-characters actually do stuff and are interesting <br> Social commentary </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She saw it when he dueled Ryouzanpaku. <br><br>That was just a hint of it. That wasn't full DARK AURA YUYA</br></br></br>    <br>She wont see it either because he'll go EGAO 2, Bright Eyes Yugo/Yuto addition.</br>  <br>I just noticed the figure in the poster is suposed to be an Obelisk Force</br>  <br>I think it was this one:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sfu<wbr>JChScFcU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Well, it sorta was, I mean, he had the crazy eyes and hair and everything, unless you only count the extra edge mode he got when he first summoned OERD as the true Yami Yuya.</br>  <br> dat Asuka and Aki <br><br>Hnnnnng<br><br>Is there a universal law where YGO girls have to be fucking amazing?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YES thank you!</br>  <br>So they've invaded Synchro before? Leo did mention something about not wanting to deploy more forces to Synchro until were 100% done with XYZ, maybe they sent some smaller forces that were repelled? The invasion might even have been a justification for the pseudo fascist classist thing they've got going on.</br>  <br>The posters were made by Yuzu and Yugo (probably Yuzu since Yugo is quasi-illiterate)</br>  <br>Yuzu and Yugo were the ones who made the posters, and they know what Obelisk look like from encountering them during the Battle Royale. The average Synchro citizen has no idea about different dimensions and thinks the idea of dimensional invaders is silly.</br>  <br><br><br>Ah, I se, thanks. So Yugo and Yuzu are like the crazy guy in the corner with the "Jesus is coming" sign, and Jean Mitchell is just an asshole that doesn't even need propaganda to justify his police state.</br></br></br>  <br>I've always wondered how Domino City got as terrible as it was. I'm sure Kaiba doesn't care, but where is everyone else at that lets that shit happen.</br>  <br>Man, Asuka is top fucking tier when she's in clothes that arent ugly like the Obelisk Blue girls uniform</br>  Do you take responsibility?  <br>We don't know how many, if any, characters from DM and GX might have died in the unspecified timeskip between series and/or on Zero Reverse. In any case given that Jack was Kingu and that he didn't have to duel Yugi for the title as far as we know is pretty telling of the fact that the DM characters weren't really influential anymore (Not that a Yugi, being merely a champion game player, even if that game is as popular as both kinds of football puth together in our world, could have stopped the onset of the dystopia, as you said, Kaiba wouldn't have cared and he's the only one who realistically could have done something about it)</br>  <br>Of course it's real! He created a themepark of death just to try and kill Yugi.<br><br> Though I think it just maybe solid vision with mass though </br></br></br>  <br>BATHTIME!</br>  <br><br>ultra kek</br></br>  <br>Yes. Then I go and take responsibility for the other Ruris too.</br>  <br> No lewds <br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br>You really want those Dragon dicks up your ass don't you?</br>  <br>Well KaibaCorp is the one that made Duel Runners and Ushio was in DM as a high school bully. So I'd imagine everyone in DM is still alive.</br>    <br> No lewds <br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br>Yugi may have well retired in those 20+ years and have assented to legendary duelist status. As for Kaiba, Yliaster coukd have forced him or Mokuba out of KC or killed them to take full control of the company and wrap it to what it became.</br>  <br> didn't change the bracelet <br>1/10</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding? You can learn everything you need to know in life by playing card games! At least, that's what Crow taught me.</br>  <br>Holy fuck I shit you not I was so focused on the yuzus It took me fucking 5 minutes to notice what was behind her.</br>    <br>Ushio is an exception and a temporal anomaly. Some suspect him to be immortal as a result of his penalty game.</br>  <br>Also, Zexal was hated in the west and loved in Japan, while Arc-V is loved in the west and- what do the Japanese think of Arc-V?<br>Is it more popular than Zexal?</br></br>  <br>japanese have bad taste</br>  <br>Well his name was on a list in GX too with the whole Nightshroud/Domino City stuff.</br>  <br>Japan seems to like Arc-V quite a lot. I think they just like YGO man.</br>  <br> Shun <br>Every revolutionary time</br></br>  <br> that determined for cock Yuzu </br>   sexualizing the yuzu   <br>Taking the sleeves off of the obelisk blue uniform was a stupid idea.</br>  <br>I approved of the attempt at bare upper arm service, but it didnt work out</br>  <br>I prefer that before we get DMG sexualization again. Unless they use another monster of course, but stop with the fagging of DM things.</br>  <br>Dark Magician Girl legs in good animation in the waifufag times. Oh yes.</br>  <br> &gt;sexualizing the yuzu <br>kek</br></br>  <br>anon yuya is going to be jealous</br>  <br>And I would appreciate it if it wasn't the fact that she literally has some kind of apparition in every Yu-Gi-Oh! Seasons, DM being her first appearance, GX and that Duel Spirit Monster Day, 5Ds with that figure Carly got and the movie, and ZEXAL with the stones, and probably she will have some type of appearance in Arc-V. Not counting the many figures she has plus the new one.<br>I don't say that is bad, she is likeable, but it's obvious the really nostalgia bait for DM, and DMG is with Atem one of the most noteable things in there, so instead of that I will really prefer have things from other seasons, hell I'll take even ZEXAL even if it was a big punch of balloliness.</br></br>  <br>Woah nigga das lewd.</br>  <br>All it took was sealing Yoshida away into the Zexal Manga.<br>He needs a new containment unit</br></br>   Serena will never be loved by her Yuu.    miera disappointed that yuya was "her fated person" <br>sis get better opinions</br>  <br>Man, she's going to be so fucking happy when she sees Yuya duel JAKKU</br>  <br>Good she has her boy harem of Reiji, Shun, and Sawatari now.</br>  <br>She's gonna be so disappointed when he gets his asshole ripped apart so hard by the Kingu that he turns gay and wants to start sucking his dick for how amazing he is.</br>  <br>Nah, Yuya's going to be I WANT TO RESTORE THAT SMILE.</br>  <br>And the Kingu is gonna be all "I still don't care."</br>   http://ygorganization.com/awildbel<wbr>ialappears/</wbr> <br><br>Hot Red Dragon Archfind Belial confirmed for HSR, and we get a mysterious monster that's probably the third theme.<br>We ain't getting Goyos</br></br></br>  I'm at the part where Yubel possesses Napoleon's autistic kid, and I'm not gonna lie, I miss Edo, I miss his quest to find the D.  <br>Edo is clearly Reiji's grandfather. <br><br> Edo: D <br> Leo: D/D <br> Reiji: D/D/D <br><br>Just look at the two, they're related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whether you like it not Yuya will make him EGAO soon enough</br>  <br>Bless your sweet innocent heart. Keep watching.</br>  <br> no Speedroids <br> no Goyo <br> Psychic shit <br><br>The fuck are you doing Konami really...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I vote Arc-V manga. Something something equivalent exchange.</br>  <br>Leo having a banished focus deck when?</br>  <br><br>I appreciate the effort on these Yuzu edits but the anatomy is really fucking with me.</br></br>  <br> no Speedroids  <br>But they are right fucking there</br></br>  I want to rewatch Protag vs Rival duels (not just the main rivals) DM-Zexal. Which single duels vs each rival are the best (e.g. which Yugi vs Kaiba duel was the best)?  <br>You know this whole set is about 40 synchro slots long right?</br>  <br> no Speedroids <br>How can someone be this retarded?</br></br>  <br><br> Yugi vs Kaiba <br>I'd say their duel in duelist kingdom, but since it goes by DK rules I'm gonna say their Battle City Semi Final battle<br> Judai vs Kaiser <br>Their final duel when Kaiser graduates<br> Yusei vs Jack <br>Their final duel<br> Yuma vs Kaito <br>Their first duel<br> Yuya vs Reiji <br>Their duel at the end of Battle Royale</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No surprises there. Goyo Guardian is still banned in OCG. There's no way Japan would release superior versions of Goyos before unbanning the vanilla Goyo.<br><br>Makes me wonder why the anime shills Goyos in the first place though</br></br></br></br>  <br> but since it goes by DK rules I'm gonna say their Battle City Semi Final battle <br>I re-watched that the other day, shit was so cash. DM era duels could be obscenely long, but that one made it work, all the back and forth and Kaiba development.</br></br>  <br><br>You need to stop posting this filth.</br></br>  <br>You're right, we need some chubby Ruri</br>  <br><br>The color needs to be toned down a little more</br></br>  <br>Yeah. Of course there are groups who like one or two series more than the others, but in general there's a lot of love for all the series in nippon.</br>  Performapals are so fucking fun.<br>Joker, Secondonkey and Wizard give the deck ridiculous search power.<br>And Secondonkey is a lot easier to recycle than Joker with Bowhopper</br></br>  <br>This is starting to get out of hand. Being willing to ditch your comrades in a place like a prison for the sake of a waifu is a thing antagonists do, Yuya.</br>  <br>I'd imagine Ruri's hair will be a tad different than the inverted colors, it's just odd seeing piss yellow and diarrhea brown. Also isn't Rin's hair a different shade of green slightly too?</br>  <br> Only one of those three actually got their guy </br>  This is not Meshi  <br>All of them have slightly lighter colors than what you see in the inversed image. The designers will probably exercise their artistic freedom to make Ruri's hair a bit more yellow than inverse Serena, but not by that much.</br>  <br>Does Aki have a motherfucking whip behind her back? Im  not opposed to it <br>Wish the artist would do Yuzu in this style, its qt</br></br>  Did we already get speculation from the episode out of our system already?  <br>Well there was a couple shades/filters edited in to show it was a flashback, so Rin's hair might be darker than it actually looks like.</br>  <br><br>Well you need to inverse the brightness but otherwise the hair color is pretty much exactly the inverted color</br></br>  <br>This is not Egao</br>  <br>i paused at the miera duel for now because i couldn't handle yuya<br>whatever evil force animated that episode must have wanted to torture teenage girls everywhere</br></br>  <br><br><br>This is my guess based on what we've got, but they'll probably just do something that looks good.</br></br></br>  <br>Ruriographer?</br>  <br> Invuris </br>  <br>Yuya is one cute kid.</br>  <br> professional ruri graphing <br>How is this marvelous branch of science called?<br>Where can I study it?</br></br></br>  <br> In Heartland. </br>  <br>understatement of the century</br>  <br> yfw Asuka is teaching people at Academia out of her annoyance </br>  <br>Serena's hair seems to vary. It some things it appears a midnight purple/blue, other times it's blue.</br>  <br> no private lessons with Asuka </br>  <br>That looks like it's just multiplied in Paint Tool Sai, which would explain the color discrepancy.</br>  <br> Multiply. <br> Not overlay. </br></br>  so how exactly did yuya's dad first create action dueling anyways? did he just throw magic cards everywhere before a random match and pick them up mid game while calling it action magic?  <br>He worked with Akaba Leo.</br>  <br>oh damn i'm not there yet<br>guess i'll shut up until i catch up</br></br>  <br>I TAKE MY LEVEL 4 YUZU AND MY LEVEL 4 SELENA AND CONSTRUCT THE OVERLAY NETWORK<br><br>XYZ SHOUKAN!</br></br></br>  <br>Don`t think that was ever said, probably a safe assumption. I like to think he just dueled while hopping around and interacting with his monsters while everybody just wondered what the fuck was he doing</br>  <br> not overlaying all the Ruris at once </br>  <br>No, it requires that you overlay Yuzu, Serena, and Rin to construct the Imouto Network to XYZ summon Ruri like true RuriRaptors.</br>  What are ideas for a new summoning method as Arc-V obviously isn't the last anime?

OHIO  In this situation, what should a man go for and remove first ? <br>Her top, or her panties ?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358108   <br>Her top.</br>  <br>Kuro, I keep telling you to call me Otou-san...</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358108 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358129 <br>2015 /a/ is awful.</br></br>  <br>A real man would take her panties off first.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358108 <br>Shes legal<br>I hope</br></br>    <br>Neither. You just facefuck her until you cum and then go back to sleep</br>    <br>Maybe in isis controlled territory and under the sharia</br>  <br>She's not, even by Japanese law. <br><br>But she's not real either, so who cares ?</br></br></br>  Whats with the normalfags getting triggered over 2d loli?<br><br>Who the fuck cares about the age of a fucking cartoon?</br></br>  Shhhh, anon is sleeping.  <br>Yup, I want to bury my face in that.</br>  <br>Panties, there is nothing under that top</br>  <br>I would remove nothing because Kuro is unsexy</br>  I'm so ready for Herz.  <br>Shitposters. Ignore them. They live off the attention and coming into threads telling other people what they don't like.</br>  PUFFY<br>U<br>F<br>F<br>Y</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why remove? Do it through the panties</br>    Is the anime actually decent?<br><br>Should I read/watch/play anything before?</br></br>  <br>I want to fuck Illya in public and make all the normies watch!</br>  <br>How'd you get in my bed?

That's so wrong. Archetype:Earth should not be looking so submissive.</br>  <br>Why she looks fatter or the left picture?</br>  <br>anon, shut up! I liked your smell...</br>    <br> Promotes the real crime againts children. <br>There is literally 0 scientific evidence to back up that claim. It's the same logic as "violent video games cause violent crime".</br></br>  Are futons actually comfy?  <br>Yeah right, because 3DPD child's look like illya or kuro.</br>  <br> normalfags logic <br><br>I don't understand why you guys keep coming to /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> A cute little tummy and a delicious flat chest which dark brown nipples long to be nibbled on.  <br> "Nothing". </br></br>  <br>panties of course.<br>There's nothing of worth under that top.</br></br>  <br>But otaku lose their boners if a woman looks even remotely non-submissive, no matter her personality. It's the same reasoning as that behind mindbreak.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AfS<wbr>IDrMR3cw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> this whole post </br>  <br> then bury your face in her dripping panties </br>  <br>You would remove the panties first and push the top up during the act.</br>  <br>the condom wrapper</br>  <br> not ravaging her raw <br>what is wrong with you anon</br></br>  <br><br> they don't want to lick her cute tummy while playing her erected nipple <br><br>Fags not welcome here.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>You are 11 lines mad.</br>  <br>Too bad 3D children are fucking ugly.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>Damn you are butt blasted</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>This has to be bait.</br>  <br> armpits are accessible as is <br><br>C, final answer.</br></br></br>  <br> not keeping a collection of all the semen you unloaded inside lolis <br><br>do you even pedo?</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>lmao</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>He mad.</br>  <br> pedo <br>I hate this meme.</br></br>  <br>They're just summerfags, ignore them.</br>  <br> its a matter of time you end trying heroine or crack. <br><br>Nah man, my chinese cartoons told me that a single joint can turn a normal person into a insane serial killer.</br></br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749   <br>This has been happening long before summer started buddy.</br>  <br> It's like marihuana, when you start smoking it, its a matter of time you end trying heroine or crack. <br><br>Yeah and masturbation makes you deaf overtime.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749   <br>I'd rather a collection of my and Kuro's babies.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>Today is a turning point, the beginning of a new vision. Our aim is to transcend the metaphor, and reach true philosophy. <br>This is a declaration of war, a deliberate move in order to reinstate a truly peripherical point of view. We reconstruct the veracity as we speak, pertaining to its original value. A neologism, that will imprint its mark of true significance, is born. In these words you will not find solace : exhale, and believe. This revolution will carry no message, and yet bear fruits of vindication. Such is the path of he who is truly blessed. Each iteration has known its conflict, each division its veneration. Through our effort, we pray to obtain senseless volition. <br>Only thus can sense be made, and dereliction exposed as deception. <br>As we have our kek, so do we eat it, fully conscious of our struggle. <br><br>I, anon, will deliver.<br>For I will be here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like lolis who are older than me.</br>  Please stop replying to pasta.<br>https://archive.moe/_/search/text/E<wbr>very%20time%20I%20see%20a%20%20thre<wbr>ad%2C%20I%20just%20shake%20my%20hea<wbr>d%20and%20laugh./</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Too many people fall for the bait.</br>  I wish mods-kun would stop leaving for 1 hours everytime.<br><br>This is /a/ and we need NEET mods already.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358129 <br> those hips <br> pedophilia <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>But i'm a little girl, h-how did this happen?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>nice pasta</br>  <br>Well too bad you get mods that don't watch anime and are bronies.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127359062 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>You must be living a very sad life.</br></br>  Any yuri heavy shows besides Prisma this Summer?  <br> bronies <br>Gonna need proof of that, anon.</br></br>  Are Narutards this mad that they have to ruin other threads?  <br>Yuri undertones in NNB and expect yuri undertones in the kirara manga adaptations.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127359062 <br>That picture is incorrect, Canada is a lot stricter with lolis than America, but what would you know shitposter-kun.</br>  <br>Based mods.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>Fun fact: Lolicons are the biggest normalfags on /a/. Many of them have jobs, lives and friends. That is why /l/ is so dead on weekends while normalfag shitposting is at an all time high. So answer me bait-kun, who really has no life?</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br> There are at least fifteen of you in these threads <br>Theres a lot more than that.</br></br>  <br> its a matter of time you end trying heroine or crack <br><br>damn I wonder how long I have then, it's been over a decade now.</br></br></br>  <br>Lolicon here.<br><br>I have no job,no life and no friends.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358898 <br>What if he's a hebe?</br>  <br>Real children are fucking ugly and I would never touch them, I even hate them enough that I would kill them if there was no consequence.<br><br>Loli is harmless because it is fiction.</br></br></br>  <br>One Naruto thread is too many.<br><br>Modcat knew this and protected us from them, current mods need to get their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>Well fatty get ready to get one. <br>Sys admin job here and I am doing just fine as a lolicon.</br></br>  <br>bottomless is hotter.</br>  <br>I agree, but seeing the mods act is atleast something. Fuck the times when we've had multiple Naruto threads going with their shitty post quality. The mods are going to the right direction with this move.</br>   delete the recs threads <br> doesn't delete the normalfags shitposting here <br><br>thank based mods.</br></br></br>  <br>Really? I have no idea how you can do that anon. Are you at least looking for a job?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>Yet it looks like it's the first time you saw a loli thread.<br><br>I hate summer. It's always the same every year : some normalfags hear about 4chan, start their personal rant about whatever they don't like about otaku culture, then leave. /a/ should seriously find a way to ban newfags from this board.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358108 <br> paedophiles <br> on /a/ <br>Some people just don't understand ironic loliposting.<br><br>The top. Be gentlemen</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ should seriously find a way to ban newfags from this board. <br>We can't do more than the usual hostility and reporting, honestly.</br></br>  <br>it looks like it's the first time you saw a bait too, and this one is old.<br><br>I hate summer too, It's always the same every year</br></br></br>  <br>Nope im your typical basement dweller still living with his parent.</br>   calling someone a newfag after responding to pasta   <br>The top of course, who could resist licking that delicious flat chest?</br>  <br>Wow, I have no idea how you can live like that.</br>  <br> no friends <br>You have us</br></br>  <br> /a/ should seriously find a way to ban newfags from this board. <br>I think, as a test, the OP of each thread should be given the ability to delete posts from it. That way, threads started by faggots will be full of faggotry, and easily distinguishable, and threads started by legit posters won't have to wait for mods/janitors (who, most of the time, don't even do anything).</br></br>  Let's settle this once and for all.<br>http://strawpoll.me/4780073</br>  <br>Not anymore for sure.<br><br>This board is just full of cancerous normalfags now.</br></br></br>  <br>Lolicon=/=pedophile</br>  <br>OP can have threads show post-ids when making a thread,</br>  <br> who really has no life? <br><br>Lets see; <br> He actively searches for lolicon threads <br> Instead of just hitting "hide thread" he literally spends hours of his day complaining about how people are liking a thing he doesnt like. <br> seriously thinks he has control over a board or the people who post in it. <br> thinks the moderation staff will listen to his autistic reddit tier pig-squealing over people enjoying drawings. <br><br>normstain has no life lmao</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're drawn children; what don't you understand? There's nothing wrong with being a pedophile anyway. If you want to make the loli vs pedo distinction then I'd like to see 2dsexual vs heterosexual take root first</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares? Holy shit I swear /a/ should be the board that welcome loli with open arm but instead its just full of shitposting trash.<br><br> Even fucking /v/ have better loli thread. </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br> That way, threads started by faggots will be full of faggotry, and easily distinguishable <br>While this interesting, it would still decrease the complete quality of the board. Also, it sounds like reddit.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Seriously anons?  Did I need to go all the way to "and you're not so big" to make this more obvious for you? </br></br></br>  <br>Shit poll.<br><br>Better question, how great is a puffy vulva?</br></br></br>  Threads will get deleted if you guys don't start talking about loli.<br><br>Oh wait thats exactly what you false-flagging normalfags want.</br></br>  <br>Very great.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127359062 <br><br>It doesn't even try to be correct.<br><br>Criminal law in Canada is governed by federal legislation; what is a crime anywhere in Canada is a crime everywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Oh wait thats exactly what you false-flagging normalfags want. <br>Hopefully janitor can see the obvious.</br></br>  <br>The puffier the better.</br>  <br> Even fucking /v/ have better loli thread. <br>You can fuck right off, faggot. /a/ has decent loli threads, but I'm sure even a faggot like you can see the issue.</br></br>  <br>I am not attracted to real children at all</br>  <br>Does louise count as a loli?</br>  <br>It's summer. Gaman shite kudasai.<br><br>Summer is great, the air is in heat.<br>Little girls are on the beach and their cunny itch<br>in their cute school swimsuit i see them swimming<br>in their tight swimsuit i am coming</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why I said it should start out as a test. <br>The alternative would be mods doing their job (instead of just deleting random posts they personally don't like and neglecting spam and trolling), but that's not very likely.</br></br>  <br>They're idealized depictions of children that lolicons don't recognize as children much in the same way idealized depictions women aren't recognized as women. They are fantasy creatures that can't possibly exist in the real world.</br>  <br>It looks like it tastes like honey.</br>  <br>Can you post the rest?</br>  <br>I'm not disputing that.</br>  <br><br>This guy is kind of right, of course you guys might not be like that but theres probably some person who wants to try and then he/someone has to blame it on something</br></br>  <br><br>I would just press my face into her panties and inhale, then pull them off and stick my tongue in.</br></br>  <br>It was not even the same shitposter. They attack in grous now?</br>  <br>Nope. She's a grown up and it's purrfectly normal to want to ravage her. No pedo.</br>  <br>They are children within their realm.</br>  <br> creatures <br><br>Is it time?</br></br></br>    <br>Go back to /b/ fbi</br>    <br>That's really shitty logic, it can apply to every single fictional concept anybody ever reads.</br>   replies to every shitpost <br> blames the shitposters for the threads being bad </br>  <br><br/></br>      <br> replying to normstain shitposters </br>  POST LOLI FOR FUCK SAKE.<br><br>YOU ARE REPLYING TO FALSE-FLAGGING NORMALFAGS WHO WANT TO DERAIL THE THREAD IGNORE AND ABOUT FUCKING LOLI.<br><br>YOU FUCKING NEWFAGS ARE SO DUMB STOP REPLYING TO THE SHITPOSTERS.</br></br></br></br>    <br>GTA promote murderer, car stealing, proxénétisme, gun shooting, slut raping/killing, drug dealing, being a nigger, being american, bad mexican music listening, non-respect of car law, non-respect of most laws and gang fighting. I can't believe it's still legal.<br><br>Well, fuck children.</br></br></br>  <br>/pol/ approves loli.</br>  Would you let a loli drive a car on your face?<br><br><br> Normalfags bait <br> normalfags respond to themselves to bait even more </br></br></br></br>    <br>Micro bikinis are so tryhard. The whole point of loli is corrupting innocence. When they already look slutty, it defeats the purpose. You're ill.</br>    <br>This guy draws dem midrifs.</br>    <br>WHOA<br>DUDE<br><br>NICE CREATURE</br></br></br></br>  <br> Would you let a loli drive a car on your face <br>Only fair after I finished running a train on her ass.</br></br>  <br>Anzu is 17. It's totally non-pedo to like her</br>  <br>I want her to pee in my mouth.</br>  <br>That's not a loli.</br>  <br> You're ill. <br><br><br>WHATS THE TIME?<br><br>ITS TIME TO GET ILL<br><br>WHATS THE TIME?<br><br>ITS TIME TO GET ILL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I hate you almost as much as the normalfags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pee is best when filtered through a swimsuit.</br>  <br>The point of loli is that which you give it. I like lolis, and I like slutty and experienced women. If it combines both, it's okay with me.</br>  <br>I like both.<br><br>Femdom loli is just the best.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a big planet.</br>    <br><br>Actually the point of loli is a slutty ~10year old.

I 'aint no pedo.

All these fucking edgelords       Has everyone forgotten the single most determined PA in the history of anime? She's a real life hero and people like her are the only reason any of these other MCs ever see the light of day.  <br>This</br>  <br>Best example of a Gary Stu in any anime ever<br><br> Being able to bend a beam of dark energy with his heel and still retain that glorious blonde hair-do </br></br></br>  I'm still hoping for S2.  Any jojo except Giorno    <br>Never</br>  <br>Is there any show that wouldn't be made better by replacing the MC with Starwind?</br>  <br>This<br>Best shounen MC by far</br></br>  <br>Good taste. He's just like me. Sacrificing his own happiness to save other people and wanting to become a hero.</br>  <br>no, no. shinji is 8/8 at best</br>    <br> Sacrificing his own happiness <br><br>But saving people gives him happiness.</br></br></br>    Is there a single anime that wouldn't be improved significantly with rance in it? I cant think of any.    <br> generic SoL girl #100002 <br> best anything <br><br>Kyoanifags delusional as ever</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am still waiting for my trap doujinshi where he has a girlish lower half.</br>      <br>Cowboy Bebop</br>    <br>this is correct</br>     Six months after the fierce battle with Majin Buu. While the days pass peacefully, Goku works tilling the soil like Chi-Chi had ordered him, while still finding time to train. Meanwhile, newly-weds Gohan and Videl are living happily, but…?! <br><br> SIX MONTHS AFTER BUU WAS DEFEATED </br></br>  <br>Is that a bad thing? Namek was a month after the saiyans.</br>  <br>Gohan and Videl should still be in highschool.</br>  <br>Why wait?<br><br>I mean nothing makes you value a girl like seeing her get wrecked by a bald Russian man. <br><br>Except Gohan then stops fucking training so another bald Russian man can just wreck her shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So this takes place before BoG which was supposed to be years after Buu?</br>  <br><br>Judging from what we see in the trailers. BoG will probably be retconned despite the fact that Toriyama said that it's canon. Either that or this takes place in an alternate reality.</br></br>  <br><br>More like parts in Super will be an "extended" version of BoG. Meaning certain elements and characters of the movie will be put in Super while BoG would be left as an abridged version or something.</br></br>  <br>Weren't they Highschool seniors at the beggining of the Buu saga, anyway?</br>  <br>they were</br>  <br>Videl wanted to fuck. <br>Gohan didn't want to defile her honor.</br></br>  <br> BoG will probably be retconned despite the fact that Toriyama said that it's canon. <br><br>Worst writer ever. It's so obvious that he's just trying to milk it for as long as possible now.</br></br></br>  <br>BoG isn't being retconned, just heavily expanded into a series</br>  <br><br>Well, they both died during the Buu arc. It probably influenced their decision or something.</br></br>   no Pan <br><br>dropped</br></br>  <br> and dragon ball z already has a ten years later canon fast forward <br>What the hell is the point?</br></br>  <br>Chichi still has the super traditional values and it's not like Videl would actually say no so there's no real reason they wouldn't get married at 17</br>  <br> No Pan <br> No Uub <br> No Bra <br> No adult Toramai shenanigans <br><br>I admit that doesn't make me happy, but at least there will be more Whis and Beers</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> more Whis <br>picked up<br> more Beers <br>dropped again</br></br></br></br>  <br>Battle of Gods was 5 years after Buu. It seems very likely that Super takes place in a different continuity from Battle of Gods. <br><br>If Battle of Gods was ever canon in the first place you could say it's being retconned.</br></br></br>  <br>How?</br>  <br> No pan <br> No bra <br><br>Dragon Ball Super is sounding sexier by the minute</br></br></br></br>  inb4 half of it is just reused animation from the movies  <br>I wouldn't be surprised</br>  <br>They have so much potential though.

Uub is still an infant.</br>  <br>What wrong with their GT versions? At least they were more interesting than Goten and Trunks.</br>  <br>Why?

I want to kill this fucken cunt  <br>Enough to win my heart.</br>  Too poor to afford new bread  <br>Poor enough to have to resort to pleasing old men for money so she can buy perfume and lipgloss, to seduce even more men for money.</br>  Why is Yui never the one to bring it back up?

I just went for the most straightforward, "easy" answer but its hard to really know what she wants. But Yukino is the type to reach her hand out an ideal <br><br>Yuki is rationalizing the irrational and she never really has been in touch with her emotions until genuine speech I think. Even with Yui there was always a wall between them; I think Vol 12 Yuki is going to fully open up and she will act on her feelings and desires on her own accord which is the start of her necessary growth.<br><br>I think people tend to over exaggerate her problems and think we need volumes of material that her going into therapy and then doing something to redeem Hachiman and Yui for helping her. She just needs to act based on her own heart and desires more than anything. <br><br>As an aside, Yukino has 3 main animal affinities/symbolism in the novels: cats, bears, and believe it or not, fish. Cats eats fish, bears (Hachiman wants to be a bear rmbr) eat fish, and guess which character has fish eyes<br><br>The motto of the club based on ep 1/vol 1 was Teach someone how to Fish. The club was going to aid others with their problems but in a way so that they can do it themselves (be independent). The funny thing that happened is that in the end, its Yukino who needs the service club the most in finding her own path in life. She alludes to this greatly when talking to 8man about that fish during the aquarium date</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br> buy smartphone <br> doesn't work <br> passtime is shopping with random men <br>Rich slut</br></br></br></br>  <br>A shame Feel didn't animate Yukino hugging Yui's cushions and laughing at what Hachiman said about pasta at Yui's place. Feel really did dramatize Yukino's problems too much, though now that I've read up to chapter 8.</br>  <br>Translate for us?</br>  The whole scene with Yui at the end is gut wrenching. The anime magnified with the music and the fireworks.<br><br>  the way her hand trembles when she gives Hachiman his cookies <br>  "Even so, these are just a token of my gratitude" with so much feeling to her voice <br><br>God it really felt like it was her swan-song.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn it feel<br>Can you translate it?</br></br>  <br> letting random men buy things for her after she pleases them <br><br>Why do you think she's so interested in what Hachiman's career ia going to be and how much he's going to earn?</br></br></br>  I hope somebody steals Yui by the end of the series. I want to see how Hachiman reacts to that.  On a scale of Taishi to Komachi, how close is Iroha to Hachiman?  What would 8man have to say to seduce either Yukino or Yui?  <br> Wakes up at 4am, puts on her tracksuit and delivers newspapers on her old rusty bike, while thinking about the date <br> With the money she earned she buys Anna Sui and pink yarn ball, wondering if senpai would like her scent and the color <br> Spends the days prior to the date knitting a sweater while smiling with the date in mind <br> Wakes up at 4 to prepare herself for the date <br> She stands in front of the partially broken mirror <br> Clears her throat with cute sounds and decides to do her usual rejection rehearsal <br> "Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a b-boyfriend..." <br> Blushes and bits her tongue <br> She is late to the date because she didn't get the train and preferred to save the money for the stylish cafe </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He can literally do anything to them and they would let him</br>  Actually establishing that Iroha is poor would make her more interesting to me. Probably not enough to move her past Yukino and Yui, but it give her more depth than "girl who constantly lies in order to get closer to Hachiman".<br><br>Doesn't the school have a tuition? It's supposed to be a pretty prestigious school isn't it?</br></br>  <br><br>Yukino:<br>  I know what you need. <br><br>Yui:<br>No words are necessary. Just make a physical move on her and she'd break down sobbing uncontrollable tears of joy then she'd put out all you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Poorfag <br> Anna Sui <br><br>It's just a meme. <br>Don't take it seriously.</br></br></br></br></br>  IIRC Watari always describes her cardigan as "worn" so maybe she is poor?  <br>Komachi, since she already knows 8man enough to pull a spot-on imitation of him</br>  <br><br>I know. I'm saying if there was something to it, she'd be a lot more interesting than she is now.</br></br>  <br> Yui <br>Anything in private that could be considered affection<br> Yukino <br>Just using the word genuine makes her panties melt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Spyro plz hurry</br>  <br>Yui is already seduced. She needs to seduce the 8.</br>  <br>I really hope that Yui will win at the end.<br>Underdog's victory is always the best kind of ending.</br></br>  <br>Why does Watari always look like he's perpetually stoned?</br>  Can Haruno pay 8man to have sex with her? What's his price if he does agree to it?  <br>Man, I thought her ship was dead. 8man stop her from killing it. It is going to hurt a lot if he rejects her in the future now that she is sailing again.<br><br><br>Then what does he need to do to Yukino?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think Haruno could seduce him without paying a dime. He gets all flustered every time she closes the gap and starts rubbing all over him.</br></br>  <br>How do you just namedrop designers like that?</br>  <br>There are far more indicators that she comes from a poor family. Which doesn't mean she can't save 4000 yen to afford a bottle of Anna Sui, all the more for a date</br>  <br><br>I hope his next novel series exclusively features a sly, foxy girl.<br><br>No more multiple love interests, I'm a Yui-fag and I feel like Iroha is a stellar character that needs to star a series on her own, from the very beginning.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The flashback to the fireworks combined with the music is what got me. I have nothing at all against Yukino or Iroha but I really hope Yui can pull out the win.</br></br>    <br>He simply needs to give her the genuine.</br>  <br> Man, I thought her ship was dead. 8man stop her from killing it. <br><br>Not only her ship but Yukino ship too.</br></br></br>  <br>Watari self-inserted too hard about her kouhai perfume</br>  <br> what does he need to do to Yukino? <br>Yukino do you want my genuine article?</br></br>  <br>I want to fuck her right in the cunt.</br>  <br><br>I get bi-vibes from Yui, or is just girls being girls with their skinship?</br></br>  <br>I dunno man, everytime Hello Alone plays I keep thinking, it wont end up boding well for Yui in the end</br>  <br>I'm also a Yuifag, but Iroha's only character development thus far has been that she somwhat liked one guy and now likes another guy. Besides being sly, there really isn't that much to her character.</br>  <br>Their seiyuus (Sakura Ayane and Touyama Nao) are a bit too close to each other<br>http://ambiseiy.com/2012/10/30/saku<wbr>ra-ayane-and-touyama-nao/</wbr></br></br>  <br>So you want to fuck Hayama?</br>  <br>Poor enough to please old men for money</br>  <br> Iroha's only character development thus far has been that she somwhat liked one guy and now likes another guy <br>Whoa, then you need to watch the anime again, or  read the LN  </br></br>  <br><br>I want to worship this fucking goddess.</br></br>  What is you favourite chinese cartoon.

Haruna became daijobu because she said it once in one of her lines.<br>Or the whole Akagi gluttony crap that the fanbase came up.</br></br>  <br>Because Haruna has multiple lines saying she's fine or alright. Even before the anime, Ashigara was typified as a desperate Christmas Cake and Akagi as a glutton. Anime just canonized it.</br>  <br> canonized </br>  <br>Its an official adaption, what other terminology am I supposed to use to describe with adjectives the official adaption using fanon and integrating it into the canon?</br>  <br>She became daijoubu because her entire being is daijoubu.</br>  <br>Just because it's official doesn't mean it's canon, anthologies are a perfect example of that.</br>  <br> this is canon </br>  <br>Everything is like that, some people just deny it because it goes agaisnt their fictional persona in their head like certain -fags. I like Akagi and I like fatties too, so I dont mind that; I love Ashigara, and even if its silly how it was born, I dont mind the christmas cake thing too.</br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br> anthologies are canon </br>  <br> official doesn't mean it's canon <br>Are you stupid?</br></br>  <br> Only the lines and material I like are canon </br>  <br>Are you?</br>  <br><br><br>Fubuki on Crack and the game should be the only canon that matters.</br></br></br>  <br>So you are. Otherwise post evidence of the anime being non-canon.</br>  <br> talking nonsense </br>  <br>They went out of their way to say that our Kisaragi was safe.</br>  <br>フタフタマルマル。司令！？　メガネを取ったら私、戦えませんっ！</br>  <br>There's so much shit but I'll go with the obvious one: Henders-chan digivolving into Midway. But seriously, just because something is official has never meant it's canon. As I said the anthologies are perfect examples, not just for kancolle but for any series that has them. The only times such things can be canon is in a franchise where the author comes out and says that all versions are canon due to multiverse shit, which has never been stated for kancolle.</br>  <br> Game Kirishima: I can't fight without my glasses! <br> Anime Kirishima: The fight's getting serious, better take off my glasses! <br>Great adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br> It's 1000! Akagi-san... always looks so wonderful! Someday, I'll be sortieing with her as an escort ship... Ahh..! It's a dream! A dream!  <br>The anime was a dream.</br></br>  <br>One day that line will be replaced or removed, just like how they inserted Fubuki's lust for Akagi into her hourlies to fit with the anime.<br>You just wait.</br></br>  <br>Kancolle doesn't have an author.<br><br><br>That doesn't say the anime is non-canon at all. If its official, then by DMM and Kadokawa's logic, its "canon". Canon material with LNs, 4koma, official manga, etc...don't have to overlap in their continuities.<br><br>Glad that's settled.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Fubuki and Mutsuki only got their kai nis and hourlies because of the anime.<br><br><br>But it has a head developer, Tanaka.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The game changed one of Bucky's lines to fit for her not-gay lust for Akagi, just to further support the anime.<br><br>Funny huh?<br><br><br>Tanaka doesn't own Kancolle. Kadokawa and DMM do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fubuki and Mutsuki <br>You forgot someone else there.</br></br>  <br>Have they ever changed hourlies?</br>  <br>Not yet but hopefully they do for the cranes because god are their lines boring.</br>  <br> head developer <br> Tanaka <br>So what? He doesn't own Kancolle, he's not its creator, and he bows to whatever he's told to do from the company execs.<br><br>He's in no more position of exercising creative decisions or independence over Kancolle then Tomino is with Gundam.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The game changed one of Bucky's lines to fit for her not-gay lust for Akagi, just to further support the anime. <br>Which makes that canon, not the anime. Funny how they didn't retcon Kirishima's glasses line.</br></br>  <br>So far, not yet. But they changed Hamakaze's lines to remove Shinano name from being mentioned.</br>  <br> Which makes that canon, not the anime. <br>Prove it. You are cherrypicking whatever suits your argument without actually offering a proper rebuttal.</br></br>  <br>The only canon is the game. The anime is not canon, get over it.<br><br><br> he's not its creator <br>That's what he's credited as every time his name comes up in published materia.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why most people here live in such denial to the point to deny some facts because it doesnt met their criteria? Is this common in other multimedia franchises too?  <br> The only canon is the game. <br>The only canon is whatever Kadokawa and DMM say is canon. And that's represented by official manga, LNs, 4koma, and the anime with the game.</br></br>  <br>And so what? So is Tomino, guess how much oversight or influence he has on the Gundam franchise at large?<br><br>Its the same with Tanaka.</br></br></br>    <br>I like how Zuikaku asks what is for breakfast/lunch/dinner. I do agree that Shoukaku's lines are boring.</br>  <br>The official manga (the 4koma is a manga too you fuckwit), LNs, and anime constantly contradict each other and the game. The only one you can take up as canon is the game since it's the fucking source of the franchise, just like in any other franchise. I don't understand why you want to treat kancolle differently to any other franchise.</br>  <br> Canon material with LNs, 4koma, official manga, etc...don't have to overlap in their continuities. <br>Then what the fuck does canon mean? If there's zero continuity, it's not exactly canon is it? If there are derivative works, there must be an original. The original is the game. The canon. You can spend all day arguing that the anime deserves to be taken seriously, but in the end you're as rational as Yurispammer.</br></br>  <br> constantly contradict each other and the game <br>Kadokawa doesn't care.<br> I don't understand why you want to treat kancolle differently to any other franchise. <br>I'm treating it like the multimedia franchise it is, you stupid fuck. All official published material from Kadokawa and DMM is canon by default.<br><br>Turkey LN takes about multiverses and different realities and how those things work. Kadokawa doesn't give 2 shits if things contradict each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> changed <br>They didn't change any.</br></br>  <br>Dumb vatnik.</br>  <br> All official published material from Kadokawa and DMM is canon by default. <br>That's not how it works you little shit.</br></br>  <br> no rebuttal <br> strawman argument <br> false equivalence  <br>Is this how you try to argue a point when you are losing?</br></br></br></br>  <br> All official published material from Kadokawa and DMM is canon by default <br>That's wrong.</br></br>  <br>What's right then?</br>  <br>Then post an explicit statement regarding canon in Kancolle by Kadokawa, you stupid fuck. Oh wait you can't, because they have none other then "official material" takes place over fanon.<br><br>That's it.</br></br></br>  When even one of the official artists comes out and says not to take the anime seriously it says a lot about how shit it is.  I wish we'd get an official work in which Shigure is recognized as a boy.  <br>Then post proof.<br><br><br> artists <br> having say on anything </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did she say this before or after the kai nis?</br>  <br>By your argument that means nothing is canon because no set canon has been established, which is retarded because the game exists.</br>  ITT: players vs. anime apologist  <br>That's not my argument. <br><br>My argument is Kadokawa doesn't give a shit, if its official, its about as "canon" comes. Official material &gt; fanon material. And I have yet to hear a counter to the example with the Turkey LNs talking about multiverses and alternate worlds and realities so all of the different official material can overlap without contradicting each other.</br></br></br>  <br>Whatever is explicitly stated by Kadokawa to be canon. And if they don't you use the original source as default.<br><br>The proof is that those official works contradict themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up fatass, get sunk in Midway again.</br>  <br>The Turkey LN talking about multiverse and alternate worlds refers to how shit happened differently in the world the shipgirls manifest than in the world they remember being ships in.</br>  <br>At least it has some relevant discussion to the board instead of x girl ciclejerking threads.</br>  <br>Secondaries are cancer</br>  <br> The proof is <br>No proof then<br> those official works contradict themselves <br>See <br><br><br>The Turkey LN talks about how the concept of kanmusu and Abyssals with the game setting exists as well. Its the entire package mate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone defending the anime isn't that different from a shitposter.</br>  In most multimedia franchises, the only thing most people consider canon is usually the original source. If something contradicts the original, it's usually discarded.<br>I don't know why this one is a special case. Is it because there's a ton of yuribait in the anime?</br>  <br>So you should probably get a terminal disease and die then.<br><br><br> get called out on your retarded argument about how canon and continuity works in Kancolle <br> equate it falsely with "defending" the anime <br>Typical shitposter logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want the Myoukou to form a circle around me and jerk me off.</br>  <br>No, this discussion is retarded.</br>  <br> /a/ </br>  <br>I knew the mauposters were behind it.</br>  <br>Dumb mauposter.</br>  <br>Was this all part of your plan?</br>  <br><br> get wrecked repeatedly in the thread <br> one-liner response </br></br></br>  <br><br>You've essentially killed any credibility you had by resorting to mauposting. This argument ends here, the anime isn't canon, deal with it.</br></br>  <br>You should have used a kagapic intstead, everyone would listen to you and never ever doubt you.<br>Also, you are not wrong, but not exactly right either.</br></br>  <br>Dumb mauposter.</br>  <br>What are you even babbling about? So far if you are the same retard I've been arguing with you've been unable to refute anything I've said, present evidence of your claims, made false claims, and can't even formulate a proper argument without making shit up.<br><br>Who are you talking about credibility when you have none to begin with?</br></br></br>  <br>Where did she say that in the game?</br>  <br>You've been arguing with more than one person, shitface.</br>  <br> my statement is the most important <br> I can't prove my point but the anime isn't official or canon because I say so <br>Thanks for the concession, chuckles.</br></br></br>  <br>Hourlies.</br>  <br>10pm.</br>  <br>Probably. I can't see why else someone would defend the anime.<br><br>Her hourlies.</br></br></br>  <br>So have you, autism chan.</br>    <br>Because the anime had staff from the Kadokawa overseeing it, with the added bonus of game lines being added or changed to reflect the anime's personalities. Hell, we have Tanaka talk about how the admiral in the anime was supposed to reflect the viewer.</br>  <br>Good thing I'm not kuso enough to to sink my Kisaragi.</br>  <br> Hell, we have Tanaka talk about how the admiral in the anime was supposed to reflect the viewer. <br>Pretty sure that just pissed off everyone and made people want to disregard the anime more. Also, it wasn't Tanaka, it was a staff from the anime.</br></br>  Shikinami is cute.  <br>He also said to leave things to our own interpretations.</br>  <br>Tanaka was working with the production staff from Diomedea. He even made multiple tweets talking about his experiences over there months before the anime aired.</br>  <br>Despite being plain all of Shibafu's DD are kinda cute.</br>  Hey, remember how the ship girls and Abyss had magic shields in the first couple episodes? Neither did the anime's staff.  <br>I'm not a kuso who makes awful decisions because of a desire to fuck Fubuki, so the anime admiral didn't reflect anything.</br>    <br><br>Tanaka doesn't own KanColle.</br></br>  <br>Which was a nice excuse for the production staff to fling all the blame into his face when the anime was over.</br>  <br> plain </br>  <br>All DDs are cute.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> potato <br> not plain <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>    <br>Tanaka is the kancolle.</br>  <br>How many girls died for her returning?</br>  <br>Hell no. And some are way too sexy to be called cute.</br>  <br>It's uncommon for people to consider contradictory works canon, not the other way around.</br>  <br>All of her divisions, squadrons, and fleets.</br>  <br>This is not canon.<br><br>This is canon.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a reason why エロ可愛い is a word.</br>  <br/>  <br>But Kisaragi and Arashio are cute, anon.</br>  <br>Raian please no one said they weren't.</br>  <br> Only one anon can like Mutsukis </br>  <br> Arashio <br> Mutsuki </br></br>  <br>Inb4 <br> Arashio <br> Mutsuki </br></br></br>  <br>Too late.</br>  <br>Osoi.</br>  <br>おそーい！！</br>  <br>Im sure everyone half sane knew what I mean, but this is shitpostcolle at this point.</br>   Secondaries that actually liked the anime and are defending it <br><br>I miss when things were all fun and nice before the anime ruined everything</br></br>  <br>The arguments before the anime were worse.</br>  <br>Yeah<br> -m-maybe Fubuki won't be a bad MC <br> she's only there to make other girls shine </br></br></br>  <br> muh ciclejerking threads </br>  <br>I forgot what we were even arguing about during Fall event already.</br>  <br>I just remember the Harunafish arguments from right before the anime aired.  Fucking chinkfag. </br>  <br>Maushitposting</br>  <br>Maushitposting wasn't a thing back then.</br>  <br>Yes it was. Mauposting in its earliest forms started to pop up back in late august 2014.</br>  <br>You can't just disregard it because you hate it.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/117331<wbr>867/#117338211</wbr></br>  <br>You can't just not disregard it because you love it.</br>  <br> Fuck you too and fuck memes </br>  <br>Yes, he can. Especially when people who actually contributed to the game are telling you to do just that.</br>  Some light cruisers need a kai ni.  <br>What arguments?<br><br>Outside of the incredibly autistic spammers that dedicated themselves to shit the threads, there were no real arguments.<br><br>Now these threads are filled with shitty secondaries (Tertiaries?) that watched the anime and thought it was the best thing ever.<br><br>Manga/4koma secondaries were mostly nice and never had this much shit taste and you could still have nice conversations with them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too dank for you?</br>  <br>Maybe Tenryuu would actually be useful outside of expeditions if she got one.</br>  <br>No one will care so long as they'll be weaker than Jintsuu.</br>  <br>I didn't make the bingos because I liked what was on it.</br>  <br> threads are filled with shitty secondaries <br>One or two people don't fill a thread.</br></br>    <br>I spot Yamashirianon.<br><br><br>A CL is getting a kai 2 this summer.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Kuma or Nagara, hopefully, but the rest are okay too.</br></br></br>  <br>It'll be Agano-class to give more 15.2 kai.</br>  <br>Going by the fairy it'll be Noshiro specifically.</br>  <br>I doubt it. She'll be stuck doing expeditions forever.</br>  <br> ZKMS being a loli or not argument <br>Man, it feels like that was last week.</br></br>  <br>And she was drawn by Konishi on a cover with the dork.</br>  <br><br>gay, but I can deal with it.</br></br>  <br><br>I want a Kai 2 for the Burger eater.</br></br>  <br>Zuihou getting Kai II would be cool too</br>  <br>She already has the sakura holo background, she doesn't deserve more.</br>  So, tell me. For someone who dosn't know shit about Kancolle.<br><br>Why do people keep comparing it with Touhou? <br>Both franchises having nothing to do with each other, are complete different games with complete different settings.<br><br>I do not understand.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shitposting. That's it.</br>  <br>They're both very popular in Japan, and both boast a huge amount of doujin content. Apart from that they're not similar at all, no.</br>  <br>Large amount of fanmade content and shitposting.</br>  <br>Zuihou actually has a decent size chest in her LN, I was surprised.</br>  <br>Because autism</br>  <br>It's all shitposting, don't take it seriously. A lot of the time it's even done by people who know nothing about either franchise.</br>  <br>That bait.</br>  <br>Kanco killed Touhou.</br>  <br>One side has official voices and good art, the other doesnt, guess which side is the butthurt one?</br>  <br>The side that always starts the Kancolle vs 2hu shitposting?</br>  Which bear is best bear?  <br>That Kaga is too  cute  for me</br>  <br>Kuma rinko </br>  <br>How is this still a question?</br>  <br>Kumashiro</br>    Arguments about what define Kancolle's "canon" are more on topic then 90% of what these threads regularly constitute.  <br>When did anyone say it was off topic?</br>  <br>No it's not. Kancolle discussion are always on topic.</br>  <br> game discussion <br> on topic </br></br>  https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%<wbr>80%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A1%E3%82%8A%E8%82<wbr>%89%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5?src=hash</wbr></wbr>  <br>It's a kancolle thread. Deal with it.</br>  <br>Then go to /jp/.</br>  <br> game discussion <br> not kancolle related </br></br>    <br>Here to stay.</br>  <br><br>Game discussion by itself is not allowed.</br></br>  <br>Game discussion by itself never happens, it's always just in between shit in the thread.</br>  <br>Meh, what a hentai artist<br><br><br>I laughed</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean like a few months ago having a mod post in a thread saying game discussion is not allowed period on /a/ for Kancolle threads? I didn't screencap it then but I'm sure someone else did.<br><br>And it happens quite a bit. If you guys just want to talk about 4koma, manga, LN, or whatever that's fine but game discussion itself is not allowed on /a/.</br></br></br>  Why is Sazanami's voice so bad holy shit  <br><br><br><br>is there a rar file with all of these?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They got someone off the street to voice her.</br>  <br>Yeah like that had any impact, specially when it was posted in a thread that wasn't even a kancolle thread but rather mostly /k/ and /pol/ shitposting on a thread made by a /k/ faggot who thought Musashi's wreck getting found was anime related just because Musashi is in kancolle.<br><br>In conclusion, it didn't change jack shit and I'll keep whining about Re every month.</br></br></br>  <br>Wat. She's literally the only good girl from her division, she's perfect.</br>  <br>What level is your Yamashiri at?</br>  <br>It was posted in a Kancolle thread, directed at Kancollefags.</br>  <br>datfuckingwallscroll.jpg<br>This is pretty much the translation only and shitposting thread, deal with it.</br></br>  <br>Tell that to Refrain. Half the time he makes a translation thread he ends up asking game questions and people help him.</br>  <br>I like how the mod mentioned the TTRPG in that post, something that never gets brought up on /a/. <br><br>I also like how some mod or janitor let that thread stay up and deleted a thread that was /a/ related at the time.</br></br></br>  <br> I also like how some mod or janitor let that thread stay up and deleted a thread that was /a/ related at the time. <br>I was actually pretty mad when that happened.</br></br>    <br>It was hardly a kancolle thread.</br>  <br><br>in your base stealing your girls and impregnating them.</br></br>  <br>I found it funny how he didn't realize that game mechanics are actually relevant since they got brought up so much in the anime. It was just hilarious.</br>  <br>But I tought anime wasnt canon? Make up your mind.</br>  <br>What can you expect from people who don't get paid?</br>  <br>You're still a retard.</br>  <br>How did what he say contradict the anime not being canon in any way? What?</br>  <br>I'm saying that it's related because it was in the anime, whether the anime was canon or not is irrelevant to that. And since most of the personalities that we know come from the game, and some pretty important shit about the maps being based on history of the ships which shapes the personalities of the girls, it's pretty a pretty silly argument.</br>  Ikazuchi is a good girl!  <br>I miss Refrain</br>  <br>His ban should be over by now shouldn't it?</br>  <br>Ikazushit.</br>  Remember the faggot who said you couldn't discuss girls who weren't in the anime and it was game discussion to do so?  <br>All of the 6th destroyer division are good girls, anon.</br>  <br>For you.</br>  <br>The fact that he basically announced he was ban evading may have gotten it extended. <br><br>Yes. He also said Yamato didn't have pads for the same reason I recall.</br></br></br>      <br>Right, I forgot about that. Too bad he doesn't translate everything before posting or he'd be able to just put it on pastebin for someone else to dump.</br>    <br>I find it funny how you think pure game mechanics are somehow intrinsically linked to vanilla anime/manga/LN discussions on /a/.</br>  More German ships when?  <br>That's a tank, isn't it?</br>  <br>That's a girl.</br>  <br>Well, my my point is that why are we here since the only thing related to the board are translations?<br>I came from the other board, but dont really post that much in general, there's way too much drama in both boards, one is muh 2hu killer and the other is muh canon. Why even bother discussing something if we always know how will it end?</br></br>  <br>6thDesDiv is useless</br>  <br>I want to take a bath with Houshou</br>  <br>With that kind of thinking why even have an anime board when it all leads to shipping wars, shitposting, power level discussions, QUALITY, etc.?</br>  <br>You're useless.</br>  Cute  No matter the shitposting, arguments, or bait. I love you all, you kuso faggots.  <br>If the 6th DesDiv is useless then how come they're the DD division with the most kai 2s?</br>  <br>You need one for sure.</br>  <br>They are, since many of them reference or talk about the game mechanics.<br>If you're saying that we should only talk about the ones referenced in those works, that's stupid.</br></br>  <br>You mean the DD division with the worst Kai 2 art?</br>  <br>But we both know its true. Im just here because it gets boring to stare at expedition timers 24/7, and sometimes its funny to see some anons smash their heads against the screen from some low quality baits. Im sure some people are alone and just want some sort of refuge here.</br>  <br>Go learn moon or how to typeset so you won't be so bored.</br>    <br>Im kinda at the start of that process, but every step forward makes me want to c4 my brain, I mean like, why?</br>  <br>Mutsukis aren't DDs, they are paper craft.</br>  <br>You should post and praise your waifu more like me</br>  <br><br>Shyness and breast envy.
