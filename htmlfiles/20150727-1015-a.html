Here's the chapter: Mikan wows everyone in Phy. Ed. The geek boys are smitten and try to get a peek as she goes up the stairs but are deterred because Mikan is super self-reserved. However, when she gets home she lowers her defenses completely, and it almost seems intentional after the bath chapter and subsequent remarks from Mikan.<br><br>I know 0 moonrunes.

The scan isn't that great either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikan's anus is defense</br>  <br>By the way, my Japanese isn't exactly great so some group like CXC could probably translate this far better. Again, just version 0.1 or whatever you want to call it.</br>  <br>Can you translate the title too, please?</br>  <br>Mikan wows everyone in Phy. Ed.<br><br>How? She's short and flat?</br></br></br>  <br>Read the fucking chapter. The other girls are even shorter.</br>  <br>Disclaimer: I don't quite understand the text on the side there.<br>The<br> 花は降りたしパンツは白し... <br><br>The "way out of our league" part is some Japanese saying which is more literally translated as "the flower at the top of the hill", which means an unreachable goal.<br>Out of our league might not be that great of a translation but the message is more or less the same.<br><br>I *think* the text on the left is something like "the flower's panties are white" or something along those lines.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How? <br>Cute butt</br></br>  I am not a lolicon but I think Mikan is sexy as fuck. She is so goddamn hot and her body is amazing.  Why does it seem like Mikan's got more junk in her trunk when Lala's got the bigger ass?  <br>SHE WANTS IT</br>  <br>That seems like a poem<br><br>Flowers are falling, <br>Panties are white</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Thanks, I love you. Have cute Mikan.<br><br><br>Amen to that.<br><br><br>Sister of the harem king.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Anybody else getting her to add to their wedding lingerie collection?<br><br>Hopefully after Nana will be Yami so I can have two pairs of sisters in this set. Either way fuck yes Nana finally got a good figure.</br></br>  <br>Is that Lala?<br><br>I'm not sure, I'd rather have the Haruna one at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>Ahh that explains it. You're probably right.<br>I got really confused because there seemed to be 2 topics in the sentence but it's probably suppose to be 2 sentences.<br><br>Got any better suggestion for how to translate the "flower on the hill" part?<br> マジ高嶺の花だよな <br><br><br>Of course. Got Haruna on preorder as well. I don't even like Haruna that much but it would be weird to miss one from my collection.<br><br><br><br>It's Nana.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just said it was Nana</br>  <br>because shes smaller than lala yet has a pretty round butt despite her smaller body<br>the shape is unreal</br></br>  <br> school swimsuit tan <br>diamonds</br></br>  <br> flower on the hill <br>That reminds me of Saki, her older sister says something like that to her, she's a flower on the mountain top.<br><br>In this case it's figuratively a mountain the boys from her class can't climb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Every day I would   walk her home gently </br>  <br>Takane is not a hill.<br>It's a high peak.

What kind of strange power does she possess.  Bump  <br>Kanji looks like 時間</br>  <br>I don't know if you're still here. That little bit on the side says "The flower has been plucked and the panties are white." 折る can mean to pluck flowers.</br>  Mikan's parents should have done the world a favour and made more babies.  <br>First make out partners are either cousins or schoolmates</br>  Kay, here's 2 months of flash cards and google translate<br><br><br>Oo~/Mikan did it!<br><br><br>Wow, class-A's Yuuki Mikan/ Cute and capable (something)/<br>Oh her panties are going to be seen!/ Eh/<br>Her guard is strong~/Yeah, that Yuuki-san<br><br><br>Dammit, what do I have to beg to see them?/ N-no way, it's impossible isn't it./ Yuuki-san's panties, what kind are they?/<br>Rito~/<br>Get some more ice cream for the refrigerator.<br><br><br>You... are too relaxed/ Not really, I'm at home./<br>Her breast...

I think she's made excuses like two or three times already. The author certainly wouldn't keep it as a persistent plot point just to have it drop like that.</br>  <br>I think that after the whole DARKNESS thing, he realized that without Momo pushing for the harem plan, there wouldn't be any motivation for the plot to continue, so he laid Momo's doubts to rest in order to have a functioning story (read: backdrop for all the shenanigans).<br><br>If it resurfaces, it will only do so because the author is in desperate need of some drama.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But the chance of making more Ritos is too great  Riko however is also acceptable </br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say that. If anything, it increased the doubts in her heart. <br><br>She's now not really sure if she really truly wants this.<br><br> No other option <br>What if there was an option, however? We probably won't find out considering Lala and Haruna won't just go away but she's real close to shaking.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> censored <br>What sort of unlimited faggot are you?</br></br>  <br>R-rule abiding</br>  <br>That little spark right there at the lower right image, it's the spark/sound that comes from Rito slapping himself into his sister's tight butt.</br>  Is Mikan legitimately, canonically sexually interested in her brother?  <br>It's a play on this phrase: https://kotobank.jp/word/%E8%8A%B1%<wbr>E3%81%AF%E6%8A%98%E3%82%8A%E3%81%9F<wbr>%E3%81%97%E6%A2%A2%E3%81%AF%E9%AB%9<wbr>8%E3%81%97-603287</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Superior parent coming through</br>  <br>Manga nipples are allowed.</br>  <br> condom <br><br>No dearest sister. We are making superhuman inbred babies.</br></br></br>  Mikan has alll the hips necessary to birth children already.<br><br>Rito should get on the case already.</br></br>  <br>Yes. <br>Not even making it up, after she first took a bath with rito (secretely peeping and sitting on his dick) she totally took a liking to it and wants to do it again.</br></br>  This world does not have enough mikan doujinishi.  <br>I wanna see her nekkid so bad. Please Yabuki...</br>  MIKAN IS THE SOFTEST  <br>Nah, that would be sensei</br>  <br>I'd</br>  <br>Dear Lord</br>  <br>Why is this allowed?</br>  <br>Because you want to commit the crime...</br>  <br> That is 11 years old guise </br>  <br>Assuming you're still here or were still wondering. 花は折りたしパンツは白し is as  says.<br><br>The original expression 花は折りたし梢は高し is literally something like "wanting to pluck a flower but the branch being too high". The metaphorical meaning is 欲しくても手に入れる方法がない which is like you said, "wanting something but not being able to get it".<br><br>As for the meaning of 花は折りたしパンツは白し my best guess is 花 is being used to refer to her body/lewd bits and with her white panties being the obstacle that can't be overcome. It's very simple what's trying to be said which is that the kids want to see her lewd bits but she's on high guard against them. It's ironic since she's completely relaxed around Rito.<br><br>Maybe something like "behind white panties, an unreachable flower" or something along those lines would work as a translation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>12, actually</br>  <br>Could this be a good reason?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I don't see Mea in this thread, and not just regular Mea. Mea (Nemesis Fused), you motherfuckers have shit taste, your fantasy of fucking a sibling is good, but it's still not best-tier.<br><br>Nemesis's femdom and sexually charged body transformations and playful sex teasing.<br><br>Mea's sexually charged lickity lick fetish and psycho-dive that connects body to body on a deeper level, making you feel her pussy as you thrust into it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too old. Do I look like I'm into grannies?</br>    <br>Yeah I know the meaning of the phrase, which is why I translated it as being out of their league (unobtainable).<br>It's the text on the side I don't get. Maybe it is like you said, or maybe it's like  said. <br><br>I don't know how to translate it into English in a good sounding way either, but I think the "out of our league" kind of gets the message across decently but I am sure there is a better way to formulate it.<br><br><br><br>Mea is great. One of my favorites. I prefer regular Mea though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pedophilia is a core /a/ value, newfag.</br>  <br>Lolicon is, not pedophilia.</br>  <br>Semantics.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Some translator did it a few days ago m8, look in the archive</br></br></br></br>  <br>What, are you too much of a chicken to admit that you are a pedo, friend?</br>  <br> braided girls slowly unraveling into ong loose hair flowing down your back <br><br>you have no idea how bad this fetish is for me</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but not all people who like loli are attracted to 3d brats.</br>  <br>"Out of your league" doesn't' convey the whole "unreachable flower under the white panties" naughty joke though.</br>  I want to reach for Mikan's flower.... if you know what I mean.  <br>Pedophilia implies an interest in 3DPD</br>  <br>Those things are related.</br>  <br>Lolicon is. Mikan IS a loli. Saying Mikan is too old means toddlercon, which is a) FUBAR or b) edgelord shit, depending on whether you mean it.</br>  <br>Personally I'm more into babyfur.</br>  <br>It's still a chronophilia, just because you wouldn't touch a 3D kid doesn't mean you aren't attracted to a kid<br><br>The word you're thinking of isn't pedophile (a person attracted to children), it's pederast, which means a child-raper. All pederasts are pedophiles, but not all pedophiles are pederasts. There's nothing morally wrong with being a pedophile, but there is something morally wrong with being a pederast.<br><br>I should also point out that pedophile as a word is abused frequently, pedophile would be for pre-pubescents, for teens it's hebephilia and ephebophilia.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>as much as liking gory movies is related to being a psycho who wants to kill masses of people.</br>  <br>Actually it does not.<br>Interest in children? Yes.<br>But is it necessarily and interest in real children? No, not at all.<br><br>There's lots of pedos who never touches a real kid or looks at CP, and gets by with 2D loli/shota.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>playing violent games makes you a psycho that wants to kill a lot of people, so its true.</br>  <br>That's the weakest bait I've seen in years.</br>  <br>That's not it. Mikan is the flower and she's been plucked as in taken by Rito. Get your mind of the gutter, anon.</br>  <br>Wrong sensei</br>  <br>Hello again.<br>I translated it a few days ago and now I have edited them. You can find the chapter here:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Yeah I know. I don't know how to translate it in a better way though.<br>"She really is a flower at the top of a peak, isn't she".<br>Does that sound better? Not sure if people will get it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is the TLR i fap to the most.</br>  Older caring sister vs younger feisty sister?<br><br>Vs  Tsundere waifu <br><br>Whoever you choose, you'll share the rest of your life with.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Picking only one </br>  <br>Older caring sister.</br>  <br>You know, I'd sleep better at night if it weren't for the things Mikan does to me. Because of her, I can't in good conscience say I have no attraction to lolis.<br>I'd fare a bit better if I didn't know a girl about her age, who looks a lot like her. My stepsister.<br>As a result, the only time I'm truly happy is sleeping with my girlfriend, who knows what I am and couldn't care less.</br></br></br>  <br>But her lewd bits they are trying to see are her panties.</br>  <br>But she's my waifu!</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  TLR would be so much better if it was only about Rito and Mikan<br><br>If only Rito wasn't such a shitty MC</br></br>  <br>No, it wouldn't. The appeal of TLR is the large number of awesome women being attracted to this almost top-tier dude that keeps diving into their crotches.<br>The series would get boring way too quickly with just one heroine to concentrate on.</br></br>  <br> almost top-tier dude <br> Rito <br>You're joking, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you just say Toddlercon is FUBAR or Edgelord? How is it Edgelord? Last I checked Loli was only a few years older than Toddlercon, the two are connected and the distinction is only by a thin line.</br>  <br>You're right. She's 13 now. Thats too old.</br>  <br>Rito is:<br>1. Good-looking, of the same type of playboy looks like Yui's brother.<br>2. Very athletic and at the top of his school as evidenced by their sports intramurals.<br>3. Can do household chores well.<br>4. Can assist professional mangaka in their work.<br>5. Comes from a rich and successful family.<br>6. He isn't a shithead asshole.<br>7. Decisive during trouble.<br><br>And that's aside from the surprise factor that his body is apparently perfect for being a harem king.<br><br>We know Rito is kind of crappy for not just going with Momo's plan, but that indecisiveness is what's helping create the Harem Plan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rito is pretty top-tier when you look at it.<br> He is very athletic (plays football, can carry girls in his arms while running, can run from assassins etc). <br> He is very kind and gentle. Always taking other people into consideration and wants the best for them. <br> Very reliable. Helps everyone when they are in trouble and is basically raising a child (Celine). <br> It's pretty safe to say that he is at least above average looking judging by the amount of girls he gets. <br> Never any problem with his grades in school despite being very busy all the time. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're exaggerating really hard.</br></br>  Rito is a good MC, but compared to the MC of Trinity 7, Rito ain't shit  Why is Nana underrated? She's best girl.  <br>Those aren't exaggerations. You find all 7 things in the manga several times.</br>  Mikan is 2lewd.  <br> 666  <br><br>Satan loves his marshmallows</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because she isn't 100% dere yet and slowly getting there while other like her who are flat mikan etc. have better qualities than her.</br>  <br>Tell me how they're exaggeration.<br>Rito does kinda look like Yui's brother.<br>Rito does participate and even win intramural events and has been able to avoid attacks that humans couldn't because of Yami.<br>He does chores all the time.<br>He helps his dad quite a bit.<br>His dad is a famous mangaka, and his mom is a famous fashion designer from France. They live in a pretty sizable house and that's something in Japan.<br>He isn't a shithead asshole.<br>He is pretty decisive when shit happens, starting from chapter 1 saving Lala.<br><br>So again, what's the exaggeration there?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not even an Athlete. He used to be but that was quite a while ago. Also being an athlete in jr.high really doesn't mean anything.</br>  <br> he isn't even an athlete <br>The fucker ran a race in the intramurals and won first place.<br>In a recent chapter, everyone said humans couldn't dodge the sword alien's attacks, but they later find out that Rito "leveled up" because of Yami attacking him. Even before that, when Lala and him were stuck on the alien planet, the constant trouble trained him to carry Lala around running in a planet out to kill them.<br>He still knows soccer and has one heck of a kick, knocking out someone harassing Mikan.<br><br>You were saying?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks average. He's not Ichika or Kyon. There are many harem MCs more attractive than him. He used to participate in sports but not any more. Mikan does most of the chores.

Animefag here. I heard the MC is a villain, but 3 episodes in and he's just generic hero, just a skeleton instead of flashy angel-like shit.  <br> Papa Bones <br> hero <br><br>I wish<br><br><br>Poor Arche ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does he have a conception spell?</br>  <br>I don't know m8, killing enemies in battlefield is pretty normal, regardless whether the method is edgy or not.</br>   Think the lizard romance last volume was cute as fuck. <br> Sebas completely blows that away this chapter. <br>Damn Sebas, why you gotta be so suave, let the lizards have something.</br></br>  Will we get to see the papa bones vs shalltear fight animated?  Been out of the loop. Anyone mind explaining where this tidal wave of MMORPG-themed anime came from?<br><br>I recall .hack from way back so the concept isn't new, what made it so popular now?</br></br>  <br>Digimon</br>  <br>MMORPG theme is so old and busted.<br>Resurrection theme is the new freshness.</br></br>  <br>Well, he plans the eradication of a sentient species just to make slightly stronger skellies.</br>  <br>This right here. MMO anime has old source material, soon they've gotta animate something new, and it's all about resurrection nowadays.</br>  <br>Monster Farm</br>  <br>I would most likely say, yes.<br>Because from the previews of Episode 4, it will finish with Volume 1 and dragging Volume 2 over 9 Episodes, would be too long.<br>I would say Episode 5 - 8 will be covering Volume two's 4 Chapters, and Episode 9 - 13 will cover Volume three's 5 Chapters.<br>Everything would be fitting perfectly and ending with a Epic Fight and Ending.</br></br></br></br>  post OC  <br>Nice,here's hoping for a second season.</br>  <br>He's a wizard.</br>  <br><br>Yes we do. Anyone who says otherwise is obvious lower lifeforms (slugs) and should be killed.</br></br>  <br>Because MMOs are dead and we watch the series that use them as a theme trying to relive our best times in games like EQ and WoW</br>  <br>Read the stats.<br><br>Alignment: Extreme Evil<br>Sense of Justice: -500<br><br>Ep 2 the only reason he helped was to see how his powers did against the new world and cause he felt he had a debt to repay to Touch Me. And he wanted info. In other words, he didnt help cause he cares about those humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good God, Ainz. That's just overkill.</br>  So I read Book 1 to 4 and the spoiler for the rest to 9, and I am concerned: MC and his army are way overpowered. I have yet to find anyone who managed to be a threat to them.<br><br>Sure, it's fun to follow a badass' journey, especially when he doesn't act exactly like a Gary Stu, but some credible danger would be nice too.<br><br>Hell, form what spoiler I read, book 9 (and probably book 10) will be about raising his reputation to an even higher level.</br></br></br></br>  PVs again in case you missed them.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2kv<wbr>DO3xJFEY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bU5<wbr>xBWmPp34</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Tuesday when? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, I'm guessing the guy's sane and not overly evil but since he actually has become a lich not only has his emotions being suppressed but he's even matching game stats.<br><br>Though personally if I was extremely evil I wouldn't of left the 2 girls with a protective bubble and drag them along the ground kicking and screaming before dissecting them infront of the village, he could of atomized the village in an instant and saved the chief to force info out of him.<br><br>I know he's smart but that level of evil and to actually help out so much over a PERSONAL debt which he could easily ignore...I got a feeling he isn't sticking strictly to those stats, but I haven't read the manga and not sure if he starts matching stat for stat yet</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a  guild  and potential  WC items .</br>  <br>Would be nice to see him unlease the beast   Rubedo [/spoiler[ </br>  <br>Nigga, he's not the type of evil that goes around starting shit (except with the Lizardmen) or flaunting his power unprovoked. I personally believe he's one of the scary type of evil, the smart kind. He's pragmatic as fuck but not above letting any emotion he can feel sway him to the other side. He isn't as evil as he would have been if he'd been, say, born a lich with his stats but he's growing into his alignment pretty nicely.</br>  <br>So without knowing how strong kingdoms are in this world, you would have comitted pointless slaughter with no real benefit. <br>. There's evil, and there's stupidity. Nigga, you dumb</br></br>  <br>After Monday.</br>  <br>I'm playing FFXIV and it's more like the MMO's depicted in these recent anime than anything else.</br>  <br>Is it supposed to be loyal? It looks like it'd bite the hand feeding it.</br>  <br>Indeed, the alignment system in D&amp;D doesn't cover everything for a reason, when Stupid Evil, Stupid Good, Lawful Stupid, Stupid Neutral and Chaotic Stupid most certainly exist.</br>  <br>I thought that's what Int and Wis are for? It's not surprising quite a few people on this board have like -5 on their modifiers.</br>  <br>I suppose stupid being relegated to an INT score makes sense, but even players with proper INT scores still play Stupid all the time. Especially Chaotic Stupid.</br>  <br>I doubt anything in new world could be a threat to Nazarick.<br>Heck an army consist of 1500 demi-god levels 100 and they still coudn't past 8th floor.</br></br>  <br>It was perfectly possible to get through Nazarick with a dedicated team. They just gave up at lvl 8 because of the gotcha and didnt bother to try again.</br>  <br>Weren't most of those NPC mercenaries?<br>Plus all the 41 members were there.</br></br>  <br>Ainz is scared of other players who may or may not show up and we have those Dragon Lords and unknown world items around. Tension is generated because we don't know yet. Overlord has a ways to go and I'm sure there will be dangers that sort of threaten Nazarick...maybe, possibly. But just reading how they crush the lowly humans and enslave the other races is fun in its own way.</br>   Anime too dragged out <br> No spooky orchestra music playing on background when SPOOKY SKELETON on stage <br>Why the fuck is anyone even watching this</br></br>  <br>In the novels, he does experiments on humans. Not sure if they will show that in the anime. But human experimentations are definitely EVIL.</br>  <br>That's just playing out of character, or possibly in line with their background text and such. You can't measure everything with numbers even in DnD after all.</br>  <br>Which NPC ?<br>They can't even touch 1 member since they failed at 8th floors</br></br>  <br>Because It's entertaining and I'm autistic enough to enjoy infodumps?</br>  <br>A lot of those were NPCs and they got trolled by Victim who inflicted all the status effects in the game then Ainz nuked them with a World item.</br>  <br>I remember reading that the 1500 strong army was composed mostly of NPC mercenaries.</br>  <br>From a human perspective. From a Nazarick / Undead Overlord perspective? Not really. He's not even biologically capable of feeling it. <br><br>It'd be like asking a guy who had his nuts and pecker chopped off to stay virile for the rest of his life and he gets to live for the next 300 years after becoming a eunuch.<br><br>It's not like he doesn't realize it's bad by human standards, he just can't afford to care at this point when he's prioritizing safety and his body helps a fuck ton.<br><br>Whereas in a human body he'd be sweating bullets and guilt tripping himself so hard he'd never let it go through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Rubedo ?<br>I thought she's the reason for their failure.</br></br>  Gamma the best.  <br> and the spoiler for the rest to 9, <br>Where?</br></br>  <br> experiments <br> On humans <br><br>I eagerly await this, I know his emotions have been suppressed and this just suits that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just like lizard sex</br>  “Climb. Even if you desire power, don’t give up your humanity.”<br><br>“Give up on my humanity…? Are you speaking of the likes of demons that appear in stories?”<br><br>“That and others like turning into an undead or magic life forms.”<br><br>“A normal human cannot do something like that.”<br><br>“That’s true… but turning into an undead will often twist your heart as well. Desiring perfection, becoming an undead to achieve one’s ideal… the heart will be tempted by the changing flesh and the resulting transformation will be terrifying.”<br>Nooo Ainz stay good!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm also an animefag. <br><br>He monologues pretty heavily about how his current form is desensitizing him to just about anything that would make him flinch as a human being. <br>Pretty hard to miss the potential for his committing atrocities as he becomes increasingly more absorbed into this form/role of his.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Why would you think that? Nothing about her was mentioned during the description of the raid.</br>  <br>The formula is that the MC is overpowered but he plans meticulously and fully expects more resistance but he ends up winning much easier than he expects. It's been repeated since vol 1. Even in vol 7 when Demiurge reveals to Ainz that everyone was planning on world domination he just freaks out for a second then just goes with it. There's a part in vol 4. where he's talking with the Guardians and they are like 'well why don't we just do things more obviously instead of skulking around because then we can reveal the enemies faster' and he shits his robe.<br><br>They can't possibly bring out all the details from the LN or WN. There are far too many one sentence things like Ainz's despair aura or the spooky faces coming from the staff of ainz ool gown that never get mentioned again.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but Rubedo probably had a part in it, though how much is another question altogether.<br><br>Every single guardian even PA was not allowed on the 8th floor. It takes someone of Victim level to stay on that floor, so Rubedo had to be something special like  oh I don't know made from the Caloric Stone making her a world class npc and living up to her name? </br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Rubedo isn't mentioned to have done anything yet. I'm not even sure Ainz visited the 8th floor yet at all, since he told everyone to stay out of there. Apparently the strongest are on that floor, even though they aren't lvl100. This doesn't include Victim who came out during vol 4 to float around for a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere she's guards the 8th floor with Victim and Gargantua. Heck a guy said that she even stronger than Touch Me.</br>  Since Lupusregina is the faith-based caster of the Pleiades, I wonder if her name is a reference to the Bitch Queen, an evil god in the Forgotten Realms D&amp;D setting.  <br>Rubedo being the Miko would mean she is level 100. Unless Miko is another NPC by process of elimination it would make her Rubedo, because Lastborn cannot be the same level as Sebas as written earlier.</br>  <br>I wonder what world class items albedo has. I recently read vol 1 of the LN and apparently she has two but they haven't mentioned them. Isn't she World class npc then?</br>    <br>Gargantua guards the 4th floor.<br> Rubedo is rumored to be the cherry blossoms Guardian in the 8th floor, Victim is the 8th floor Guardian.<br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she's on the 8the floor. And the narration did say something vague like "the raid was halted on the 8th floor" and not "Victim stopped the raid on the 8th floor." So I guess it's possible she did something if anyone made it to her lair after Victim went off.</br>  <br>No, it's fundamentally a bit different. Ainz for example has a WC item. However Touch Me is a world class champion even if he doesn't hold a WC item.<br><br>Get the difference? While a WC item certainly puts you on the same level, if not higher depending on the item, your fundamental base isn't changed.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me. <br>Maybe Ulbert? Possibly.</br></br>    <br>By tidal wave you mean a splash n the kiddie pool? You can't name more than 5 anime franchises in the last 10 years that have MMORPG in any significant value.</br>  <br>Ulbert might have strongest magic caster class.<br>But he's not world class chamion.</br></br>   Pdf/epub link please. On mobile atm, can't do shit. ;_;   <br><br>can anyone add in ni shibullath in onto the background?</br></br>  <br>Lupus just means wolf son, theres a lot of wolf queens in fiction.<br><br>I figured.<br><br>see <br>was what I read in the novels<br>Rubedo has done nothing, we just barely know it exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br>Ulbert was the magic equivalent of the world champion. This is because the world champion is pure physical and it'd be unfair to casters.<br><br>Ulbert however was always depicted as playing 2nd fiddle, and Touch Me being the gary stu with his ballin' wife and children being a level 100 raijuu.</br></br></br>  <br>It might just be a repeat of the ainz vs shalltear fight with Shalltear winning because Touch Me isn't an npc. <br><br>The goblin with the wc stick would kill him though and all of the tomb.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>What's this shit I hear about Touch Me and Ulbert getting into it in real life and why it's most likely the reason they quit the guild?</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Many of the 'transported to another world' and "mmorpg is real" have been around for a long time and many are popular. SAO is the latest biggest one for anime, the LN is high ranked as well. Mushoku Tensei is another resurrection type that is the top LN now. But you can go as far back as Zero no Tsukihime or whatever. Overlord is pretty old as is, it took a long time to come from WN-&gt;LN-&gt;anime.</br>    If our youngest was here… if we moved as Pleiades then we wouldn’t have a problem…  <br>So according to Solution, the youngest sister of Pleiades might be in 8th floor too ?<br>Damn, there are just so many secrets about the it.</br></br>  <br>We don't know what Rubedo does. All we know is that currently in the new world Rubedo is the strongest being in Nazarick, cause ya know the other 40 players aren't here and Ainz has one damn gimp shit build that would be low-mid tier max without his decked out items.<br><br>I mean it's a game where the average player at level 100 had 1 divine item max. Max. Most none at all. <br><br>If put into WoW terms, it'd be like vanilla level 60 in blues with one purple from a dungeon versus full t3 with legendary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Rubedo's the youngest.</br>  <br>Why I can't touch all of those Albedos.</br>  <br>Ainz didn't actually use any of his skills to win that, just spamming items. You could say that its just a matter of whoever abuses more World Class items at this point and which effect wins harder.<br>Don't forget all the Divine/Mythic class items that fuck people over too. Gazef without his stamina gloves is pretty shit.</br></br>  <br>Maruyama does keep a lot of potential asspullery handy. Half-done character sheets, mysterious super NPCs in reserve. No ability descriptions for Nazarick's world class items.</br>  <br>She's taking about Lastborn.</br>  <br>Don't forget about Albedo's younger sister.</br>  <br>maybe the miko<br>or rubedo is the miko<br>or Albedo's sister is the miko<br>or albedo's sister is rubedo and she's just hiding in the frozen prison for shits and giggles.</br></br></br></br>  Since Gate is going to get localized, I can only hope Overlord does too later down the line.  <br>This is the kind of story I like. I like my OP MC story with a little substance but not too much that it would overpower my hankering for a good beatdown.</br>  <br>If they're lovecraftian horrors they should be enemies to good and evil alike. Not that "summon them and bail" isn't a suitable strategy for an evil person.<br><br><br>A space marine chapter would probably be on even footing with everything but floor guardians and Ainz himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, so you'd have to wonder what makes her special enough to reside on the 8th floor when she's not even level 100.</br>  <br><br>Oh right, forgot about her. Damn, the 8th floor's pretty balling.<br>Victim<br>Rubedo<br>Lastborn<br>What else?<br><br>Which floor sucks, geographywise? My vote goes to Chair's graveyard. Compared to the others, it's a bit not impressive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't even list out the classes. Since max level is 15 for any class it would have to take up a huge amount of space but of course that allowed him to give Ainz the Eclipse class. <br>I think its a good choice though, because most of the tension in the story is based around how things are going to play out or what new secret move is going to get shown next and we already get enough infodumps as it is.</br></br>  <br>There no information about her so we can't be sure she's a low level NPC like here sisters.</br>  <br><br>The Tundra must be fucking awful if you don't have frost resistance.</br></br>  <br>We can because in the early volumes like vol 1 or 2 it's said other than Sebas the rest of the maids were below a certain level. The second point is the poster of the level 100 npcs, of which there are 9 including the miko.</br>  <br>Not to mention you have to jump into a lake to get to it</br>  <br>I was bored.</br>  <br>Ok, then she must have some special shit like Victim to stay in the 8th floor.<br>Damn, the more we talk the less chance I see PDL could be a threat to Nazarick.</br></br>  <br>This works quite well</br>  <br> fighting cocytus <br>oh god all of them swords<br>I bet his cleave must have been a bitch<br> fighting demiurge in the molten realm <br>I can only imagine him mind controlling people into lava pits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're forgetting that PDL's main skill is subterfuge and trickery and that Ainz is shit at that. Demiurge will probably have to step up his game in order to prevent PDL empowering Penguin to enslave pandora's actors and stealing all the world items and class changing Ainz to a toad or some shit.</br>  <br> Ourobouros is in the new world and is probably the most game breaking in terms of long term <br> World Savior can one shot all of Nazarick <br> Nameless Spellbook allows PDL to know all of Nazarick's spells <br> Potential players that hate AOG <br><br>PDL himself was never a big deal, it's how he goes Hitogami on Ainz's ass that's the set up. <br><br>Plus, the author stated Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 70% of her faces show nothing but anger. <br><br>Come on Narb, those humans aren't that bad, calm down.</br></br></br>   “And those glasses… didn’t they seem incredibly expensive?” <br><br> “Could it be a magic item?” <br><br> “No, isn’t it just a luxury item? Maybe a dwarf made it.” <br><br>Fucking dwarves, man</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's something briefly touched on in vol 7. It didn't go into specifics though.</br>  <br>CD is a chump though. As cute as she is.</br>  <br>Except for the Nameless Spellbook, does PDL even has the others 2 ?</br>  He looks pretty fucking good.  <br> All these pests around me, I want to squash them all. </br>  <br>Who is Certain Death ?</br>  <br>I still don't know what fucking race he is</br>  <br>Orobourus has already been used, its not coming back.<br><br>World Savior should still be in the hands of the goblins because no one is out powering them.</br></br></br>  <br>Lolielf that we see hanging around with the Black Scripture guy, so she's Sloan Theocracies bitch. Apparently part of the Black Scripture but not the leader.</br>  <br> it turns out that one of the goblins under Erin has it and she decides to not use it against Ainz because he saved the village <br>That would be a nice tweest.<br> she doesn't know that Ainz could have revived her parents </br></br></br>  <br>Garuda maybe?</br>  <br>There's noting stating a WC item that was used up in the new world returns to Yggdrasil instead of coming back to the new world.<br><br>In fact, assuming Martial Arts was introduced through Orobourus then that's twice it's been used since translation konjac is clearly one use.<br><br>World Savior was already used by the goblin king so it shouldn't be with the goblins since it's a twenty, so even if it's in the new world it's somewhere random. It'd be super dumb luck for goblins to find it twice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The winged god of Ra</br>  <br>confirmed high crit rate</br>  <br>She's beautiful.</br>  <br>What is Ouroboros's power ?<br>Is it alter-reality or some shit like that &gt;</br></br>  <br>Yep. It's the broken shit where you call the admin team and ask them to do something. By far the most potential over the long term if we're talking about items we know about.<br><br>And we know from how Wish Upon a Star changed that Ouroboros would be even more godly in the new world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There was a post about who was stronger between rubedo and touch me like 2 threads ago. Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz.</br></br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me <br><br>Missed it, source on the author word of god link.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't ouroboros one use though? I think the LN mentioned it being used in order to help that guild steal Ainz's secret jew gold mine. I remember that Ainz has at least two one-shot World items, but I don't know what you're implying with Wish Upon A Star.</br>  <br>How did Wish Upon a Star get changed in the nw?</br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz. <br>As in, it's a direct comparison? Rubedo is stronger because her skills have good compatibility with Touch Me as an opponent?</br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128551<wbr>803/#q128565734</wbr></br>  <br>There nothing stating that orobouros was used for those two things. Another option is that orobouros isn't even in the new world. <br><br>I'm just believing in the fact that the twenty really are just one use items, that does not respawn. So the guild that used it on the mines was the only time.</br></br></br>  <br>One use means it disappears and comes back in the world of Yggdrasil as far as the game goes.<br><br>However, since the item transferred to the new world, chances are after it's used it comes back to the new world. Not proven fact but the way the novels keep hinting at shit and Ainz's paranoia at WC items it'd be more of a buzz kill if it doesn't work this way.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but author just said she's stronger than Touch Me.<br>There's no comparison mention.</br></br>  <br>nah the twenty and one-use world items aren't the same thing<br><br> Answer: The amount of EXP needed from Wish upon a star is dependent on the type of wish granted. In Yggdrasil a player who cast Wish upon a star would be granted 3 random choices from a pool of choices; However, In the New world the spell is a lot more Omnipotent. But basically the larger and stronger the wish, the more EXP given to complete it <br>https://forums.animesuki.com/showth<wbr>read.php?p=5599818<br><br><br>I don't know where you got that idea about the one use items but I'll assume you're right</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Martial Arts is 50/50 but Translation Konjac is clearly hinted.<br><br>Every fucking species in the world right down to the very last descendent's ancestor somehow managed to eat a konjac? You telling me someone went Santa Claus and spread some language jelly during Christmas for a few years in a row and even went in the sea cause sea races can't be bothered to surface?<br><br>Yeah no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the game it gets one of three random wishes to choose from every use.<br>In the new world if you can think it, it will grant it (unless it's going up against a WC item)</br></br>  <br>so what you're saying is<br> Herohero was summoned to spread jelly to the mouth of every being on the planet. <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>Ok<br>So Ouroboros can works on even a larger scale than that ? That's some OP shit.</br></br>  <br>Possibly, but I'm pretty sure he's still busy trying to free Veldora out from the prison. Maybe it was Simmering Teapot instead. She's an eroge voice actor surely making her the best candidate to go Ho Ho Ho.</br>  <br> twenty and one use items not.the same thing <br> These items called the ‘Twenty’ were so powerful that they could only be used once before disappearing. <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What was Teapot's race?</br>  <br>Slime.</br>  There are our twenties that can change the world. We're both arguing about something that may or may not have happened.  <br><br>No wonder he was away from Yggdrasil for so long then showed up overworked.

He didn't quit the game he just logged onto the PTR fucking around.</br></br>  My lord please tell me all the Climb screentime gets toned down in the next chapter.<br>I can't fucking handle the guy. At least Zaryusu was a god damn reptile.</br>  <br>But won't you enjoy how he and Brain get mind fucked by how strong his dandy gentleman effortlessly makes them shit their pants harder than Gazef ever could?<br><br>Especially Brain, he's gotta be going crazy.<br><br> Get whooped by Gazef <br> Think effort is the big difference <br> Gets whooped by Shalltear <br> Thinks race is the big difference <br> Gets whooped by Sebas <br> Just goes with the flow and thinks it's all about MUH MAMORU </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh of course I will but holy shit these last few chapters.<br><br>Also, I liked Brain far more than Climb.</br></br></br>    He thought it was Ainz Ooal Gown for an instance, but it lacked depth and the presence. <br>“Is that… a hug pillow of him… who made it?”<br>“I made it myself<br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>Climb is basically the kid you are meant to hate or pity or root for, and then a few volumes down the line he  gets Gazef'd, probably by the lizards or Hamsuke. </br>  <br>yes really</br>  <br>Damn, wish I had a waifu like that.</br>  <br>No one can outGazef Gazef.

He's just a loyal warrior who is above average that happens to be messing around with the best humanity has to offer. He's a foil for everyone that Ainz shits upon.</br>   dat lizardsex on vol.4 <br>I kinda want to see Ainz's facepalm got animated.</br>  <br>You forgot shit at following orders.<br> Call me Momon we need to do this ninja shit <br> okay momon-sama <br> Call me momon <br> okay momon-sa- n <br> fine thats good enough </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hamsuke <br><br>Let it happen. I feel like we're not getting enough of him. I know you're embarrassed to have him around Ainz but you already registered him anyway so bring him out for a walk or genocide or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Plenty of people on /a/ hate Climb, it's enough for me to be considerate to them and include the option. Personally I'm with you, but I can't say I like/dislike him. He's just kinda there.</br>  So we all agree then?<br>Retard moe is a thing.<br>Cause there's no other explanation for best meido-ing this retard.</br></br>  Anyone here read Kuro no Maou? How is it?  Am I the only one who thinks that PA's ability is OP as fuck?<br>I mean, capable to shapeshift into Supreme Beings with only 80% of their original power makes him very versatile and unpredictable.</br>  <br>I'm still waiting for vol 8 translations to see if Hamsuke really is a girl. And I guess the rest of vol 6 to see if Ninya was a girl. Pretty sure the latter is but these threads have been filled with nerd ragers so it's hard to discuss anything related to trap/reverse trap cause it's apparently srs biz.</br>  <br>There's a reason he's best guardian, you know?</br>  <br>Well he is best girl. That's only natural.</br>  <br>Retard-moe has existed before paper existed. It just has so many names across all the languages you can't really tell anymore.</br>  <br>  Imagine he has 80% power of based Touch Me or Ulbert <br>Well damn.</br></br>  <br> I mean, capable to shapeshift into Supreme Beings with only 80% of their original power makes him very versatile and unpredictable. <br>He wouldn't be able to switch equipment during battle, however. So 80% of their strength from skills/races, but not as strong as they would be when fully decked out.</br></br>  <br>Of course it's a thing.<br><br>Did you forget nearly an entire year of "CHAIKA ON THE FRONT PAGE?" posting.</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay. God damn though. All these fucking words about nothing. Yandere fairy is cool though.</br>  <br><br><br>/a/ in charge of having  good taste. </br></br></br>  <br> he shows up <br> albedo kills him <br> Ainz goes "what the fuck' <br> They both realize its pandora actor <br> Ainz rezzes him and give albedo a look with a face that doesn't exist but she can sense his disappointment anyways. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah. that's them having low wisdom scores that would normally tell them this is totally a bad idea.<br>It's like that tale with the various sages/scientists all trying to one up another in showing off the majesty of a dead tiger they found.<br>The first one writes a Haiku<br>The next does a drawing<br>The next does an incredibly lifelike painting<br>The next makes a model<br>The next one uses taxdermy to show off it's majesty<br>Then they all get together and decided to bring it to life as a true way to show off their skills<br>The random commoner hears this and decides to GTFO as they discuss how to do so.<br>The tiger comes to life and eats everyone but the commoner.<br>High int Low wis.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He wouldn't be able to switch equipment during battle, however. <br> Cash items </br></br>  <br>No, I've seen people play dnd with both high int and wis and still make retard decisions. Cause you can't stop the player behind the character from being dumb.</br>  <br>Racial skill is enough.<br><br>Do you think in future releases, Ainz will allow PA to copy his Eclipse job and going "the goal of all life is death" together?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you really think that no one else knew about that or what?</br>  <br>That's because the player behind the character isn't actually being affected by their character's "high wisdom".</br>  <br>Oh i know. I guess i just felt like pointing out that there can be multiple sources of this.<br> I have a fellow player that I thought was absolutely brilliantly playing a low int character(couldn't be low wis since he liked to mention his high wis) due to the absolutely horrible decision making skills he displayed for months. (Not even on a low scale. Many of the BBEGs are a direct result of his bright ideas.) Then I put my foot in my mouth by mentioning his character had low int and discovered he actually had a positive int modifier.</br></br>  <br>why the fuck everyone keep calling her retard? she just simply hate human and refuse to acknowledge them. That isnt retard, its simply racist</br>  <br>Albedo should ask PA to transform to Ainz and do some kinky shit with him. It's like NTR but isnt actually NTR</br>  <br>The funny thing is he did notice her smell. He just didn't know it was from her.</br>  <br>Be unable to follow simple order is usually a sign that you're not very bright, anon.</br>  <br>nah, I can't help but think of Ainz talking like a nazi in the middle of the act. Talk about a boner killer.</br>  <br>Because he never smell a pussy before</br>  <br>Racism and being a retard usually go hand in hand.</br>  <br>She's also terminally incompetent and takes a while to accept new orders.<br><br>but that's why we love her.</br></br></br>  <br>specist*<br>She doesn't seem to think that copying the image of a human is a big deal either. <br>As for retard she can't follow momon instructions to play the part of a human or even call him by a certain name so thats where it comes from. She also tries to melee down undead dragons while being a caster.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a summon, so it's loyal.</br>  <br> summoned outsiders are loyal <br>No wonder this shit game failed.</br></br>  <br>It's retard in positive way. Retard moe.</br>  <br>Even actual retards don't think racially, many lack the mental capacity to even think in such a way.<br><br>Arrogance stupidity and indoctrination are not to be confused with being a retard, otherwise special schools would be filled with rednecks</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's was born as an Undead. It's just like the liches he creates, they're like normal people.</br>  <br>Except human beings in reality are born and raised. NPCs are ya know literally made the way they are. No different than someone being born blind.</br>  Please fucking tell me Shalltear will be in this episode?  <br>I shalltear your hopes apart.</br>  <br>nope, well, maybe. Episode 5 is more likely.</br>  <br>From the preview, it seems she will appear in the end of episode.</br>  <br>This season will have tons of her near the end, don't worry. Though if theres a second season the best scene with her will happen then.</br>    <br>Someone translated the WN version of Ainz unleashing the Super-tier spell on the Kingdom's army.<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx<wbr>6CgOVk4476Uy1PdU10LXh4Rkk/view?pli=<wbr>1</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Just at the end when Ainz gives that baller speech.</br>  <br>nope. Not going to read it till we're there.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the change of flags part.</br>  <br>He has access to all of their gear.</br>  <br>It has nothing to do with traps/reverse-traps, people generally like Mare and Aura even if it's not a whole lot. It's a feud about wiki/anti-wiki usage, the reliability of information posted here sometimes, and people blindly trusting information without sources.</br>  <br> Double unblockable Wail of Banshees. <br>Sounds like they could beat all the guardians together with that kind of firepower.</br></br>  <br>That was great, I can't wait until we get there.</br>  <br>Brilliant</br>  <br> That there was a player within the Kingdom’s forces <br>nope nope nope I'm gonna wait</br></br>  Is there a picture of albedo in her armor from the LN? Tried googling it and get papa bones or porn.  <br>No, all we know is that it's spiky and you can't tell her gender while she wears it.</br>   His eyes moved from the book and rested on a young woman who was sitting behind the counter, next to the young man. He spoke to her in a gentle voice. <br><br> “Is there a problem?” <br><br> “N-nothing at all…” <br><br> The girl blushed and lowered her face. <br><br> “I just thought… that your posture was quite striking.” <br><br> “Thank you very much.” <br><br> Sebas showed a gentle smile, causing the girl to blush even deeper. <br><br> The gray-haired gentleman Sebas was someone who you would be attracted to simply by looking at him. On top of his graceful countenance, he radiated an elegance that turned the heads of nine out of ten women, regardless of age. It could not be helped that the young woman at the counter would mindlessly stare at Sebas; it was quite common, after all. <br><br>Sebas muh boi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see how Touch Me pulled in his wife.</br>  <br>That was excellent.  I guess this means that Ainz still hasn't formally chosen an ally nation, or that he might be near choosing the Empire? </br>  <br>He probably just sits there and points at his baby old ones if anyone trys to cause shit.</br>   killing vampire loli   <br>  He chose the Empire since Kindom send an idiot envoy and piss him off, would be different if they send Gazef the man  </br>  <br>In about a year?</br>  <br>if that's what it takes</br>  <br>This is the WN, the LN is completely different story-wise.  In the WN, Ainz becomes a noble of the Empire. In the LN, Ainz becomes Sorceror King of his own independent country. </br>  <br> killing vampires <br><br>You can't kill what is already dead!</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;In the LN, Ainz becomes Sorceror King of his own independent country. </br>  <br> You'd have to fuck up extremely badly to make Ainz angry enough that he personally comes to slaughter your army. </br>  <br>fucking 10/10</br>  <br><br> It's goes more like this:<br> Empire and Kingdom send their representatives to meet Ainz. <br> Kingdom sends a dick who doesn't understand the power of Nazarick <br> Empire sends the Emperor who praises Ainz and wants to ally him <br> When they are all gone, Demiurge tells everyone that the Emperor probably plans to betray Ainz.  <br> Ainz then decides to ally himself with the Empire,but also show his might to them in case they want to betray him later on.  <br><br><br>In the WN Ainz buys the head-magician of the Empire, gets to a magic school, becomes a noble and the head-magician convinces the Emperor to get on Ainz's good side, just to eventually put Ainz on the lead of the Empire. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br><br>I prefer the LN way of doing this.<br>Nazarick is strong enough to be independent.<br>Administration will be bitch, but I'm sure they can manage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or everyone could just leave the undead lich alone and everything he does will to categorize as a natural disaster</br>  <br>In the WN, Albedo also didn't exist. Demiurge and Shaltear divide up her scenes. <br><br>Poor Shaltear, she had Ainz all to herself. It's hard to imagine Overlord now without Albedo though.</br></br></br>  <br>And now Albedo is hogging all the fanartists' attention. Well Akenest is still loyal to waifural.</br>  <br> In the WN, Albedo also didn't exist. </br>  <br>That's so strange to think about.<br><br>Having had no contact with the WN, it just seems like you couldn't replace her if you tried.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither does Mare or Victim.</br></br>   Ainz getting embarrassed because he accidentally shows two lizards having sex to Aura and Mare <br><br>My evil overlord can't possibly be this cute</br></br>  <br>Victim sort of half-exists. The author threw around the concept, but never went into details about the 8th floor except that the alliance raid wiped there.</br>  <br> Ainz starts thinking about sex ed to the dark elves </br>  <br> implying Mare isn't a total slut <br><br>Remember that he will try to outbid Albedo for the right to sleep with Ainz.<br><br>Aura is pure and best daughter though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Mare is just....innocent.</br>  <br>He is. The most innocent</br>  <br> Animefag here. I heard the MC is a villain, but 3 episodes in and he's just generic hero, just a skeleton instead of flashy angel-like shit. <br><br>his decent into becoming a full blown super evil lich-king is surprisingly swift and subtle. parts of it start from the very beginning at the end of book 1 (we might see it next episode)  when he captured some priests/warriors from the theocracy and had them tortured to death for information <br><br>book 2 continues this decent into amoral evil when he casually starts to order  witnesses killed, and leaves comrades to die <br><br>book 3 expands on it further when he  slaughters a whole guild of adventurers rather then let them witness his fight with Shelltear. <br><br>book 4 gets even more grizzly as  he slaughters/enslaves a whole race of lizardmen just for an experiment and to teach some of the floor guardians how to think outside of the box. Meanwhile Demiurge has built a human "farm" where people are held captive; skinned alive to make magic scrolls, then healed with magic to repeat the process for more magic scrolls. <br/> <br>book 5/6 well he's  setting himself up to be a world power, so you probably can guess where this takes us.  <br><br>at this pace the anime will probably end in book 3, so he'll be fairly evil by the point. the problem is he stops thinking of himself as human. Being a lich robs him of "feelings" and "compassion" and he's so much more powerful then the "humans" he starts to see them as "lesser" lifeforms. <br><br>in the end he still has moments where he has acts of mercy/compassion, but they're always calculated to gain something for the Tomb, or as some sort of obligatory repayment to TouchME</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will there ever be a manly bath scene with Ainz, Demiurge, Cocytus, and Mare?<br><br>While Albedo and Shalltear fight over who gets to peep, so by the time they arrive the only one there is Victim.</br></br></br>  <br>So Cairne village officially joins him when he becomes a world power, right?<br><br>I really want Enri to live on as a loyal servant of her savior Ainz. Especially now that we know the werewolf maido is friends with her.</br></br></br>  <br> There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a guild and potential WC items. <br>psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br><br>while WC items are deadly and potentially ruinous to papa bones, that's only if they catch him unaware. if he sees it coming they have zero chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, after they are attacked by goblins and trolls.</br>  <br> psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br><br><br>He has 12, and the Guild Weapon never comes out. It is said to rival with a WC item, but it would be one of the weak-ones, not the strong 20.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank our lord and savior Papa Bones!</br>  <br> the werewolf maido is friends with her. <br>I'm not so sure about that.</br></br>  <br> Warlord  Enri  the Bloody  is considered a subject of Ainz and Nazarick. <br><br> Since the Kingdom decided to attack Carne (which I highly doubt would qualify as a village anymore), Ainz enters the Kingdom-Empire War on the Empire's side. <br><br> Enri summons a 5,000 strong Goblin army that is supposedly professionally superior to either the Kingdom and the Empire's military. <br><br> &gt;Her army of 5000 goblins includes goblin Hoplites as core troops, goblin beast riders,17 goblin paladin on white wolf, goblin longbows, goblin magic support squad, goblin magic artillery squad, goblin medic squad, goblin musician squad, goblin assasination squad, 13 lvl43 goblin red cap honour guards and a goblin tactician dress as Zhuge Liang. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So Cairne village officially joins him when he becomes a world power, right? <br>its inside the sphere of influence, yes. and unless I've completely forgotten, I'm pretty sure they trade with the tomb. However i don't think Papa bones ever considered them important enough to make them part of his growing kingdom. its such a minor place with nothing of importance i doubt it even occurred to him.</br></br>  <br>   gobbo Zhuge Liang <br> I know what I'm using my next session. </br></br>  <br>  "Warlord Enri &amp; Her Green Horde Going Genghis Khan On Empire/Kingdom's Ass"  -spinoff when?</br>  <br> 13 lv 43 goblin red cap honor guards <br><br>these goblins are stronger than what, 99% of the humans in the new world?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Enri summons a 5,000 strong Goblin army <br><br>How?  Ainz gave her only 2 horsn and each can summon only ~20 goblins (or so). </br></br></br>  <br> psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br>No, you're thinking of The Twenty, a collective designation for the 20 consumable world-class items. AOG only had 11 WC items: two on the 8th floor, one on Papa Bones' person, one on Albedo, one in the Throne, four in the Treasury, and two unaccounted for. It's unclear if the Caloric Stone (which was used) and Atlas (which was stolen) are counted.</br></br>  <br>I think she also essentially gets the local goblin tribes and ogres to pledge loyalty to her by Volume 8. <br><br>So her goblins have "civilian" support as well as a source of recruits.</br></br></br>  <br>The item  depends on class levels, which Enri gained by leading the original 12 .</br>  <br>They probably don't despawn anymore.</br>  <br> She uses it after obtaining the Commander/General class. </br>  <br> single girl commanding army that can wipe out anything in 1000 km radius (except Nazarick of course). </br>  Can someone spoil me Tsuare's reaction to Nazarik?  <br> It's a special effect of using the Horn alongside her levels in Commander/General. I believe the effect is that it summons a goblin army in proportion to the number of opponents, which in this case, was a army of 5,000 Kingdom troops. Back in the game, the effect wasn't that overpowered, considering that players rarely gathered in such numbers and goblins were weak relative to other NPC summons. Here' as with other items from Nazarick, it's overpowering. </br>  <br>Well might as well go  raiding/nomad  style since feeding those troops is going be quite hard.</br>   hey lets give this completely innocent girl some useless summon items <br> she turns into second strongest power in the region within a year <br>Oh, wow.</br></br>  Now, what I wonder about the goblins is what will happen to them in the long run.<br><br>Supposedly they despawn the next time she blows the horn and what comes out is another goblin troupe appropriate for the threat at the time.<br><br>But what if she never blows the horn again for the rest of her life? What if they set up villages and breed and for hundreds of years goblins slowly expand and form a kingdom of their own with a separate culture and a different way of life.<br><br>What'll happen then to the descendants of the original 5,000 if after all that time someone blows the horn again when faced by two thugs in some street alley? Will the entire thing just poof away and call forth two level 10 goblins? <br><br>I'm probably overthinking this, but the idea of having your entire existence hinge on someone literally blowing hot air is a bit terrifying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The horn is single-use (Enri has/uses two of them), they disappear after use; the goblins are permanent.</br>  <br>The horns are consumables, she has nothing else to blow but goblin comfort men.</br>  <br>they both will, the question is which one will be the rightful heir</br>  I can't wait for a situation like what the 13 Heroes had to deal with to come around again. Isn't the Theocracy preparing for some doomsday event in the future? How likely is it that Ainz is going to have to step in? That event would probably only affect humans, wouldn't it? Momon might have to do something but would Magic King Ainz be tempted to help out?  <br>I suppose they aren't as ugly as most fantasy goblins. They're built like green dwarfs too</br>  <br>Cool looking party, would adventure with</br>  <br>I wanna hang out with them.</br>  So I'm understanding that shit is going to get dark in this series real fast then<br><br>Animeonly fag, how fucked up are things going to get?</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  More spoilers from Volume 9.<br><br> &gt;1. The Theocracy is the strongest of the human kingdoms<br> 2. humans are in a very precarious position. <br> 3. the dragon queen is a loli <br> 4. the dragon kingdom lost several cities to a neighboring beastman kingdom <br> 5. the humans in the cities were kill and eaten. <br> 6. places that are further away form humans land have been known to serve 6mo old unborn babies. <br> 7. the dragon kingdom pays tribute to the Theocracy every year and the theocracy is expect to help the dragon kingdom in its fight but this time no help has been sent. <br> 8.

Demi made him one.</br>  <br>More like<br> Femurs for the bone throne! </br></br>  <br>It just needs proper cushion now.</br>  <br> filename </br>  <br>And yet Demiurge can summon more and stronger demons by himself. Or kill every single goblin with a Nuke.</br>  <br> &gt;3. the dragon queen is a loli </br>  why do they call him momonga?<br>whats his name, momonga or ainz?</br>  <br>Pay attention anon</br>  <br>Momonga was his gamer name. He uses the guilds name in hopes that once his name spreads people from the game will notice the famous guild name and come and contact him.</br>  <br>Best be trolling.</br>  <br>Momonga uses his infamous guild name because other players from Yggdrasil might be there, and if they hear word of him they would realize he was a player as well.</br>  <br>Victim is a support guardian, he sets off some crazy unspecified shit when killed. Ainz didn't want to bring him out earlier because he didn't know if NPCs could be resurrected in the new world.<br><br><br>There are at least two WC items on the 8th floor--one belonging to the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary Guardian and one part of the environment itself--but Victim is unrelated to either.<br><br><br><br>We don't know exactly what Victim does. The stuff about the 1,500-man raid wiping on the 8th floor is from the WN, where Victim didn't exist; in the LN Victim is stated to have some sort of powerful sealing-type magic activated on death (either from being attacked or self-destruction) and thus serves as support for the rest of the floor.<br><br>The debuff-bomb is just one theory; others are that he buffs everything, or actually debuffs the other 8th floor mobs because they're too powerful to control otherwise (even the other Guardians are forbidden from going to the 8th floor because it's too dangerous).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>got it, thanks anons</br></br>  <br>Do you even pay attention?</br>  <br><br>I'm sure Demi can work on it. He already uses human skin for magic scrolls and then heals his victims to harvest again later, he could make a nice cushy bone recliner with regenerating flesh-cushions.</br></br>  <br>Oh god hopefully Demiurge never learns vicissitude.</br>  <br> only 30 usd <br>Order arleady placed<br>Awaiting shipment</br></br></br>  <br>Vicissitude is the poor man's protean. Bone shit doesn't even cause aggravated damage.</br>  <br>But you can't put dicks on your knees with protean, anon!</br>  <br>You have a very practical mind, anon.</br>  <br>My main worry is that he'd start flesh crafting a new chair out of flesh that starts screaming when you sit on it.</br>  <br>He doesn't need to, Shalltear is close enough.</br>  Pandora's Actor hype  <br>When does he get proper screen time in the LN?</br>  <br>Shortly before Shalltear fight in volume 3 iirc.</br>  <br>Volume 3, so we'll see him in the anime by season's end.</br>  <br><br>Well I meant after that, I'm already at volume 5 and he hasn't even made an appearance.</br></br>  <br>Soon. <br><br> This Ainz is PA. Also, he is present in vol. 7.  </br></br></br>  <br>I'm more excited for that Albedo and Ainz scene.</br>  <br>Yeah, the Mausoleum was a good part.</br>  I wonder why there's a 300 year difference between the arrival of the 8 Greed Kings[/spoiler] and the  2  of the  13 Heroes  and a 200 year difference between the  2 Heroes  and  Ainz.   <br>Where he talks about the statues and stuff? I was slightly sad when he said why he put them there.</br>  <br>Just realized that Demiurge is carrying Victim like a baby.</br>  <br>I think you did something wrong anon</br>  <br>There had probably been other players around. <br>Also, 600 years there were the 6 Gods.</br></br>  <br>Are these scans filtered somehow because they always seem so blurry</br>   Aura and Ainz riding Hamsuke together <br>2cute2handle</br>  <br>Volume 6 or so when he's pretending to be Ainz while Ainz off being Momon.</br>  will nazarick be conquered just like all the players that tried to take over the world in the end?  <br>Supposedly players showed up every 100 years. It's just that the degree of involvement varies according to the resources that they had.  The 8 Greed Kings transferred with their guild castle, as Ainz did with Nazarick. Others are more isolated, only impact certain localities and are easily contained and dealt with by PDL. </br>  <br>well at least he has something to do now. Was kind of sad that he was stuck in the treasury room with nothing to really do.</br>  <br>Yeah. Fuck phones.</br>  <br>Does PDL know of the one supposedly lying low in the Holy Kingdom or something?</br>  <br>Some had descendant? Guess the really was no way back if they stayed there long enough to have kids and shit.</br>  <br>Wait is there a player there? I thought so far only Ainz was known.</br>  <br>Apparently in the WN. Don't know about the LN yet?</br>  <br>It's not that they had descendants. I mean that players from the MMO show up in the New World at 100 year intervals.  Some of them live long enough to have descendants, but most of the time those children are far weaker than the players that show up. </br>  <br>I thought Ainz said there wasn't one. When he was fighting the Kingdom didn't he say no player was present considering they hadn't attacked him while he was casting his huge spell?</br>  <br> Lying low <br> Show up to attack a Lich <br><br>I don't think so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's intelligence net is restricted to the Kingdom and the Empire. He's relatively clueless of anything that happens outside, and he prohibits his servants from journeying too far from Nazarick and support.</br>  <br> Make massive plans in case there's another PC. <br> There isn't <br> "Fuck it, let's just fuck shit up!" <br>Ainz's paranoia is kind of adorable.</br></br></br></br>  How is Ainz planning on boning Shalltear if he's got no boner? Shit makes no sense.  <br>He was already casting the spell, might as well let it go off.</br>  LN is light novel... what the fuck is WN?  <br>web</br>  <br>Weeb novel</br>  <br>Web Novel I believe.</br>  <br> Spider's home  novel</br>  <br>He considers all the NPCs his adoptive children. He isn't going to bone any of them.</br>  <br>Western Novel</br>  <br>Well he's going to have to one day. I want preggers Albedo, and I want to see mini liches and succubae running around.</br>  <br>Web Novel. It's how a lot of series get started nowadays. They publish online because it is free, they become popular, and attracts a publisher's attention to turn it into a LN. It saves money for the publisher, because they don't need predict whether or not a new series would be popular.</br>  <br>Well apparently Albeido is going to rape him at some point so you'll get your wish.</br>  <br>nah, she just get's put in timeout for that</br>    <br> He isn't going to bone any of them. <br>Not with that attitude he won't.</br></br>  <br> I want preggers Albedo <br>I never knew how much I wanted to see this until now. I'm ready to commission this shit if need be.</br></br>  <br>Where the heck is this from?</br>  <br>That ain't PA. <br>Didn't that scene have Ainz remembering  Touch Me &amp; Ulbert fighting seeing Sebas and Demiurge arguing with each other? PA couldn't possibly know that stuff. </br></br>  <br>the LN</br>  <br>Looks like from volume 8 of the LN.</br>  <br>Volume 8.<br><br> Ainz declares how he loves all of his comrades creations, including and in front of Albedo (with predictable results.) </br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love crazy girls.</br>  So, succumbing to my hype I started reading the LN's. Starting Volume 4 now   (lizardmen) and so far NOTHING HAS FUCKING REALLY HAPPENED. WHAT THE FUCK I HAD SUCH HOPES.    <br>Is this translated? I'm reading the skythewood translations and they're up to 5ish.</br>  <br>You don't want to read about the daily lives or lizardmen? C'mon anon.</br>  <br>Oh boy. Can't wait until the translation's ready for the volume.</br>  <br>There are spoiler summaries up on the wiki, as well as snippets all over the internet.</br>  <br> book 9 (and probably book 10) will be about raising his reputation to an even higher level. <br><br>Bit of a gripe I have with WN/LNs in general, they're ambitious with far-planned endgames and long future arcs (which I love, LH very much included), but they often don't make it there, at least not in a timely manner.<br>I'm not big on MT but can really appreciate how quickly we got the full length of the story, with an actual endpoint.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. We're only up to v5ch3</br>  <br>Author is trying to get you to feel for the lizardman's side. Just keep reading. It gets way fucking better.</br>  <br>at least chapter 3 was good.<br>i couldn't give a shit less about climb. at least the lizards had some personality.</br></br>  <br><br><br>No, I mean at all in the entire story so far.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a different type of screaming, though.<br><br><br>Well, he is an angel fetus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I suddenly feel the need to reproduce with her.</br>  <br>Then you're hopeless.</br>  <br>Tig ol bitties and child birthin hips. Mate with her already Ainz.</br>  <br> has no dick </br>  <br>You should probably drop it if you can't tell that stuff has happened in 4 volumes.</br>  <br> Implying he doesn't know a rape spell because he's a wizard. </br>  <br> Ainz gets transported to NW. <br> Ainz embarks on a journey to gather info. <br> Ainz collects a whole bunch of info on the world. <br> Momon does stuff for the glory of Nazarick. <br> Chair rebels, Ainz gets more info on WC items. <br> Ainz declares the goals of Nazarick. <br><br>What the hell are you talking about, nothing's happened? If you were looking for shounen fightan, even that's happened a bit. What are you complaining about?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He can always improvise</br>  What happened to Kei Seke Koku afterwards?  <br>Can somebody dump the rest?</br>  <br>still with the bitch that is having trouble healing after taking the chair's lance.</br>  I wonder if they're going to make Ainz yell out all his boosts in the chair fight. He uses like 20 different ones.  <br>Wait, didn't Ainz destroy it to save Enfirea or something?</br>    <br>Fucking sharknado.</br>    <br>That's from the WN right?</br>  <br> Kei Seke Koku <br><br>you're mixing up your artifacts. The Kie Seke Koku is the brainwashing qipao.</br></br></br>     1 day and 16 hours until angel curbstomping   <br>I guess so.</br>     reading volume 4 <br> this cute lizardman romance </br>  <br>s- sugoi</br>  <br>These spoilers are from the LN.</br>    Wow I never thought that Cocytus would be Narberal levels of dumb  <br>Is that Fluder?</br>  <br>It's emperor faglord</br>  <br>At least he has the capacity to learn from his mistakes, unlike retard moe.</br>  <br>Cocytus isn't dumb, he just doesn't get out much.</br>  You know, for episode 12, they are going to go all the way up to the part where he launches his super spell, and then we'll have to wait a week for the fight.  <br>On on Jircniv's right, the old man.</br>    <br>That is PA, Ainz comes later, after Sebas  Has proven his loyalty.  </br>  <br>But Cuckytus will never be as cute as her due to that.<br>Narberal is cute!<br>CUTE!</br></br></br>  hot DAMN so-bin  <br>Fuck you, Cocytus-sensei is moe as fuck</br>  <br><br>It's him.</br></br>  who's PDL?  <br> Platinum Dragon Lord <br>Pope Duran Lesus.</br></br>  <br> Narberal is cute! <br> CUTE! <br>Best Maid</br></br></br>   Demi puching Albedo <br>Oh god my sides</br>  <br>abs of steel baby</br>  <br><br> This will never be animated </br></br>  <br>Bah, no wonder I missed that. It's literally implied to be PA in one sentence where  Sebas comments on Ainz's exit being more theatrical than usual </br>  <br>PA probably hams up the evil overlord super hard as Ainz.</br>  Reminder:<br>If you don't care about spoilers and need Overlord drug, on baka the prologue, chapter 1 and 2/10 of chapter 2 of vol. 7 are translated.</br>  I just realized something<br>If Twins; and Chair;s creators were siblings<br>And their creations are their children<br>Then shouldn't they be cousins?<br>Why does Shaltear that she and Aura are pretty much sisters due to that?<br>Was that a mistranslation or author's (un)intended mistake?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe as an OVA? Please.</br>  <br>Why would they skip straight to 7? To what end?</br>  <br>when pigs fly</br>  <br>The creations themselves don't consider each other as the Supreme Being's children, they consider themselves to be created in their image.</br>  <br>Different translators not wanting to intefe re with each other</br>  <br>probably children</br>  <br><br>It's probably just the influence of their creators on them.<br>Their creators were siblings so when the holes in their personalities got filled they ended up as the type to treat each other as siblings. Also what  said.</br></br></br>  <br>Hmm it may be so that I completly forgot about that which would explain this confusion</br>  <br>Why wouldn't they do 6 then or something? Jesus its going to be ages before anyone catches reaches 7.</br>  <br>Because 5 and 6 are self contained as is 7.</br>  <br>this<br><br>Don't ask me WHY the guy wanted to do 7, but oh well. I think Kaezar is doing 6. I could be wrong though. Wonder how far he's gotten if so.</br></br></br>  <br>None of them outright states that ideology but Ainz is the only one thinking of them as their children.<br><br>And the creations themselves look up to created in their creators images or ideals in differing amounts.<br><br>Or that's what I have gleamed from the small tidbits when the servants discuss among each other without Ainz around.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger I couldn't give a fuck if they are flashbacks, flashforwards or an entire volume about them playing poke, I just want to read them in order.</br>  <br>The rate it used to be 7 would have been finished around the same time that 6 got finished so it would have actually been good timing. It also means that it doesn't prevent skythewood from doing vol 6 translations if he finishes vol5 quickly.<br>TLDR how about you get some self control and not read ahead if it bothers you that much.</br></br>  <br>then read them in order? Nobody is forcing you to read ahead.</br>  <br> Drama CD <br> Animated <br>Pick one</br></br></br>  i probably won't read it yet, but who were the people in the invader party in vol 7? adventurers? what rank?  <br><br>I don't read ahead thats the problem.</br></br>  <br> who were the people in the invader party in vol 7? adventurers? what rank? <br>They were  workers, ex-adventurers who stopped working with the guild to take on more risky/questionable jobs for more money. The guys that invade Nazarick were described to be equivalent to a mythril rank adventurer team. </br></br>  <br>Read more! If you read Volume 7, they are appearing again.</br>  <br>In a sense, you have only seen PA, Sebas and Shalltear talk about stuff that reflects this hypothesis.<br><br>It's bit farfetched that all of them think even remotely same way about their creators and "settings", like Sebas actually considered his chivalry to be a curse to some degree.</br></br></br>  <br>Does the Sentient Orb ever really get used after being handed to Hamsuke?<br><br>For that matter, does Ainz ever really figure out how it works, and how to safely use it?</br></br></br>  <br>it's latest novel, LN<br>volume 9 i think</br></br>  <br> safely use it <br>That would be implying it's a threat in the first place.</br></br>   Just finished dtama CD <br> My face </br>  <br> Gazef will join to pap bones cause or will be killed later? </br>  <br><br>What's the story?</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Cute dryad asks Ainz to kill giant tree<br>He turns it into christmas tree<br>Also why are her abs so damn hard?</br></br></br>  <br> Do you want to be spoiled? </br>  <br>She's also lovers with a young man who can use any item he's given, regardless of stats. Who is eternally in debt to Ainz. Not to mention, his grandmother as well is in debt to Ainz.</br>  <br>Killed?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> Lovers <br>He'd be more luckier to get a spitroast with goblin strap-ons from the sisters than actually scoring on Enri.</br></br>  <br>  his grandmother as well is in debt to Ainz. <br>She's not in debt, she totally belong to ainz now.</br></br>  What's the CD stuff?<br> It is only in japanese? </br>    <br>Drama CDs?<br><br>They're like mini stories that only have voices. The first drama CD for Overlord is completely subbed, but there's no word of more.</br></br></br>  I have notice some lack of this threads in /a/  Good, because now they're filled with the kind of shit that you've decided to start off with.  <br>Motherfucking this<br><br>Also, is there any godtier mango like that one ?</br></br></br>  <br>Or that one ?</br>  Remember, don't leave your imouto alone too long. She might slut it up with your best friend  That's what you get, you cheating harlot  <br>Onii-chan did nothing wrong. Fuck that little slut.</br>  <br>Onii-chan was not giving his imouto the proper amount of love, so she looked for it elsewhere. Everyone in that manga was in the wrong</br>  Same author as Nichibros  Probably because everyone is tired of all the /v/ermin and reddit fucks who come straight to them and complain nonstop about being told to conform or leave.  <br>This manga was trying so hard to make the MC out to be the bad guy though<br> How dare you get angry at your best friend for fucking your elementary school sister! <br> Wow, you won't let them date despite only being at least 10 years apart? <br> It's your fault our deadbeat father left us because you kept calling him out on being a deadbeat! <br> You're working hard to support me and get an education, but since you're not spending enough time with me I'm going to go have sex with your friend! </br></br></br></br></br>      <br>I know what you are trying to say, but that doesn't mean that every character in that manga isn't a piece of shit<br> Onii-chan is brutally honest, and works to hard for his sister <br> Imouto is growing up and wants to be loved, and given that onii-chan is always working, seduces his friend instead <br> Friend is an idiot for letting an elementary schooler seduce him, the only good thing he did was not come back in the end <br> Dad was a complete deadbeat who abandoned his children because his son called him out on it. <br>Yes, a lot of emphasis is put on MC being a piece of shit, but that is just to distract you from the rest of the cast being fuckers too</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How about that  suffering ?  <br>That was my point, MC is hardly the bad guy in the story. Sure, he's a pretty unpleasant guy but everyone else is just as bad or worse.</br>  C A N O N<br>A<br>N<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br>     tfw   the magazine fell through and the story never got picked back up   <br>This is such a depressing manga. Sure, the artstyle looks cute, but damn. Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. The MC is a hardworking, but hard to like guy who just wants to care for his sister. The friend is a victim of circumstance.</br>    Be gentle when you dump the crazy ones  <br>The real kicker is that she get's off scot-free after shanking her ex-boyfriend in front of his sister. Sure, she's in a psych ward, but there were really no consequences for her</br>  <br> victim of circumstances <br><br>Yeah how can We blame him, it's just a peadophile that banged his best friend's little sister who's in elementary school behind his back while that friend worked his ass off for the only family that's left for him. (Yeah the pure little girl that the victim of circumstances deflored)</br></br></br>  <br>Used goods like her won't even sell at a clearance sale.</br>    <br> Woman cut her hair.  <br><br>Didn't read but dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, let me rephrase. He was a victim of circumstance, right up until he kept their relationship going. If he had cut her off after the first time she seduced him, I would have more sympathy. But, as it turns out, little girl pussy is just too dank.</br>  <br>You shut the fuck up. She was more pure than your waifu.</br>  Let's get some decent pages going and not endless boring conversations over 8 panels.  If there is a third, I hope MC stops being such a massive faggot, and gives in to the crazy, qt, time bending mothgirl  Getting people into Mx0 knowing the ending.<br><br>YOU MONSTER FRISBEE</br></br>  <br>  Fuck you  </br>  <br>I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of  heart-breaking suffering </br>  <br>Fuck.<br><br>You.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone should read it just to condemn japan for their shit taste.<br><br><br>What's the author up to these days ? Still making oneshots because all his series are getting cancelled ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone dropped that little gem in a father's day thread. I was caught flatfooted, and I fucking cried like a bitch.</br>  <br>Gets me everytime</br>  <br>Fuck. You. Anon. Fuck you right in your stupid face</br>  <br>Why does anyone read this shit series?</br>  <br>There are two hints in the biggest panel.</br>  How about, instead of suffering, some tall girls instead?  i don`t get it   fucks waifus and they came <br> turns strong men gar in the pants <br> even hot aunt is beginning to succumb to the true Genji power <br><br>Minamoto is the harem king we need</br></br></br></br>  <br>Posting a better page from later on when it gets a bit less lewd that isn't a downscaled jpeg from some reader site, because more people should read this series.</br>    <br>He fucked a girl in elementary school. He is not a victim of circumstance.</br>  <br> Anime never <br> Maybe it's a good thing </br></br>  <br>Updates when?</br>  <br>No, you are not a victim of circumstance even if you are only once seduced by an elementary school student.</br>  <br>Play Persona Q.</br>  <br>Never ever.</br>        Nothing makes my heart go doki-doki quite like stupid vampire girls falling in love            <br>Yeah, so sad she died.</br>  <br>It's really ambiguous, but there is no evidence to say whether she survived or not. For all we know, she died, and he's burning incense, and he see's her ghost. On the flip side of that, maybe the white hair is from the stress of her surgery, he's cooking and she just came home.</br>  <br>I'll never get why didn't the MC jump all over her. Guess that his charm was not being like everyone else but then again, what was the point?</br>    <br>so first I thought maybe they weren't actually fucking, maybe just some kissing or whatever. then she drops the bomb when she talks to him later about how when she grows up, it'll stop hurting when they have sex.</br>  <br>They're both nude. There was definately some little girl sexing going on here. Plus the look of shame the friend is giving off, and the horror on imouto's face</br>  <br> Naked on the bed <br> Maybe they weren't actually fucking <br>Anon, you can't possibly be this dense.</br></br></br>  <br> she means walk me home gently </br>  <br> walk her home gently  <br>every fucking time</br></br>  <br>maybe he spilled coffee on both their clothes so their only choice was being nude</br>    <br>My little anon can't possibly be this dense</br>  <br>This is such nonsense. He did what he could given how busy he was. His friend is a huge asshole for calling him immature and shit. He was, at first, but manned up when his retarded dad (who explained nothing) took the advice of a child and left.<br><br>Fuck, I'm still mad.</br></br></br>    <br>at least the omakes at the end served as a sort of palate cleanser after reading that mess.</br>    <br>HE COULD'VE SAVED HER</br>  <br>This. It's only good when it's against their will and it upsets them.</br>  <br>She even asked for salvation with those subtle "let's just go out"</br>  <br>Ah, yuri: just what I want from my trap manga.<br><br>Prunus Girl went to shit way too fast. Had great potential too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, they were worth reading to calm down. Plus, ending with yuri was good. I fucking love yuri.</br></br>  <br>The novelty wore off pretty quick. Though it was a happy end.</br>  <br>I this worth the read?</br>              <br>I'll riot if this doesn't end in happiness.<br><br>C'mon, you've got an infinite amount of time to get it right moth-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>This manga is fucking hilarious. Love the scumbag MC who has a thigh fetish.</br>      <br>Moth-chan chose a shit husbando, if he'll run away from her like that, and call her a monster. Then again, she did off his mom because she got in the way.<br> That lying fucking title <br>I thought it was going to be happy, with moth-chan actually being pregnant</br></br></br>    He did not deserve anything that happened to him in this arc.  ;_;       <br>no, its strange ive been here for 5 years and ive almost never seen a /a/ talk about this manga even though it has good art, good story, an anime adoption, neat /k/ stuff, gooks actually looking like gooks and is still ongoing</br>          <br>Is this Naze Toudouin Seiya 16-sai wa Kanojo ga Dekinai no ka? I searched by the guy's name but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>name?</br>  <br>Sauce, yandex and reverse gives nothing.</br>  This manga made me fucking sob. Not light crying, actual sobs of pain.      <br>Reiroukan Kenzai Nariya.<br><br>Yes they do.</br></br></br>        <br>I love this one, mostly because every tradition and custom in the manga is so familiar to me since I'm  Turkish . Especially this part made me cry so much.</br>  <br>dont forget shes not wearing the right season uniform</br>      <br>thanks</br>    <br>So was she a normal girl possessed by something?</br>    <br>This guy looks like I wouldn't mess with him.</br>    whatever you do, don't click on the image    <br>Fuck, i can't remember the name for this.<br><br>The girls name starts with a K right?</br></br></br>    The NTR  what does /a/ think of shinsekai yori?  bonobos/10  <br>9/10</br>  9/10<br><br>tentatively my favorite anime of all time</br></br>  Dropped because of Homoshit  Just rewatched it recently.<br><br>The beginning is a bit dragging, then it really picks up. Overall 9+/10, my 2nd favorite Anime.</br></br>  <br>I'm never sure if this is bait or serious.<br><br>Regardless, the yuri and yaoi of Shinsekai Yori was justified, and people who complain about it remind me of my idiotic friend who thinks Holo being naked in the OP of Ookami to Koushinryou is ecchi.</br></br></br>  I gave it 9/10, I thought that the story. atmosphere and soundtrack were all great.<br><br>Sadly A-1 was also doing SAO at the time and gave more attention to it than to Shinsekai Yori.</br></br>  <br>I'm about halfway through the novel and I gotta say its a great read.<br><br>Also wareta ringo is a good song</br></br></br>  https://mega.co.nz/#!XMkR3bjD!Nykwv<wbr>mTMVgY65_nEDvpnJoGR_3Es_uqVRASo-5MU<wbr>8LM<br><br>OST's BEST</br></br></wbr></wbr>  9/10 seems to be the consensus, the slow beginning and kinda obvious end twist keep it from being 10.<br><br>Queerats sengoku is best sengoku</br></br>  It's pretty gayshit but it's not bad, per se.  <br>It's more hetshit than anything.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Do you faggots really think a number out of ten when asked what you think about a show?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/mal/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> MAL invented number ratings </br>  <br>Satoru ends up with Saki, you do know that, right?</br>  <br>That is so true, Shun goes away and Satoru ends up with Saki, it is very het, especially toward the end. Especially after learning that Mamoru and Maria had a child.</br>  <br>When was that ever implied? The problem is that people posting an arbitrary number to show how they feel about an anime isn't quality discussion and never would be. Are you retarded?</br>  <br>It seems that you are the retard and a newfag at that.<br><br/></br></br>  saki was delicious  This is one of those shows that the majority who watched it until the end likes and has this really religious cult like following and ends up being praised everywhere by this cult-ish fanbase.  <br>Not like there's anyone else left to end up with by the end of the series.<br><br>Also if if I remember they weren't really 'gay' in that aspect. In their society homosexual relationships were normal - and encouraged - among kids until they became adults. Heterosexual relationships were allowed once they had completed that pairing ceremony.<br>Not to mention that Saki and Satoru had sex in the novel after they failed to bring Maria and Mamoru back. Hell Saki even stated that she had experience in sexually pleasing other girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He asked what was thought about it, and got 9/10 love it.<br><br>People aren't obligated to write an essay when asked what they think about something.</br></br></br></br>  I just happened to finish this yesterday. Jesus christ the humans were fucking dense.<br>Kind of wonder why no one commented on Satoru's nerves of steel. He faired just as well as Saki, yet only she seemed to gain recognition from it.<br><br>Question: Where did Squealer get the technology from? They thought about the possibility that he had obtained a False Minoshiro, yet I don't think we ever got a clear definite answer to it.</br></br></br>  2/10<br><br>It's gay shit with awful pacing, characters and animation.</br></br>  Casanova scans are out.  <br>Maybe in the next chapter? I'm curious about Alice, Ryou and Hayama too.</br>  <br>The thing is, everyone but Alice is doing their stuff without incidents.<br>They are not going to reveal elite 10 specialties and Erina's food hasn't been shown in the manga barring egg benedict.</br></br>  <br><br>We all do anon.<br><br>We all do.</br></br></br></br>  128 chapters in and no real Souma and Erina romantic development has happened yet.<br>I wonder if he's still going to go through with his oneshot ideas.</br>  <br>I wouldn't expect much of anything romance wise while the characters are first years. Tsukuda has definitely chosen to take things very slowly.</br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br>buyfag.moe</br>  C A N A D A<br>A<br>N<br>A<br>D<br>A</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>This one was up first.</br>  I don't even want them anyways.

This one isn't.</br>  <br>GUYS WHAT HAPPENS IF I PRE ORDER SOMETHING AND THEY DON'T GIVE ME A PAYMENT E-MAIL BY THE RELEASE DATE?!<br><br>BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED</br></br></br>  <br>Not Canadian. So no risk there.</br>  my dick  <br><br>The hell's with their stomachs</br></br>  <br>Sounds like you need a Desu Moines with AA spec and double in your life. It eats planes instantly so there is no fear in the ocean.</br>  <br>Fuck yeah, same here.</br>  <br>Calm down. The day it's released might be the day the store you bought it from gets it in stock, so they might not send you an invoice right away.<br><br>Did you have anything else in the order, too, that might have delayed it?</br></br></br>  <br>Whoever sculpted these needs to learn some anatomy. Those tummies are way too lumpy. Ideally, it protrudes at the belly button and slowly comes down to her cunny. No other lumps between unless she just had some tight underwear on that left a crease.</br>  <br>Fat or pregnant.</br>  <br>Stretch marks.</br>  <br>nope, only one thing, and now it's displayed as back order on amiami. it's been like that for a few days now</br>  <br>Liposuction.</br>  <br>ripples from being hara-panned</br>  <br>Then amiami might have taken too many preorders and they're looking to find more figures. Just wait, it'll come eventually..</br>  <br>The more I look at these figures, the more I don't want them. Looks like I won't have to take my chances with Canadian Customs after all.</br>  <br><br>It's funny, I always imagine buyfags to be pretty chill.</br></br>  Is this dangerous for Canada?  <br>ah, okay. thanks, i was scared<br><br>also,  it's a mug </br></br></br>  ペロペロペロペロ  <br>That's what happens when you try to cheat using a 3D modeller instead of good old fashioned hand sculpting.</br>  <br>No she doesn't even look young and it's not overly sexual.</br>  <br>This is dangerous for Canada.</br>  <br> not overly sexual <br> showing cunny </br></br>  Is there anywhere i can see all the wonfes figurines?  <br>I am brave enough to own many things, but this is not one of those things.</br>  So what's the deal with this?<br><br>Did we ever see the Panzer IV with those shields on the tracks in the anime? Will they re-release the Nendoroid Petits?<br><br>Surely we should have more information by now</br></br></br></br>  Post them.  <br>Get rekted Canada</br>  <br>We have ourselves a real life pedophile here.</br>  <br>japan</br>  <br>It's the Ausf. H. It's the upgrade they used in the later half of the manga and anime.</br>  <br>I would say wait on coloring/shading. Many skinny, young girls do have that weird look to them. Go get some pizza.</br>  <br>Once the paint and shading is on them it will make sense. I really don't see a problem with these because this picture maybe screwing with perspective.<br><br>Source: Ten million years of model painting experience, 500 hours of Microsoft paint experience.</br></br></br>  I think I'm finally going to start getting some male figures. There's been a few I've wanted but they would look out of place surrounded by so many females, but between this and Archer with Shirou's hair, I think it's about time.    How did this turn into this?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bOM<wbr>qR4Y_-8U</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I would so get this is breasts weren't exposed like that. I don't know why since I have lewder.</br>  <br><br> Nico's mouth <br><br>What the fuck.</br></br></br></br>  FREEing a shit.  So did Koufuku Grafitti get anything at all? I really wanted some nendos but didn't see any.  <br>This. <br><br>It'll look so much better</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this? Image search not helping. Not getting anywhere with tags on MFC.</br>  <br>Those figures aren't even that bad. <br><br>The fuck is with all these lumps? Does she have stomach cancer?</br></br></br>  <br><br>is there a breakdown of all the release anywhere? been at work all day</br></br>    <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287569</wbr></br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br>I'm still trying to figure that out. No matter how I look at this, I am counting two extra lumps per side.</br>  <br>http://whl4u.jp/wh22/exhibit/galler<wbr>y/<br>A bunch of the figures are in here, you can also check #wf2015s on twitter for all the other stuff</br></wbr></br>  I'm going to put Rin's dog leash on her like the bitch she is.  <br>Most definitely. Yes.</br>  <br>Thanks man. Didn't spot her with the flat_chest tag. Guess sort by release date wasn't a good idea.</br>  <br>Yeah, sort by addition date is better if you're looking for something specific. She has no release date yet.</br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  <br>There's literally no difference between 3D and clay sculpting nowadays.</br>  <br>Well. As a start, you can hit up MFC and search by the tag "wf2015s" then filter stuff from there.</br>  <br><br>thanks, have a chaika</br></br>  Anyone collect Chaos TCG? I'm thinking about getting into it. How many boxes are usually needed to make a set?  <br><br>I tell you some secret</br></br>  Does this shit get checked at customs when you buy them?    Forever a GK.  <br>That's a stupid fucking question.</br>  <br> spoonfeeding </br>  <br><br>only in canadia</br></br>  <br><br>Yes. They check to make sure you have good taste. If you're taste is shit they confiscate your stuff.</br></br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  <br>Damn shame Tougou's still nowhere to be seen, but there was a lot of unexpected stuff that I'll definitely buy.<br>Especially Lal'c holy shit.</br></br>  <br>np</br>  <br>The lumps right above the iliac crest are external obliques. Just really odd looking ones. But yeah, that shit's all fucked up. Not to mention the gracilis isn't anywhere close to it's origination point.</br>  <br>That is beautiful.</br>  <br> external obliques <br>Now I see it. Yes, that makes sense with human anatomy... but damn, it's weird to see obliques that big on an otherwise skinny little girl.</br></br>  Why do people care so much about how the anatomy compares to real people when their eyes are alien eyes?  Cool, I guess... I'm always happy for more 2hu nendos, and SA is my favorite game, but I can't help feeling like this is going to be a disappointment. What kind of accessories could she possibly have besides hearts and... more hearts?<br><br>Really wish they went with Rin and Utsuho instead. That would be awesome. Rin could have a little wheelbarrow and zombie fairies, and Okuu could have fire effects and a removable control rod...

Either of an existing series, or with original characters.<br> This is not a request for free manga. Just curious. </br>  <br>Because a lot of them have become viciously protective of their waifus, and attack both anyone else who requests them and any artists who dare to draw them.

IF I DIEEEE LET ME DIEEEE<br><br>LET HIM LIIIIIVE</br></br>  <br>You will live, Papa, you're going to live!<br>It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!</br></br>  <br><br>This looks totally awesome, I'm a big digimon fan.<br><br>Do you have a blog or a deviantart profile?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I LIVE I DIE, I LIVE AGAIN!</br>  <br>WITNESS ME!</br>  <br>hey man, I saw your post in the last thread but it died before I could reply. I actually dunno what kind of tutorial I could do that you would find useful. if there's something in particular you'd like t hear my process for, let me know and ill see if I can put something together.</br>  <br>I actually have a better idea after seeing <br><br>Draw Hidenori Tabata as a bathhouse owner fighting against Yoshitake Tanaka dressed as a soldier and Tadakuni dressed as an RPG-knight.</br></br></br>  Requesting Kabaru doing a naked apron to emphasize her amazing ass. Angle and pose is up to the artist.  When does the Waifu thread "end"? Tonight?  <br>Yeah, depending on who's been delivered it can end early tonight or early monday. Why do you ask?</br>  <br>Because these threads are practically dead until then and I like these threads.</br>  <br>Yeah the general is normally pretty cool. I would try to avoid it monday though, if there's drama from the WWD the day before its gonna be awful. This weekend has been calm surprisingly so I think this time it might be alright.</br>  <br>The weekend was pretty chill actually.</br>  <br>Yeah, some pretty awesome drawfriends really made a difference. It's nice that things didn't go to shit from the start.</br>  <br><br>Shitposters got banned early. It seems to be 2-3 kids shitting up the thread.</br></br>  <br>Did they really? I missed it. How bad was it?</br>  <br>God willing they stay banned for a few.</br>  <br>What about Riasfag? He got banned for "ban evasion" when he didn't do anything. Also, it's kind of funny that the Etna mass delivery did nothing to kill the threads but cement Etnafag as a greedy cunt.</br>  <br>Well I think it helped too that that attempt to get a rile out of the thread was posted early, and was mostly ignored after the first thread died.</br>  <br>/ghost/ pls go</br>  <br>He's right.</br>  <br>Not like getting banned actually matters. Takes about 5 seconds to fix unless your ISP is annoying about it.</br>  <br>Riasfag WAS evading his ban from a week or two ago and anyone who knows anything knows mass delivery recipients are more victims than greedy cunts.</br>  <br>I would take a mass of decent deliveries of mai waifu even if it made people angry at me.</br>  <br>Etnafag literally asked Chronoirebro to draw her and he knew damn well that the mass delivery was coming, and still requested. He's not getting any sympathy from me.</br>  <br>Imagine your waifu's name in place of every "Oora!".</br>  <br>I don't know what that means. The fuck is an Oora?</br>  <br>Wow.</br>  <br>Whether he was aware of it or not they weren't going to come in to save him from the shitposting.<br><br>Honestly I just wish they would keep their stuff to themselves, we could have more weekends like this is that was the case. <br><br>I saw someone mention they have something going in the IRC but they never involve their antics in the thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can I get a pregnant Tsugumi in a white dress having Raku's head on her lap listening to the baby  <br><br> no Immortan Joe and his Warboys collage </br></br>  <br><br> Immortan Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Fund it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You won't get hate unless you're a faggot though.</br>  <br>Maybe he was ban evading, but that still doesn't mean it was because of drawthread drama.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Why isn't this a thing? Take my money please.</br></br>  <br>This thing</br>  <br> tfw was witnessed this weekend by my small group of warboys <br>Feels good.</br></br>  <br> and anyone who knows anything knows mass delivery recipients are more victims than greedy cunts. <br>no, the only "victims" were the ones that acted like greedy cunts after the fact</br></br>    <br>Nice! Is there someone else in front of Kaede?</br>  <br>Sorry to be dull as shit but is this Iggy JJBA as Arthur?</br>  <br>Is the Goddess from the last drawing with her?</br>  <br>Yes<br><br>A passer by was required but as for it`s identity, only the OR knows</br></br></br>  <br>I need more excuses to draw lewd witches</br>  <br>This</br>  Requesting Riders Medusa and Astolfo making out.  <br>This was already delivered. It was good.</br>  Requesting Eila being bullied for using crocs.  <br>Thanks. I missed it. Disregard the request then.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>That was really good. Thanks to the artist!</br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Mio as a super villain blasting Ritsu as a superhero with an energy blast.<br><br>Mio should have a mask and a miniskirt while Ritsu can have whatever.</br></br>  <br>Hey thanks for reply. Would be keen to hear your thoughts on selecting colors. I've always found your colors to look "right" but I'm can't even explain why it looks right to me compared to another drawing.</br>  Just watched first episode.<br><br>The "twist" fell flat for me considering I figured it out after the first minute. Is this going to be Madoka 2.0 or does it retain the lighthearted elements?</br></br>  <br>Explain how you found out in the first minute. Of course I assume you don't mean literally but what tipped you off.<br><br> does it retain the lighthearted elements <br>Yes up until I certain incident.</br></br></br></br>  <br>inb4 he read the manga</br>  <br> Madoka 2.0 <br><br>Just stop.</br></br></br>  <br>So Yuki waking up inside the school and getting dressed was enough for you to go "Yep, zombie apocalypse"?</br>  <br> finding out after the first minute <br>Oh well, if you watched it so late after all people on fucking /a/ were saying "HOLY SHIT THAT PLOT TWIST IN FIRST EP" everywhere in OPs, after details and images were spread en masse in dozens of threads, no wonder you got the idea. You trying to look so clever and condescending towards any kind of thematical subversion/scenaristic tool is ultimately a failure.</br></br>  <br> finding out after the first minute </br>  <br>I know you're manufacturing these "So I just watched GG and..." to make it seem like we're discussing something and this isn't a general, but you don't need to try so hard.</br>  I feel like we've already had this thread before. Hm.  <br>Trying to get my friend into it almost failed because the fucking synopsis almost spoiled it while we were downloading it. Sure he found out so early because he expected something as soon as I tabbed out of the synopsis. <br><br>Who fucking does that. He ended up finding out about it at the hard-tack scene (for the most part).</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's the deconstruction of Madoka's Evangelion.</br>  Did you figure out Megu-nee was already dead in the first minute?   Madoka 2.0 <br>Nice bait thread to keep the general going friend. Sage for obvious reasons</br>  <br>What the fuck anon WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT HOW TERRIFYING</br>  <br>Sadly, we can't blame the broadcasters for doing this, they have obligations to uphold and giving a short guess of what to expect in an anime is one of those. Lying or tricking someone into watching something whereas it ends up being something else could actually be taken into court, if I'm not mistaken.</br>  <br> Just watched first episode. <br><br>Just right after the last thread died? What a coincidence.</br></br></br>  <br>Granted, first minute was hyperbole. But by halfway the episode there's been the hints of the renamed rooms, the peculiar animation differences of the nonexistant characters, and Miki completely disregarding them.<br><br>The only thing in advance I knew was that there was gonna be a plot twist of some sort. And honestly it didn't feel very subtle to me.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you know? dressing girls is a symbol of zombie apocalypse in anime.</br>  <br>I just got here, there was no thread up so I made one. Bite me.</br>  <br>Well, you got the idea at least. It was supposed to give you hints before the reveal. I also knew something would happen at the end, the difference is that the anime actually bored me so I jumped half of the episode, and the plot twist hit me damn hard anyway. Expecting a plot twist is something, expecting the nature of said twist is an entirely different thing</br>  <br>If you knew there was going to be a twist then of course you were looking out for it. But things like animating background characters differently is incredibly common in anime, and for all you knew they were still setting up Miki as that sort of character. I read the manga ages ago so of course I knew, but I think they pulled it off decently enough to trick anyone going in blind. It dragged out a little long though.</br>  <br>That's not quite the first minute. Yeah, there are tons and tons of hints, some obvious and some not, they obviously wanted you to know there was something going on.<br><br>If it was just out of nowhere without any possibility of figuring anything out beforehand then it would be dumb and cheap.</br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean even things like Yuyushiki were in the middle of a zombie apocalypse?</br>  <br> common in anime <br>Yeah, so much stuff can be overlooked because of that.<br>Why are they living in the school? Moe anime.<br>Why is there a dog running around in school? Moe anime.<br>Why is Miki so socially retarded? Moe anime.<br>Why aren't there teachers stopping them? Moe anime.<br>Why do background characters keep disappearing? Moe anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Shamelessly requesting the Yuyushiki puppet theory.</br>  Reminder that Miki is involved in ALL Gakkou Gurashi ships  <br>For me the overly cutesy character even for a SoL made me suspicious and then the talking to people that no one else sees made it obvious.</br>  <br>Not in my personal ship.</br>    Kangaroo isn't real, is she?  <br> Rii is the only one without one <br><br> The bear doesn't count. </br></br></br>  Let's liven up the thread.  Is the Miki guy real or just an illusion?  <br>Miki is real.  The dick is an illusion. </br>      <br>How could you think Miki is an illusion?</br>  <br>Miki a real  slut. </br>  <br>Rii/Kurumi</br>  RII A  PUTA   <br>Too perfect to be real, for example you can realise Shovel is real because she is a slut.</br>  <br>Literally when?</br>  <br>Miki is not a slut. Miki is not a slut!</br>  <br>It's way too obvious to be a tweest, I bet she's actually real.</br>  <br>Has this chapter already been translated?</br>  <br>Having a stable love interest is not being a slut.</br>  <br>I ship Yuuri X Yuki.</br>  <br> red knees <br>slut</br></br>  I want to help Hika with her cravings.  <br>I'd like to tickle her thighs in private.</br>  Why is it so hard for Japan to just make a serious anime without any stupid little girl bullshit?  <br>Literally begging for semen.</br>  Is chapter 38 already translated?<br>It came out last week IIRC.</br>  <br>The twist isn't the point of this series. It doesn't even last the entire series. People hyping it up for the twist are big dummies.</br>  <br>Because children and pedophiles comprise the vast majority of the audience.</br>  <br>This. Makes me realize that she was a zombie since the beginning and she bite sempai.</br>  <br/>    <br><br>Maybe she has knee bursitis. Don't bully the shovel.</br></br>  <br>Yuki got the first panty shot.</br>  <br>Yep.<br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336</br></br>  <br> Bullying Miki <br>Why is Shovel so shit?</br></br>  <br> mess around with drunken college guys <br>What? That entire scene was to show that she DOESN'T do that</br></br>  <br>Never.  I was poorly attempting to make a joke with the picture. </br>  <br>The biggest question is, who got Rii-san pregnant?</br>  <br>I want to see Yuki breaking for real. Not just being depressed, melancholic, or her mind gradually snapping back into sanity in a cathartic rush, but trembling in sheer terror with nobody near to offer comfort.</br>  <br>You mean like this?</br>  <br> but trembling in sheer terror with nobody near to  <br>offer comfort.<br><br>That happened at least twice.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The "twist" fell flat for me considering I figured it out after the first minute. <br>ooooooh look at this edgelord here. a lying edgelord too. go back to MAL, and stop trying so hard to fit in.</br></br>  <br>The dog.</br>  <br> Korean <br>Ok, well played, anon, well played.<br> it's kinda annoying that 36 and 37 and + are not posted anywhere I could find it, since watching every thread is impossible. I can wait </br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck her, but not in a puddle of broken glass. That shit is to heavy for me, sry.</br>  <br>Because this is not the 90s anymore. The average modern anime fan feels uneasy without pink-haired bug-eyed girls.</br>  <br>That didn't bring her anywhere near the breaking point.<br><br>When? Everybody ran to her when she offed that zombie and started crying, and in the flashback Megu-nee was the one to comfort her. That's nowhere near being alone and abandoned.</br></br></br>    <br>She was pregnant before the thing happened.</br>  <br> distortion + moustache <br>It's evolving</br></br>  <br>That has happened twice, albeit briefly</br>  <br>Honestly, GG would lose all of it's charme and things that make it feel different if they didn't use typical Moe MCs.<br>Here it's a bad complaint.</br></br>  WHERE ARE MY SUBS [kdfss] YOU FUCKS  <br><br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/6asgq<wbr>jUM/file.html<br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/gerMN<wbr>YWC/file.html<br><br>36 and 37</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Would Miki have lost if the School Living club didn't find her?  <br>Yes probably.</br>  <br><br> Yes </br></br>  <br>No, the school living club would have lost if Miki didn't find them.</br>  <br> WAS ME </br>  <br><br>Gakkou Gurashi is actually an argument against moe.<br><br>The zombie apocalypse represents the worthless NEET fans that are destroying anime.<br>Before the zombie apocalypse, Yuki (who represents moe) was liked by noone, a depressed bullied outsider for her odd quirky behavior.<br>After the zombie apocalypse, Yuki is beloved by all for her odd quirky behavior.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please stop, I literally just came back from school where someone was trying to explain why don't blink was an amazing movie by making crackpot allegory connections.

I can't fap to this.</br>   watch anime with plot twist weeks after it comes out <br> I noticed in the first minute <br>No shit. That's what happens when spoilers are everywhere.  TL of c38 when? </br></br>  <br><br>Does it count as high quality if I didn't notice it was an edit until it was pointed out? It's a damn good edit.</br></br>   no scans of Miki yet <br><br>Fucking why?</br></br>  <br>Any more of this anon?</br>    <br>It's very convincing. They even made rii's breasts bigger</br>   Did I make it in time?   <br>That would probably be because it's actually the artist editing his own stuff.</br>  <br>So do they explain why the cat hat girl has different uniform than the other 3 girls?</br>  <br>Symbolism.</br>  <br>It's in negative.

Different uniforms for different divisions maybe.</br>  <br>They'd have to be to insult such a kind, pure, gentle, and cute girl. Only monsters would do such things.  Like zombies. </br>  <br>At least lower the resolution so it doesn't look like complete ass.</br>  I don't watch this anime but I know ou the shovel girl is the sluttiest of the cast.  <br>The memes actually, we have some pretty funny over here, I personally like the mexicans.</br>  <br>Nice try Mikifag.</br>  <br>All the Gurashis are pure love.</br>  <br>you mean pure sex</br>  <br>Except  Yuuri . She's pure  shit </br>  I'm pretty sure the gakkou gurashi general can agree that Yuuri is worst girl.  <br>not even close</br>  <br>Fuck you, Yuki is best girl.</br>  <br>Only secondaries hate Yuki.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she's a sexual predator as well.<br> Yuki starts regaining her sanity and independence <br> Rii suddenly finds a new girl to play big sister to </br></br></br>  <br><br>Glasses-chan=Yuki&gt;Shovel&gt;Miki&gt;Kei&gt;M<wbr>egu-nee&gt;Helicopter-kun&gt;Crossbow-kun<wbr>&gt;Radio-chan&gt;Bear&gt;Dog&gt;shit&gt;Rii</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>that bitch with the brown hair is the worst girl<br>she's more delusional than Yuki PLUS she's a not-cute-at-all cunt who brakes the rules. <br>also she lacks prescene: only one I can't remember the name of.</br></br></br>  <br>Was Yuuri the one who got bite and return to the club endangering them?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128635559 <br>BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</br>  <br>Walnut = Cathat &gt; Radio-chan &gt; Miki &gt; Megu-nee &gt; bear girl &gt; College sluts &gt; Rii</br>    <br>No, that's Kurumi and that certified her as the best because she immediately told them what happened instead of trying to keep it secret.</br>  <br>why?</br>  So what the fuck is that pink slut's problem?

I'm more concerned about the way it spreads. You essentially just get infected if a mammal bites you right? Wouldn't that automatically mean that apart from Japan, the world is okay? And wouldn't the world have bombed the shit out of Japan (again) by this time?

Translator does like one a day. One of the best translators out there, IMHO. Delivers constantly and awesomely.<br><br>So, now Death March has its own manga coming out!

Also gorgeous. And not much of a loli... but clearly young, cute, and inexperienced. HA!</br>  <br>To be fair,  that is rather the point of the novel. He was maliciously summoned to the world with these skills he was working on before he came for one reason: To kill the Dragon God.<br><br>And when he uses Meteor Shower and annihilates the area, he does.<br><br>This world is a trap by evil, malicious gods. They summon people from other worlds and other japans. The Dragon God was their greatest rival, and he was the one who kept destroying the demon lords they kept raising up, him and his children.<br><br>They end up summoning these people to turn them into demon lords and monsters to torment the world and entertain them. And Satou has to fight that.<br><br>But it starts out with him just wanting to tour the world, sightsee, and he rights wrongs and fixes problems as he goes along. Including collecting a small group of slaves who all are in love with him but he has no interest in them.<br><br>Including Arisa, who was a MILF who liked shota boys just like Satou in her japan, but when summoned was put in the body of a girl. So she is rather miffed that Satou won't let her do things to his body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Yes, its wish fulfillment. Yes, its yet another bit of mmo insertion mechanics. But its a great story!</br></br></br>  <br> Including Arisa, who was a MILF who liked shota boys just like Satou in her japan, but when summoned was put in the body of a girl.

I was waiting for this to get a manga adaption.  <br>Same here. The light novel is fucking fantastic. I am really thankful for the translator being so boss and working alone and getting one out per day. The Word Master stuff fell apart when a group started to do things.<br><br>Stupid Loliquent.</br></br></br>  Is it following the LN like Shield Hero and has therefore changes?  <br> The light novel is fucking fantastic. <br>I've heard this way too many times. Now I don't believe any light novel reader.</br></br>  <br>People seem to like the MC of this, totally incomprehensible over here.<br>He names his companions like pets, is so fucking passive that it hurts at points, and plays the secret hero of justice.<br><br>I couldn't continue anymore after he "beat" that dude who kidnapped the elf.<br><br>And obviously, you won't be reading the LN but the WN if you can't moon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If we group the girls by maturity and the most complete girl for Darling, the list should be something like this (?) <br><br>1) Rachnee<br>2) Cerea<br>3) Miia-Mero<br>4) Papi-Suu<br><br>As always the playlist.<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>For the casual faggots or the people who doesn't read the last chapter of the manga go to prettyanonymus and download the chapter</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why live?</br>  <br>Fuck off with your SJW shit, retard.</br>  <br>to this day i have not found the answer</br>  <br><br> racist <br><br>They're less racist and more just immature.</br></br></br></br>  When is someone going to make Suu's flower bloom like she did to the other girls?  In this thread we wish Sasha a happy birthday. Once again she's lived to see another one. Good job and keep up the good work. <br><br>As far as discussion goes what do you think Annie was planning to do after she failed to capture Eren? He was clearly going to the capital to be executed. Was she going to try her luck again and escape with him? In that case Erwin probably avoided a lot of unnecessary deaths of civilians. <br><br>Another thing, when BRY left they were saying that really soon it's going to be hell inside of the walls. What does that mean? All I can think of is that the wall titans are going to wake up and let all of the outside titans in, killing everyone. The reason they wanted Historia was because she (has the potential to) knows the secret of the walls. Is there a way to stop them from waking up? Keeping them in the dark seems to be working.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Advisor maybe?

Nobody is saying otherwise.<br><br>We're saying that despite being a greedy and thieving bastard, he still actually saves peoples lives and cares for a very specific set of people, and that he's still alive. Disprove all of these facts with actual events in Monogatari, no head canon.  You can't </br></br></br></br>  <br>1. there hasn't been much since snail left. what? koi, hana, and tsuki? koi was awesome anyways, hana was a pretty neat story that focused on SOMEONE ELSE, and tsuki would've been shitty with or without snail<br><br>also, snail comes back in owari</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ononoki was told by Gaen, who knows everything, that Kaiki stole from Hitagi and didn't help her with the crab because he was helping cut the mom out of the family.<br><br>Ononoki isn't an unreliable narrator.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The story is told and narrated by him, that includes that the doll is there. No way gaen can know everything in the first place.<br><br><br><br>Then im glad you admit you were wrong, and that what we are saying here is that a greedy and thieving conman and liar cant be trusted. He does not save people nor cares for other people and only wants money to benifit himself.
