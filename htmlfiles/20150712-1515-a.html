[ Ranma/Takahashi thread! All Takahashis welcome.    <br>Is she even still alive?</br>  <br>Ayep</br>    I never really liked the Ranma anime, didnt really capture the energy of the manga. Plus they changed a bunch of shit. The movies were lackluster especially the first one. The OVAs didnt even cover some of the better battle arcs like the Herb and Ryu Kumon arcs. Almost makes me wonder if thats what started DEEN's record of shoddy adaptations.    Ranma is best girl and best boy    <br>That is a fact.</br>   Thai kicku   What do you guys think of rin-ne,  <br>The op is pretty awesome</br>  Urusei Yatsura was so popular, it used to get its own fan magazine.  <br>And the first fucking image on the fan art is Lum's ass.</br>  <br>watching Tanaka grovel in No Laugh Prison before getting thai kicked wasn't fun at all, it was sad.</br>    This thread is daijoubu.  Since there's no other thread I'll give you a bump, but I'm too lazy to actually post shit.    Stop making threads faggot.    Ep 2 doesn't air for like four days. Just leave this be.  There's not a lot to talk about for another month  This thread<br><br> I like this series <br> I hate this series <br> stop hating what I like <br> stop liking what I hate <br> My opinion is the law <br> Nicknames <br> Miki is best boy <br> "It's okay" meme <br> I was only pretending to have PTSD <br> FUCK OFF BACK TO *Another 4chan like site* <br><br>did I get everything?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Miki a boy?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>if it's a green text, it must be true</br>  <br>It's daijoubu. But if it dies, so be it. The natural course of life.<br><br>This page feels relevant for everything.</br></br></br>  <br>Just leave the threads be until there is an actual reason to talk about them - new ep, new chapter etc.</br>  <br>Listen nerd, I just watched the episode and I want to talk about things you've all already talked about 6 gorillon times.</br>  <br>Let's talk about the spooky ending.</br>  <br> It's daijoubu <br>I knew that, but seeing "diejoubu" honestly made me think I had been misspelling it for the longet time</br></br>  Is anyone else bothered by the characters' eyes? I can't help but focus on the beady little dot that's in the center   36 and 37 out <br> translations never ever </br>   So nobody actually thinks Yuki's delusional anymore, right?<br>It's pretty clear she sees the world as it really is now, and is playing along with the others asking her to ask the teacher, among other things.<br>My guess is her reason is either that she thinks THEY'RE delusional, or she's just trying to keep them thinking she still is to keep their spirits up.</br></br>   <br>I'm pretty sure they all know it's an act now and play along to keep their sanity as they did before.</br>  <br>It's to make their expressions more intense for the viewer.<br><br><br>She wants to keep being the happy spring of hope that they can cling to, even after school.  Also, it's because Rii-san's fucking lost it. </br></br></br></br>  Animeonly fags not allowed.  <br>Rii san is daijobu now that Ruu chan is with her.</br>  <br>Are you trying to tell me  the imouto isn't real?<br>I hadn't even considered that</br> <br><br> Also, wondering if Kurumi's going to go the same way the guy in Z Nation did<br>That could definitely be interesting</br> </br></br></br>  <br> I considered that but I doubt it, considering chpater 36 and 37 she seems pretty real. </br>  <br>pls no, let me in your secret club, I almost finished downloading the mango</br>  I'm sure someone has noticed this before, but<br>They smile, she smiles back and then... pic related</br>  <br>Too late faggot.</br>  <br><br> Just read the chapters and she's a delusion.<br>Rii-san lost it. She almost got shot because of it too.</br> </br></br>  <br>I don't like how Rii's sister stares at my soul.</br>  <br>Where can I look at 36 and 37?<br>I haven't been able to find them</br></br>  No matter what, constant pointless threads are a mistake. Look at the Yucky Tuna fags.  <br>"Anime was a mistake" -- Anonymous</br>  <br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336<br>korean only</br></br>  <br>What kind of flowers are those anyway?<br><br> I swear to god if those are funeral flowers, I'm going to kill an anon. </br></br></br>  <br>Much appreciated<br> Yeah, she's definitely a delusion </br></br>  <br> funeral flowers <br>is that a thing?</br></br>  why so many threads of the mango lately? is it because of the animated series?  if so why everyone talks about the manga now?   <br>At least they are not growing fucking higanbana.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> Anime airs. <br> People talk about the anime and start asking questions that are answered in the manga. <br> Someone talks about the manga or tells others to read it. <br> It eventually becomes a manga thread. <br>Something like this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this<br>I started reading because of the anime, didn't even know about it before, and I love it</br></br>  <br>This. I started reading it because of the anime.<br><br>Though, it was on my backlog, and the only thing I remembered from the thread that got me interested in it before is that I heard that the MC was fucking insane and that she was surviving in some sort of apocalypse. I think I also heard that all her friends were dead and that she was imagining everyone else, with her being all by herself, but I may have read that post wrong, two years ago.</br></br></br>  <br> If you notice she fades when the university girl shakes hands with Rii-san.<br><br>Maybe Rii-san will be okay after all.</br></br> </br>  these threads are even worse than the oregairu threads  <br>That's impossible.</br>  <br><br>I've been to the oregairu threads. I strongly disagree.</br></br>  <br>Come on now.</br>  What do you think the chances are for this to get a figma?  <br>I don't know but I'll have to become a buyfag.</br>  <br>I want a Rii-san or a Mi-kun one.<br><br>Pretty low chances though, but I hope the anime does well, I liked the direction of the first episode, and I hope they end the run with the graduation.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop this. There doesn't need to be a general up at all times.</br>  I wish Vivid used different words for "Yuki-chan" and "senpai" instead of using "Yuki" for both. Makes it a pain to edit the subs since I can't just find and replace.  <br>This, if they're decent looking at least. I don't think I'd resist a Kurumi with a shovel accessory or a hatless Yuki with a winged backpack and baseball bat.</br>  <br>figma? I don't know, a Nendoroid would be the most likely thing, and even then it'd probably be just Yuki. I'd prefer a Kurumi 100x more, but GSC will generally not do more than one char from a show unless it got very very popular in Japan, which I don't see as likely here.</br>  <br>I'd rather have a static figure.<br><br> Of the shovel. </br></br></br>   Is shovel going to have increasingly harder to control urges involving eating her friends, ending in her letting one of them get killed by the zombies, dragging her body off and eating it?<br> Because I would be very, very OK with that </br>   <br>You can always get a 1:1 static shovel in no time.</br>  <br>But it won't be Kurumi's shovel.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127948221 <br><br>Read the manga, it's great. Who knows how the anime will go?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127948221 <br>Timeline's fucked in the anime anyway, dude</br>  I don't get it. Is Megu-nee already dead at the start of the anime? Because I'm pretty sure she was alive at the beginning of the manga.<br>Is the anime an different timeline? Because if Megu-nee is already dead then they will have to find a way to make Kurumi into a zomie (or drop that plot point entirely).<br>Could it be that it's actually set in the middle of the manga and Kurumi is already a zombie?</br></br>  <br>Nor will you get Kurumi. Ever.</br>  <br>Make one yourself</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127948221 <br> catch up with the manga <br> have to wait more than a month for new chapters <br>You're in hell either way.</br></br></br>  <br>She was dead in both.</br>  <br><br>She was dead at the start of the manga too. The real changes were the addition of Taromaru and Mikki to the opening.</br></br>  <br> I'm pretty sure she was alive at the beginning of the manga. <br>You're wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's why I'm settling for her shovel. If I can't have Kurumi, I want her shovel.<br><br><br>Good idea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he specifically meant she's  ACTUALLY dead in the anime, seemingly </br>  <br><br><br>Then what about the note in her book and the radio announcement?</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127948221 <br>Read the manga, because the anime's changed some stuff (Miki at the beginning,  puppy not dead ), and the mangaka's working on it too so he'd probably do something with the anime to get even mangafags to watch it to the end and entertain them as well by deviating from the source.</br>  <br>Not that much man, aside from Taroumaru, the anime pretty much started after Vol 2, while mixing some events from the first manga chapter.<br><br>As long as we get some proper flashbacks it's a good direction, since they can end with the graduation.</br></br></br>  <br>She started writing the notes before she died and the radio announcement was made by the radio broadcaster.</br>  Which chapter is it that Taromaru dies?  <br>It'll probably do things somewhat differently but not deviate too much from the source still. My guess is it'll be more of an alternate take on events rather than deviate completely.</br>  <br>She died some time after the outbreak but before the beginning of the manga. Does this needs to be explained every thread?</br>  <br>The one he is introduced in.</br>  <br>Flashback in chapter 17.</br>  <br>It was a flashback, chapter 17</br>  <br>Probably, but I wouldn't discard an original ending because S2 never.</br>  <br> the radio broadcaster <br>Who? It was the internal school system, you know.</br></br>  <br>An ending needs a climax, which the manga clearly lacks.</br>  Is the chapter translation up 036? That's as far as I've read.  Just read up to current. Can someone explain to me why everyone says Miki has deathflags?  <br>She is the most sane one.</br>  <br> anime ends with Yuki and co. getting into the car and leaving for university </br>  <br>My point precisely? They might decide to go with something more ending-like than the graduation.</br>  <br> anime is just a collection of flashbacks intertwined with CGDCT shenanigans <br> final episode is graduation <br>We're going to end up suffering</br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather see it end on a cliffhanger. That way, if it sells well they can make a S2, otherwise, people will hopefully be hooked enough to read the manga. I've been reading the manga since last year, so it's no big deal for me either way.</br>  <br>I'm guessing you are talking about this, which is either the radio broadcaster or the scientists contacting them.</br>  <br>Nigga, I've said it two times in the thread, ending it in the graduation would be perfect. It's meaningful, they get a few answers and they could end it with them riding to potential safety as an open end. Having them sing their graduation song could be emotional as fuck.<br><br>It could even lead into a S2 if they wanted it too.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the part where Megu-nee "sacrifices" herself to distract the zombies and save the girls.</br>  <br>Could be a big deal if the sales don't go well and it gets cancelled.<br><br>I doubt it though, but it could certainly happen.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a flashback, baka, she's been z-or-dead the whole manga</br>  <br><br>that covers 99% of /a/ threads so nobody should post anything anymore<br> forgetting your waifu is shit </br></br></br>  <br>You mean saves Kurumi while Yuki is in the bathroom? That was Rii.</br>  <br> That's a flashback <br>I don't remember it being. Do you know which chapter it is, so I can clear my confusion?</br></br>  <br>What's with this ugly chromatic aberration?<br>Why is this a thing?</br></br>  <br>Ah. That's true. It's a happy and open ending with them leaving the school towards hope.<br><br> If only they knew... </br></br></br>  <br>As long as the manga gets more readers it doesn't really matter how well the anime sells or not, it won't affect the manga.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M1u<wbr>Vi41I1oc</wbr>  [ ]  <br> Chapter 37 ended pretty hopeful with Rii-san's delusions toning down and getting to University. They did introduce human raiders though. </br>  <br>I'm tired of graduation endings though<br>I'd be ok with that this time if we got an S2</br></br>  <br>Chapter 5, you are confused because Yuuri uses the broadcasting room aswell in that chapter to distract the zombies that are attacking Kurumi.</br>  <br>That's the point anon, if the manga doesn't get readers, or worse, loses them because of the anime, it could very well be cancelled.</br>  <br> it gets cancelled. <br>Why would they ever. Etotama ran till the very end and that was the flop of the century.</br></br>  <br>Oh, I see. Thank you very much. Now I can accept the fact that Megu-nee has been dead since the beginning.</br>  <br>Well, if these threads are any indication, it'll get a lot of new readers.<br><br>I mean, we don't matter but if the situation is similar over in Japan then the first episode would have made people interested enough to check out the manga, just like here.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry anons,<br>just get the english version.<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-05-08/yen-press-adds-gakko-g<wbr>urashi-aka-ya-akashi-ya-ayakashi-no<wbr>-manga/.87962</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Well, her 'grave' is visible on page one of chapter 4, so there's that.</br>  <br>To be honest, it was on my backlog for 2 years, literally sitting there on my list. First episode was good engouh to finally check it out and catch up.<br><br>We can only hope it's the same in Japan, but remember their magazines depend on questionnaires and stuff like that.</br></br></br>  how did the helicopter crash destroy everything on the roofs if it only crashed in the courtyard?  <br>NO<br><br>Someone has to stop Yen Press, they've gone too far.</br></br></br>  <br>The fire spread through all the building, it could've reached the roof.<br><br>Even then, smoke would've killed the plants anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> The fire rises. </br>  <br>Never payed attention to official translators,<br>What did they do wrong?</br></br>  <br>I was lucky. It was one of the few manga I gave a read right as I found it. Ended up reading through all 26 then released chapters and loved the fuck out of it.</br>  Wait, where did you read chapter 37?  <br>Is this going to fuck with fan translation efforts at all?</br>  <br>Yen press takes years to release shit, and of course they C&amp;D anyone that works on what they license, even if they're 20 volumes ahead.<br><br>And of course, they only end up licensing shit that already has people working on it, so they can just reuse the already translated script and make money of already existing fan base.</br></br></br>  What do you guys think is the reason for the apocalypse?  <br>Moe.</br>  <br>Read the thread<br><br><br><br>I was so happy to be able to get the books in english. ;_;7</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>broken nutbladder syndrome</br>  <br>Experimentation from the labs.<br>They've hinted a lot to this from all the shelters, the safety protocols and the city being funded by a mysterious pharmaceutical corporation.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not as bad with manga as it is with light novels though.

At least she went back to school. </br>  <br>Oh fuck, this just blew my mind.</br>  <br>No good things for her.</br>  <br> It's pretty obviously the latter, although she's effectively making the same mistake as Megu-nee made by encouraging Rii's delusions now. </br>  <br>I think she's still partly in her delusions. She's just a lot less reliant on them. She still believes them because she wants to believe them, but she misses a lot more details and sometimes she forgets she should be delusional in the first place until somebody else points it out.<br><br>Watching Rii fall apart is probably gonna snap her out of it completely.</br></br></br>  <br>You've been rused anon.</br>  <br><br>This show's gonna turn real dark real fast, huh?</br></br>  <br> Implying it hasn't already </br>  <br>Get out</br>  Post little girls suffering  <br>People keep suggesting the medicine was for him, but isn't it obvious to bring 3 shots when the card only showed 3 girls?

Gives off an Umbrella corp vibes.<br><br>Dunno. Could be something like that in 28 Days Later.</br></br></br></br>  Whatafuck man why did the dude in the helicopter suddenly turn undead?  <br><br>Given the blood stains and the violence in the classroom, it can be inferred that zombies were there. Where are they now? <br><br>While it is possible some could have been lured away, most of them in the safe area were probably taken care of by shovel-chan. Which means she's got quite a kill count already.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, she could just be a carrier now. She won't turn fully undead, but she can still potentially infect others.</br></br>  <br>He was close to rescuing them, so plot magic killed him.</br>  <br>He was bitten and took the serum, but it wore off. The same happened with the radio broadcaster.</br>  <br>They were dealt with, remember in the early chapters that guy that shovel liked?</br>  <br>Zombies were still crawling all over the school building as shown in the manga.</br>  <br>Lets not post speculation as fact.</br>  <br>Isn't he still a z, as far as they know?<br>At least that's what shovel's comment about "one of them running the track" meant to me</br></br>  <br><br>An anon told me that it was implied that the infected were also semi-conscious. That's getting pretty fucking horrifying for a series with broken moe girls.</br></br>  hold up i never even finished the first episode cause it was so boring does this show get bloody or ppl just b8ing on this thread  <br>It's just people b8ing. <br>Don't bother, it's just moeshit.</br></br>  <br> ppl <br>How about you find out yourself, retard</br></br>  <br>the zombies still remember things really important to them, which is why garters friend came back to the school or  Megu-nee went to the shelter </br>  <br>Yes, it's kinda like the setting at 28 Days and 28 Weeks Later. People are still "alive", only that the virus addled their minds. As that opening scene at 28 Days Later when an infected priest was hesitating to maul the protagonist, implying they still have some sense remaining in them. They still keep their human sense but their whole body is totally under the influence by the virus or whatever that infected them.</br>  <br>but that would require a whole 5 seconds of google anon u think im made of time?</br>  <br>he was on the roof when he turned</br>  <br><br>Especially when   you see megu-nee's thoughts after turning into a zombie  </br></br>  <br>I can see you're not only lacking of time, but also a brain.</br>  <br>I thought that was just a nightmare<br><br>What was her comment about, in that case?<br>Just her nostalgia-ing about running herself?</br></br></br></br>   Manga Time Kirara <br><br>Oh god, this isn't gonna become dykeshit isn't it?

Especially due to the last episode's title.<br>Real answer: There's an established harem in a school, but the MC views the girls as something to protect and guide more than anything, essentially like a shepherd and his sheep. These girls show slight abnormalities but nothing too extreme. The plot really gets going once the Bro character enters the fold, as the dude wants to help guide the poor little sheep too. He becomes the MC's sheepdog. Girls hate the new dynamic and their 'quirks' become larger for a time but the Bro calms things down. Then, something happens to make a Kouhai of MC's become 'lost'. The MC finds her and looks for an answer to her problem, finds it and sends her on her way. Bro's help is essential in this process, and the girls get jealous of the Bro's closeness to the MC. This causes chaos in the harem and the girls start throwing a fit. They eventually turn this anger on to the MC, but find that the Bro character fends them off at all costs, including his reputation. This drives them mad and their individual psychoses start flaring into the foreground. They reveal their status as 'Wolves' and start viciously attacking Bro in all kinds of ways. MC finally has enough of it, reveals he's gay, and calls the police on the bitches, finally seeing that they are irredeemable in their natures. He then decides that it's not his job to help people out like that, so he and the Bro start hanging out and eventually, at the end of the last episode, actually call what they're doing a date.</br></br>  1.

She gets assigned to the EVA side of the operation and very quickly butts heads with the experienced bloke she's been paired up with.<br> 3. Team-Building Exercise <br>They get cycled off active duty for some familiarization and training, it doesn't go so well, with the new girl trying her hardest but ultimately failing to perform.<br> 4.

Numbers/Confessions <br>Male lead (ML) spends most of the episode trying to get his version of the girl's (G) number, while female lead (FL) does her best to make it clear to her version of the boy (B) that she's interested. <br>Episode ends with ML confessing to FL under the belief that she is G, and FL accepting under the belief that he is B.<br> 2. Confusion/Revelations <br>The next day, ML approaches G but is confused when she doesn't know what he's talking about, and FL is confused when B doesn't approach her at all. <br>ML discovers that it's the wrong number and calls it again, and the leads begin to realise the truth.<br> 3. Separation/Plans <br>Continuing from the last episode, ML and FL attempt to confirm the situation, and realise that it's true. <br>Both are initially frustrated, before FL decides that this is still an opportunity for her to get closer to B and convinces ML to go along with it.<br> 4. Secrets/Hesitance <br>Despite agreeing to the plan, both of the leads are quite reluctant to part with their deepest secrets and ML points out FL that the information might be inaccurate given that they're in different dimensions, <br>However, they decide to go through with it anyway, since it's a once in a lifetime chance.<br> 5. Birthdays/Apologies <br>A few weeks pass and the girls' birthdays are approaching, FL mentioning in passing that she was actually born late at night. <br>ML has spent most of his time in the lead up preparing a present for G, ignoring FL, but she decides that it's okay for him to be a little selfish since he's trying to find a good present. <br> 6. Build-up/Stagnation <br>FL is ready to confess to B. ML starts to get friend-zoned by G.<br> 7. Rejection <br>FL gets rejected, and gets depressed. She accuses ML of giving her bad information, and they argue. They reconcile by insulting B's sexuality, deciding that it's why he rejected FL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cont.<br> 8. Action/Support <br>FL pushes ML to do more to get closer to G, reasoning that since she's already been shot down, he has to do his best to get together with G. <br> 9. First Date/Jealousy <br>ML and G go on their first date together, and ML begins to realise that he doesn't really like G romantically after all. FL spends the episode worrying, feeling jealous, and feeling guilty at feeling jealous.<br> 10. Falling/Catching <br>ML worries about not liking G anymore, and what it means for his relationship with FL. She declares that no matter what, the two of them are still good friends, and that that was enough.<br> 11. Confessions <br>ML realises that he actually does like FL and works up the nerve to confess. She responds positively to it, since she's fallen for him as well.<br> 12. Distant/Love <br>The two try to come to terms with a super long distance relationship, where they'll never see each other in person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  1.

I could try and dig it out but eh <br>I can imagine. I am an Anna fan, but I can admit I would not hate Kotori as much as I do if she had at least been handled better, like at least on Anzu's level.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a fucking disappointment Anna turned out to be (I mean in terms of screentime).<br><br>Seriously, the only Kaz designed character in the show and she's in a grand total of eight episodes</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, saved. Nice style, anon, I think I've seen your art before.</br>  <br>Why do you torture me so</br>  <br>Kaz did Yuma, Shark, and Kaito as well. I think he might have done Tetsuo as well, but Kaz's role for him was just a bully with Tokunosuke as his underling.</br>  <br>I doubt it, nah he didn't</br>  <br>Eh. Sex isn't that sexy.</br>  <br>Add in that there is a possibility that Number 81 is a potential "artifact" from a plan that had Anna more relevant.</br>   they get into the friendship cup <br> Sawatari only thinks about how they'll dazzle everyone with their entertainment duel <br> Yuuya so far in the hole he can only think about how annoying the tournament is and how he needs to get back to finding Yuzu <br><br>Yuuya is a broken record</br></br></br></br>  <br>KOIBA</br>  <br> disappointment <br>not to my dick she isn't</br></br>  <br>All he needs to do is summon his Rebellion series to rip up the stupid stadium that's hosting the tournament.</br>  <br>Ah yeah, I remember hearing about that.

God I hate that archetype.</br>  <br>I was looking at nico comments earlier, and I didn't notice before that no one bothered to ask Yuya if he was even up for dueling the kingu.

Fubuki is the one who ran Red-Eyes as an archetype.</br>  <br/>  <br>You know that people will want you to draw Ruris from now on right?</br>  <br>He did, but most people will immediately associate Red-Eyes with Jonouchi over Fubuki</br>  <br>Wasn't Red-Eyes used by Darkness more than Fubuki?</br>   there are people in this thread RIGHT NOW that think Yuuya and Yuzu don't deserve to be together   <br>Serena is one of my favorite characters to draw so that's fine by me.</br>  <br>Well, Darkness Fubuki is still Fubuki.

Apparently there's a whole wiki page for Zexal/Kuwahara bashing, including a whole page dedicated to his stand-out quotes. Translating an excerpt.<br><br>"twitterでは遊戯王OCGについては全くと言っていいほど話題に出<wbr>さず、「ノーマルのマシュマック を持っている」とOCGについて間違った発言するなど、知識はほとんど無い<wbr>様子。このOCGへの無知・無関心がゼアル本編でのデュエルの質の低さ、デ<wbr>ュエル・カードの扱いの酷さに繋がっているのではと言われている。"<br><br>"(Kuwahara) has shown that he doesn't really understand the Yu-Gi-Oh OCG on Twitter by saying incorrect things like 'I have a Normal version of (Number 33) Machu Mech'. Some people say that this ignorance of the OCG has spilled into ZEXAL itself with its low-quality duels, and awful treatment of duels and cards."<br><br> LOL </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Out of 146. Out of 146 episodes she was in 11 of them. Fuya even less. Both were interesting characters and could have contributed alot to the plot. The Numbers Club could bphave been a tad more useful as they are in the manga with Cat-chan using her wealth to help find Numbers users. Not to mention she is a comptent duelist and a ninja cat-girl.</br>  <br> @demonatemu: KAIBA is the main focus and made a new duel disk looks like d gazer google glass #yugiohsdcc <br> KAIBA is the main focus <br>MAD<br>HYPE<br><br> tfw I could have had a Yuzu had I not been forced away from my childhood partner  <br>Still depressed, thanks dad</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fubuki ran Red-Eyes way before Darkness came into the picture and infected the deck.</br>  <br>Draw Serena and Yuzu about to tag duel Yuri,then.</br>  <br>Probably did. Since he didn't care about the card game, Hikokubo got to Hikokubo harder than ever.</br>  <br>Nips still enjoyed Zexal regardless though despite the director and headwriter being that bad.<br><br>Ebina at least seems to have good taste in waifus if he's really that disappointed with Kotori.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuma and the previous main characters performing together? The previous mains has such a strong presence, I want to train Yuma well so he won't lose against them. <br><br>Well that didn't work well</br></br></br>  <br>Like I said here,  I think that Number 81 was originally planned to appear but was cut. I just get the feeling that the staff wanted to do more with Anna and had plans for her but were just never allowed to do it.</br>  <br>Because nips like little school girls in skirts and other moe shits. They are like little kids, going kawaii desu~ to anything shiny or sexual on the screen. To them, ZEXAL was paradise.</br>  <br> VECTOR <br>when arc-v best boy is a countdown to psychotic break faces?</br></br>  <br>Serena too cute.</br>  <br>Makes me wonder how Arc-V is doing there. They barely have any shiny or sexual things in that show. Moe, maybe. But it doesn't exactly feel that much moe either.</br>  I encourage anyone who hasn't watched the ARC-V dub to check it out. It's impressively bad. For ZEXAL, the main question was "Why does Yuma sound like that?". For ARC-V, it's "Why does everyone sound like that?"  <br>I bet this scene was popular.</br>  <br>Actually it did, Yuma's Utopia monsters can completely destroy anything Yugi,Jaden using an Elemental Masked deck, Yusei and Yuya using an Odd Eyes Magician deck can throw at him. His Utopias are just that damn broken.</br>  Damn I didn't even notice Arcana Force appeared in Arc-V  <br><br>I'm at ep 10. Do Yuya and any of the alternate Yuzus have any meaningful interactions?</br></br>  <br>Arc-V is pretty damn great when you re-watch it, you notice all that little things you missed out.</br>    <br>Not really.</br>  <br>You're right about most, but not Yuya. Yuya has the best deck of any protagonist.</br>  <br>Joey, what's sex?</br>  <br>Only Yuya and Yuzu.</br>  <br> maybe tomorrow after work </br>  <br>True, but he has no answers to NumberS0 Hope Zexal. Non of the protagonists do.</br>  Rate all the Yugioh shows from best to worst.<br><br>Original &gt; Arc-V &gt; 5D's &gt; GX &gt; Zexal</br></br>  <br>Wow, 11 episodes. That is just so much more. (three of those episodes she is just spectating)</br>  <br>Alternate Yuzus don't really give much of a damn for the Tomato.<br><br>I do get a feeling that the Alternate Yuzus all want a piece of the Citrus themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm glad that Zexal's duels being shit wasn't just me and both sides of the ocean saw it</br>  xth for yuuya  I hate shit like this<br><br>If the card artwork is ready and made to the point where the official site can post images of them anime-formatted (As in, without Kaz's trademark, the pack code, etc.) why don't they fucking release the cards?<br><br>For an avid Chronos fan, I feel flabbergasted at the chance that I may never get to use the Obelisk Force Ancient Gear combos in official duels</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they'll release the cards of the possible Arc-V Chronos.</br>  <br>GX &gt; Arc-V &gt; 5D's &gt; Original &gt; 0 &gt; BBT &gt; Pyramid of Light &gt; ZEXAL</br>    <br>Well, that depends, do we go by anime/manga effects, or game rules?<br><br>Because really, no one has an answer to Horakhty</br></br></br>  <br>Because they have other cards that they want to release.</br>  <br>Original&gt;5D&gt;GXandV&gt;Shitxal</br>  So is this guy the Joey of this series?<br><br>Who is Kaiba? Shun or Reiji?</br></br>  <br>DM = 5D's = Zexal = Arc-V &gt; a steaming pile of shit</br>  <br>Yusei could brute force it with Shooting Star/Shooting Quasar depending on the number os mats he used for Hope Zexal</br>  <br>Arc-V &gt; GX &gt; 5Ds &gt; DM &gt; Zexal</br>  <br>I like Jutte Fighter's girlfriend's feet<br><br>They just look cute, so small and pokeable. Like tiny squishy toys</br></br></br>  <br>Reiji is Kaiba. Shun is more like late part 1/part 2 Kaito, doing his own thing for the most part.</br>  <br>Real game effects and Horakhty doesn't count because it died with Atem,</br>  <br>Well, probably no place to release it yet/space issues. Maybe we'll get the Ancient Gears in an Academia pack that will give us Serena's cards and more Ancient Gears when Academia comes back.<br>Waiting isn't a bad thing, since it means that the cards could turn out better. ANd if Ayu can get her cards printed, then anyone can.</br></br>  <br> all this good taste <br><br>However I'd put BBT before 0</br></br></br>  <br>Funny that, when a few months ago he was pretty bad but still salvagable with pendulum wizard.</br>  ...I can kinda see why people were fed up with Kuwahara now...<br><br>http://www50.atwiki.jp/kizuna1999/p<wbr>ages/22.html<br><br> In response to a question as to why a Stardust Dragon statue wasn't featured in the Duel Lodge episodes <br>"I was asked this before, but since it has to do with the established canon, I can't answer it just yet.

And as a Yuya fan, I love it.</br></br></br>  <br>That was the cool thing about Ono. There was a lot of stuff he mentioned that never had room to be featured in 5D's. Kuwahara seems to just like saying "please watch Zexal" and self-fellate over his own damn characters</br>  <br>I cant remember which staff member it was that confirmed that Yusei using fusion was inspired by see Judai do it as a main strategy in BBT, but I really appreciated it</br>  <br>Yusei had a deck like that once upon a time as well and you see how that got power gapped. By the time the new summoning method arrives Yuya's deck will be fun because it'll be the only one that has Pendulum xyz, synchro and fusion cards.</br>  <br>Not him but ritual in general looks pretty evil. Also it would mean more love being shown to ritual which i support 100%</br>  <br>That was Ono too.</br>  <br>That was Ono.<br><br><br>People like to Yoshida a lot of flak, and I'm not saying he doesn't deserve some of it, but Yoshida still gave us the Dark Signer arc, and with all the behind the scenes issues we now know plagued 5D's, I honestly can't blame him for a lot of its problems.<br>I just feel like Kuwahara is to blame for a good deal of ZEXAL's problems.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hated ever since I found out that not only was Kotori's VA a player of the game, she was a good one and if the staff had a bit more control she would of been a duelist rather than Kuwa's waifu to dress up and tease panty shots with.</br>  You know the show is really good but I have 1 problem with it.<br><br>MC is a manlet. If only he was a bit taller...</br></br>  <br> Ritual <br> Evil <br>That's only because most of the few relevant rituals are used be evil, or their themes like Demise are evil, but not all of them are like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Yusei's deck was a lot of outside cards like Dandylion though. Yuya's is more self sufficient.<br>Plus, Yusei.deks weren't about dropping his boss monster and winning with it like Yuya's is.</br></br>  <br>The official site actually says he's a bit small for his age<br><br>Original designs, he looked a lot taller. Like Judai's height at the beginning of GX</br></br></br>  <br>Don't bully the manlets, it's not their fault.</br>  <br>He's more moe this way.</br>  <br>He's only 14, so he still has time if Destruction/Creation are an indication of anything.</br>  <br>It's so there's cuter interactions between him and Yuzu. Don't worry about it.</br>  <br> Yoshida <br> gave Dark Signers arc <br>I'm pretty sure it was mentioned around here that the Dark Signers arc was from the notes left by the previous headwriter that Yoshida had to follow.<br><br>Meaning, all Yoshida had to do was follow the plan, not create one himself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, as a Ritual fag and a justice/good fag this shock me quite a bit, because it's kinda true, so sometimes I don't know if it is a good idea that pic related may do an appearance in the anime, more if you know that she is supposed to be good but animes can change things with nothing to be ashamed off.<br> I still support the idea like you, though more in the hero side </br></br>  <br>Older Yuya is one sexy motherfucker<br><br>I imagine that will be what he looks like when all the other Yus are absorbed</br></br></br>  What happened to my fingers?  <br>You mean the plan that existed before the cult nonsense started and facilitated the immediate removal of all cult elements?<br>A lot of the Dark Signer arc had to be rewritten while still ongoing. Its a wonder it turned out as good.<br><br>Besides, nothing said that he actually had notes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still funny how the best ritual decks of all times are always about evil stuff, or using stuff of other monsters.</br>  <br>I have an idea.<br> Oreimo <br> Replace both siblings with Shun and a Ruri (your choice), the rest of the girls are the other Ruris <br> Add other things you may want to add <br> Rate it, then choice if it is fixed or still crap </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All the other summoning methods have to do with "combining power" and whatnot, but Rituals are specifically about sacrificing monsters in some sort of ceremony. It's kind of hard to spin that in a good light.</br>    Same source, more Kuwahara antics:<br> replying to someone telling him to stop jerking himself off (for lack of a better term) and talk about the series himself <br>"But I am talking about Zexal."<br><br> replying to someone asking him to keep tweeting <br>"But everyone gets mad at what I tweet about"<br>"Is that all the Zexal love you have everyone?”<br><br> replying to someone telling him "I think you should consider your position as a director, and balance between replies and retweets expressing the fans' love." (I kinda flubbed the translation here, I'm not entirely sure what's being talked about, but the reply itself is as clear as day) <br>"The hell are you talking about? If you don't like at it, don't look at it?<br><br>not trying to fire off another Zexal circlejerk here (I liked the series just fine in its latter half), but it's interesting to see the comments the director makes either way, lol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about when a cute loli performs it?</br>  <br>Wait, you talking about Demise OTK or Nekroz? Because there aren't that many succesfull ritual decks. Also not every rituals are evil. There are things like Cu Chulain, Doriado, Northwemko herself that don't seem evil. Also Rituals represnt the classic "Don't let their sacrifice be in vain". The problem is that many rituals are represented as evil. But they are still for me the one summon that have best designs and effects.</br>  I can't take this fucking HYPE  If Yuya transformed his monsters into Pendulum monsters, what the fuck did Astromancy and Chronomancy do before?  <br>Post more, he is a hack</br>  <br>You forgot Gishki.</br>  <br>The removal of the cult elements started after Dark Signers arc.<br><br>The ones that was obviously rewritten in this arc was Crow's role since he was supposed to be the main villain. Other than that, much of rewritten things in this arc was the end of it since they had to make 5D's a long-running series.<br><br>There's a reason why the first two arcs barely connect to Part 2 of 5D's after all and why the first two arcs felt already too complete with just very minor unsolved mysteries.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-But, Black Magician of Chaos.</br>  <br>Ah yes, Gishki too, damn how could I forgot them?<br><br>Anyway, Rituals for me will be forever the best, specially my favourite monster card here. So I just end with that and continue with<br><br>Just 5 hours right?</br></br></br></br></br>  Is it possible to buy cards with password in TFSP? If so how?  Would a separate /ma/nga board work? Would it be as big of a shithole as /a/ or would it simply lack on content and activity? It's understandable why anime is more popular than manga in general but why even on /a/, a board dedicated to this stuff is the manga content so little compared to the anime.  It would be as dead as /x/  It's better to not fracture the userbase of /a/ any more than it already is. /m/ turned out okay, but we don't want another /jp/.  Keep mango discussion on /a/<br><br>Fragmentation is shit</br></br>    It'd be flooded with battle shounen threads and waifuism.<br><br>same if you were to make a /ar/ board.</br></br>  I would love that, I don't mind if it's slow board. fron time to time there are good manga threads but they die so fast with all the moe posting  <br>I'd still want one though (the /ma/ not the /ar/).</br>  <br>Posts that you feel affection towards?</br>  No, fragmenting a userbase=Killing it.<br>I don't want /jp/ 2.0.</br>  <br>/jp/ isn't dead, they have the idols thread, which are more lively than the 2hous</br>  <br>And you'll be samefag bumping your thread because no one is replying to you on anything that isn't a popular manga because there's nothing worth talking about or no one is reading it.</br>  <br><br>Shounen will get the most threads with battle shounen getting continuous ones while harem/ecchi ones get the most dedicated to it in general<br><br>Shoujo will probably be restricted to generals <br><br>Seinen will be reduced to people complaining about how there are no Seinen threads (unless you are a Berserk fan, then you're fine).<br><br>and Josei will have no threads</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  manga is already niche on /a/ in first place. Few years ago, it was almost non-existant bar few threads here and there<br><br>It may have been growing a bit for past year or two but its still tiny.<br><br>it will be as dead as first poster said</br></br></br></br>   wanting to become like /v/ <br>It would be like the one page threads, only worse with more reposts. Keeping anime and manga in one board also generates more discussion in a thread instead of being limited to just the anime or manga.</br>  <br>Manga threads haven't really changed in quantity.</br>  <br>I'd be alright with this. Mangafags like spoiling things for others. The guys in ONe PIece and JoJO general never ever spoiler tag their Ops. Its due to them that I know that gear 4nd is real.</br>  You should only fragment a board if there are threads that completely take it over, like generals used to on /v/.  Anime and manga are too closely tied for there to be separate boards.  <br>and then people will ask why not make a shounen board. then we'll need a battle shonen board seperate from slice of life romcom school drama board. <br><br>It's not just necessary to make another board because of the minority of the threads.</br></br></br>  <br>Better idea<br><br>just skip the step and make an Action board to contain all the shounen and powerlevel kiddes?</br></br></br>  <br> /m/ turned out okay </br>  <br>Isn't that the point of /v/?</br>  I watched the first episode and liked it, is manga good? Is the romance progressing satisfactorily? I don't want to be addicted to another never-ending nisekoi  The manga has shitty art  Yes, who the winning girl is becomes quite obvious early on.  The romance has been progressing a lot lately. <br><br>The manga is much better than the anime.</br></br>  The voices in the manga are not as good as the anime.  I also really liked the episode. The MC has shitty character design but the heroine more than makes up for it. <br><br>dat Kansai-ben.</br></br>    <br>Yeah, also the animation in the manga is not as good as the anime's.</br>  <br>Yes, I've been following the manga for a while now. I quite enjoy it. I'm happy with the romantic progression. As typical harem it's held up a bit with conflicting love interests, but far from Nisekoi levels of no progress ever. I'd say there's really two love interests that the MC would seriously pursuit here.<br><br><br>Eh, I like the art. It's different, which I find refreshing. Also the facial expressions are consistently great.<br><br><br>  voices in the manga </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And what about the colors?</br></br></br>  What a faithful adaptation. I'm legitimately impressed.  <br><br>JIBUN WOO</br></br>  <br>Two?</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br><br>I think the animation isn't that bad, my only problem with it is the low framerate.</br></br>  <br> Is the romance progressing satisfactorily? <br><br>She did it, she fucking scored.</br></br></br>  <br>and then the other one scored as well<br>and then there were 30+ chapters afterwards<br>and who knows when it's ending<br>very satisfactory indeed, dropped</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's  fun </br>  <br> and then the other one scored as well <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  I just picked this manga up, if  childhood friend  wins I might jump off my balcony  <br>  That bitch was the first to lose </br>  <br>Childhood friends could never be legitimate love interest, silly.</br>  Holy fuck new chapter when? Why did the scanlation staff have to be cancer and go to AX?    <br>Oh, that is what you mean? No, she lost hard. Closure and everything.<br>Unsurprising, people need to act like that to spur the changes and plot advancement.<br><br>Such is the lot of best girl. I'm glad we at least got that much for her. More than some get.</br></br></br></br>  <br>God damn that is some shitty scanning. The Raws we had were better.</br>  <br> I watched the first episode and liked it, is manga good? </br>  <br>Would you mind posting it for comparison's sake</br>  <br><br>I watched the first episode and liked it, and am now reading the manga.<br><br>I'm a  faggot, I know </br></br></br></br>  the second episode is about Alium (Blue gir for animeonlyfag) introduction. I guess they delayed Mikan in the episode 03 but why did they introduce her in the episode 01?!<br><br>Synosps: <br><br>「正体がバレたら退学！」と父親に言われていた葉子のために、秘密がバレた<wbr>ことを秘密にする決意をした朝陽。しかし、放課後の教室でお弁当を食べてい<wbr>た葉子が油断して羽を出したところを、アイアンレディこと藍澤渚に目撃され<wbr>てしまう。このまま葉子の学園生活は終わってしまうのか！？<br><br><br>Pics related coming</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>the second pic from the EP02</br>  <br>last one</br>  <br><br>Unless he's referring to somewhere else than senmanga, I don't know what he's talking about.</br></br>  <br>judging from this: <br>it looks like they'll be introduced in the same episode</br></br>  <br>No, it happens when Alium discovers her too.</br>  this is from the Official website of course: http://jitsuwata.tv/story/  <br>Mikan is the one who gives her the food that causes that in the first place. So they would have to introduce her before that. It might be really brief in the anime though</br>  I have never seen a bunch of cunts who gets so up in arms over their love-it-or-hate-it artstyle.<br><br>The anime is easier to ingest, and I'm enjoying in just as much as I did the manga. You guys are fucking shit, the term secondary should have never left 2hu.</br></br>  <br>The blush does look better there.</br>  <br>They sort of did introduce Orange in episode 1 where she assaulted Shima, Okada and Sakurada.<br><br>And Alium is basically the secondary Girl in this series. She got the most focus and is the most popular, it isn't surprising they introduce her next after the Main Girl.</br></br></br>  <br>So that is how they translate the look?<br>I don't really care for it.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't dislike the manga art, I find it cute actually. It isn't mind-boggling gorgeous, but it has a certain charm that really fits the lightheartedness of the story.</br></br>  <br>it is UNIQUE and not generic</br>  <br>SOILED IT<br>SOILED IT<br>SOILED IT<br>SOILED IT<br>SOILED IT<br>SOILED IT</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Next chapter when??  <br> but it has a certain charm that really fits the lightheartedness of the story. <br><br>It sure does, but some people can't stomach it, the anime makes it palatable to them, even if it is leaning towards the generic side of character design now.</br></br></br>  <br>It's bizarre. They have noses and ears and everything.</br>  <br> voices in the manga <br><br>For those that missed the thread--</br></br></br>  <br><br>Reaction image saved.<br><br>This manga has some great faces so far, sheesh.<br><br><br><br>Some people lack appreciation for things that aren't simple anon. I often refer to them as plebeian.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Amazing meme of the season.</br>  <br>it could have been alot better, but still happy that they are doing this scene.</br>  <br> implying this trash is better than Nisekoi </br>  <br><br> You have already lost </br></br>  <br>The ride never ends</br>  <br><br>Take your h-doujinshi elsewhere.</br></br>  <br>We all know, she lost from chapter 1.</br>  <br>Not as bad as it could be, but it did make me smile for what that's worth.</br>  <br><br><br> tfw no more episodes of season two </br></br></br>  <br>Leaving this here.</br>  <br>It's about to turn from sappy love story to  happy love story, with dumpire losing control </br>  <br> She keeps losing every moment  </br>    <br><br>Posting spoilers without spoiler tag is against the rules.</br></br>    <br> Dumpire has to settle for used goods after Alium gets first kissu </br>  <br>Sue me, dickhead</br>  <br>Dumpire got the first kiss too.</br>  <br>Please stop being a bitch.

She's the most important girl for the plot.</br></br>  <br>Well, Alium is best girl.<br>Dumpire is best girl too though. I'm glad they're friends. More Alium/Dumpire chapters would be nice.</br></br>  <br>It is sad that she lost I suppose, but we all knew it was coming.<br>She was beautiful, even in her suffering.</br></br>  <br><br>People generally have two grandmothers.

She's pretty cute, cuter than she was that early in the manga, and her voice acting is much, much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine, does this do it for you?</br>  <br><br>She's a shit and deserved to lose.

I was really hoping that their voices would be a lot louder and crass (even the music out-sounds their voices at parts). That notion should have been long gone after the art releases, where it was obvious that they were selling the girls on plastic Barbie cuteness.</br></br>  <br>But isn't Karen best girl?</br>  <br>I almost feel like making a Do It For Her collage.</br>  <br>Karen is great, really really great.<br>Probably 3rd for me after Alium and Dumpire.

That would explain the alien ships in the future.</br></br></br></br>  <br> third panel eyes <br>Is she trying to be Kurusu Kimihito?</br></br>  <br> wanting a dub <br> not knowing how the shitty simuldubs work <br> they been <br> that's been <br> japan.. <br>Lurk moar, kill yourself, and get the fuck off my board.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dumpire blushes are seriously good too. Really, really great.<br><br>I wonder what Bakangel Blushu would be like though.</br></br></br>  <br>Just wait until Durriken shows up, and we get to see Alium go all Shojo-style.</br>  <br>That is not his name. His name is darling</br>  What the fuck are you talking about? The art is fucking great.  It reminds me of Yuna Kagesaki's art.   <br>I don't see the resemblance.</br>  <br><br>If they did dub it, they should give Dumpire a light german accent</br></br>  <br>clam yourself faggot. I didn't know about simuldubs.</br>  <br>Really? I do.</br>  <br> a light german accent <br>maybe. It could work.</br></br>  <br>Everyone has god tier blushes, even Kuromine.</br>  <br> Kansai-ben dub <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Wc2<wbr>H2Gr7kPg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I really didn't like Slutwolf early on, but her actually being a SECRET PURE GIRL adds a lot to her character.<br>  a cute &gt; a sexy </br></br>  <br><br> German <br> not Hungarian or Romanian </br></br></br>  <br>She has a better voice in the manga.</br>  <br>I wanna see how the VA handles more scenes before passing final judgment. Several of the voices were handled pretty damned well in the first episode, in my opinion.</br>  <br>Alium seems have overreactions to everything, with a strong personality. They gave her a seiyuu that mostly voices softspoken little girls, and doing it well.<br><br>She's clearly trying to go for something else from what I heard in the first episode, but it isn't really succeeding.</br></br></br>  So, I guess this is what happens when you get a studio that is used to just animating generic moe-blobs to do an adaptation of a manga with good artwork.  <br>It looks too much like "generic anime style". You know the "how to draw anime" style.</br>  someone pls spoonfeed me.<br>I can't find the first episode on nyaa.</br>  <br>Search "My monster secret"</br>  <br>The promotional art was pretty bad, but I think you guys are overreacting when it comes to the episodes themselves. <br>My only complaint is with the perpetual blushing in the majority of scenes. Everything else seems to be pretty solid even without being 1:1 to the manga.</br></br>  <br>still nothing on nyaa</br>  <br>fair enough, I don't really mind the blushing that much, its the way they did the eyes is what bugs me a little. The voices for most (not all) of the characters sounded flat. Those are my 2 biggest issues. other then those, I gotta agree it's still fairly solid.</br>  <br>use horrible subs or try "Jitsu wa watashi wa" on nyaa</br>  <br>Look for it yourself, it's not there.</br>  I only read this for the principal and shima.  <br><br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. <br>Horrible Subs links got taken down</br></br></br>  <br>Use the magnet links.<br><br>Anyone else trying to access nyaa's irc and failing?</br></br></br>  Chapter 85 translations when? I know they were busy at AX  <br><br> The voices for most (not all) of the characters sounded flat. <br>Which ones?<br>Asahi's voice is a pretty easy read of emotions.<br>The guys' voices seemed pretty perfect given the nature of their characters as sideline commentators.<br>Nothing seemed notably off about Sensei's.<br>Mikan's was the only one that stuck out to me, and even then it wasn't particularly bad, just not "naturally evil"  which I think isn't really a wrong either, given that it's suppose to be faked. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a bingo<br><br>And the manga is oddly unique. The special flavor of the comedy is extinguished with the anime, as well.</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about Yuna K's art.</br>  <br/>  <br>...only in the early chapters  it's called finding your own style, gaining stroke and not letting your shitty editors dictate your work </br>  <br>Actually, the mangaka's art in earlier manga looks like JwWw's art style in later chapters. He tried something new for the beginning of JwWw but reverted to his old style.</br>  <br>Try clicking on the link and select torrent. The nyaa page is down. Magnet still works though</br>  dumpirefags are as bad as kosakifags  Left or right?

That's double the work<br>B. We don't release subpar chapters. What's the point?<br>C. Even if we have translations, they still have to be proofed and typeset. That takes time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why do websites let urls like this exist</br>  <br>Is this a meme now?</br>  <br>If your current bottleneck is not at the translation stage, what's stopping your translators from working ahead so they can work less later?</br>  <br>life</br>  <br><br>Twas before my time. Either way, the rest of the chapter isn't horrible right? I'll see if I can get you a propper translation.<br><br><br><br>They have. We have chapter translations through chapter 90. But again, they need proofing, and typesetting, both of which take time. Plus, even if you use senmanga raws, you still have to erase the text before slapping new text on. And that's even harder to do if it's not leveled correctly. And if you go and do ALL that, you're practically doing the entire chapter anyway, so why not do it right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Twas <br>Kill yourself, redditfag</br></br>  <br>It's about doing minor fixes. The sort of QC that couldn't be done as effectively back then. The page I linked had a duplicate bubble, but the rest of the chapter is perfectly fine.<br><br>I'm not saying use senmanga for the images, I'm only saying use them for the text in the bubbles to generate a backlog of scripts for the future, which will prevent the translation stage from becoming the bottleneck.</br></br></br>  does fmd just not work with batoto anymore? even the latest version isn't letting me download this, and yet it keeps asking me to update, and when I do, it crashes.  <br><br>I see what you're saying. The problem is that our proofer can only go so fast. Another issue is that even if I were to typeset the pages, they end up getting rotated and cropped when they are cleaned and leveled, so all the text would have to be fixed afterwards.<br><br>I want Jitsu to be speed up as well, but the order of operations is there for a reason. I know 85 has taken a while, but it's because life happened. I'm still trying to contact two members who wandered off somewhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then just do quick fixes to glaring issues that people point out.</br>  <br>Plus the "norway" in pic related needs to fucking die.</br>  <br><br>So, I can only say that we will never use 'norway'. I don't remember why that slipped through, possibly I didn't notice it or didn't get a chance to correct it, but we have enough people now that we won't be doing stuff like that.</br></br>  Why is the main characters arms and legs so long?  <br>They only get really long for joke purposes. Otherwise they seem to be normal length.</br>  <br> tfw redneck <br> tfw girls dressed in any sort of flannel is my fetish </br></br>  <br>oh really?

I'm willing to bet she is also 23, and Dumon treats her like a hag just for the fuck of it.</br>  <br>If you can't appreciate that you are the one that has the problem.</br>  Anyone has the webm of Asahi running from Dumon in the Op?  <br>She's much older than that for sure. She's probably between 30 and 40.</br>  <br>No, she's a christmas cake.</br>  <br>That's really close to how it was in the manga.</br>  <br>She's older.</br>  <br> A gay one too. <br>Would a gay student be in love with this charming young girl?</br></br>  <br><br>Please be trolling</br></br>  <br>I'd say she's past 25, but not 30 yet. Probably 27-28</br>  <br>We can't really know her real age, but I'm sure she's older than that.</br>   shiho will never tease you under the table   I really really really want some based translatordude to appear and give us text translations for the rest of chapters like we have for Prison School or Boku Girl.<br>FwPA are nice, but they will never catch up with their pace.</br>  the anime is shiiiiit!  I must say that the anime with its art design is not the best but overall it is a good adaption.<br>However more important is, where is the new translated chapter? Tarage where art thou?</br>  <br>Read the thread, it looks like FwPA already posted the sick deets.<br> And now I'm going to kill myself for actually typing out "sick deets". </br></br>  <br>you should</br>  <br>Sayonara.</br>  <br> Sakurada wants Sensei <br><br>When is this happening, anyway?

Mostly Alium but the Chou a la Creme scene is in there which probably means that they'll rush through Mikan's intro and meeting with Dumpire</br>            <br>Post flustered densei.</br>    <br/>      <br>AOTY</br>    <br><br> I concede </br></br>    I haven't gone to my specific folder...  <br>You were a worthy adversary.

Manako started getting popular, and then within like, the past 2 weeks, Zombina's had a massive surge in popularity.<br><br>I dunno if it's because of people seeing her official color scheme or what. <br><br>Not that I'm complaining. I've a Zombina fan for ages. She was the girl that got me into MonMus in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who said I don't like Tio? She's just second to Zombina.</br>  <br>what moe?</br>  <br>But her official color scheme has green hair and patchwork skin, what the fuck is this shit.</br>  Objectively the best race  <br>No, it doesn't. It never did. Zombina was never in a full colour page. The only time she was ever green was in fan colored imaged.</br>    <br>Take away one eye from a human and you get the worst monstergirl design.</br>  <br>MEIN NEGER</br>  <br>Red makes her look much cuter anyway.</br>  <br>if thats her voice singing in the ED then I love it</br>  <br> Dat orc ass </br>  <br>GOAT tier taste</br>  <br>Yeah, I was never fond of floating eyeballs either.<br><br>I blame watching The Crawling Eye as a kid. ...Though it made watching The Cloud fucking hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Animeonly fags are the reason why I guess.</br>  <br>Do you think Zombina ever swaps out or replaces her body parts when they get too broken up?</br>  <br> orc <br><br>really</br></br></br>  <br>Rein pls go</br>  This whole chapter in anime form  <br><br><br><br>Big tits are gross.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's an ogre, not an orc.

I get 'big' and 'tits' but the rest makes no sense.</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty good height reference. Carts like that are generally designed to come up to the waist of a normal person, making the table of it about a meter or so up. Cerea confirmed for just under two meters tall!</br>  Tio is simply the best girl in the manga.<br><br> After Mia. </br></br>  <br>Probably.</br>  <br>I figured she does it all the time, considering her line of work. Hell, for all we know, she has a scalp of green hair somewhere.</br>  So this is the ranking for MC tiers right?<br><br>A Team<br> Harem (includes Lala) <br><br>B Team<br> Mon plus Smith <br><br>C Team<br> Reacurring Monster girls like lillith and lesbian dragon <br><br>D Team<br> one shots like farm animals and yuki onna </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Is that Mero or Centorea?

Were most likely not going to see them again (the oneshots).</br></br>  <br>Yu-oneesan is always best girl.</br>  <br><br>I wonder what happens when Tio gets a little alcohol in her.<br><br>As an Oni, wouldn't she be a bit of a heavy drinker, and become notably rough while tipsy?</br></br></br></br>  <br> She had her Darling time. <br>No she fucking didnt. She needs her own fucking chapter.</br></br>  <br>Just stating girls with small chests are far superior.</br>  <br>Nothing at all, IMO. Zombina just seems to be the kind who would prefer more dakka-dakka over the old slashy-stabby.<br><br><br>Thought it was in terms of popularity for a moment there.

I wish I could do more but I don't have any fruit to draw on at this moment. The best you can do is save that picture.</br>  Can we expect any character development or are we just gonna see them between MC's interactions with the three fantasy girls?  <br>24</br>  <br> character development <br><br>For some characters, but not MC or the significant JSDF members (MC's division and a couple of others). Although I only read the manga, I imagine he ends up changing a bit  following the gates temporary closure . Kind of unfortunate really, I'd add alot to series if it was one of the focuses (Could swap out the brief politics stuff with it and everyone would be happy).<br>Plenty of relationship development though (for everyone but MC, who intentionally restrains himself like most Harem MC, he comes close to having sex with Rori, but author cockblocks him at the last moment).</br></br></br></br>  <br>They've gone through two manga chapters in the first two episodes, it's not an unusual pace.<br><br>If it keeps this pace, the first 24 eps will end right as they all return from their Japan trip, with ample material left over.</br></br></br>  Does the Japanese army actually have women on the front lines? It seems very unrealistic.  <br>I don't think so. But for a recon unit if might be a different thing.</br></blockquote>]
