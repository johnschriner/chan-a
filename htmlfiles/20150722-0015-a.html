Anime uploads are no longer allowed on nyaa???  <br>It's just one sub group, but still, that sucks.</br>   AnimeRG <br><br>And nothing of value was lost.</br></br>  literally who  <br>I've never even heard of those guys. That's how insignificant they are.</br>  <br>Damn that sucks. Any idea why?</br>  Is this why SubaHibi is delayed? herkz please.  It would be interesting to know the reason for the block though.<br><br>I doubt it's because of bad quality when shit like Hadena is allowed on Nyaa.</br></br>  Just the cartel protecting their territory.  <br>Hadena is allowed ironically because Hadena have a history of making people shit their lungs out with laughter.</br>  <br>Nyaa mafia.<br><br>Nothing new.</br></br></br>  Just your usual Nyaa cartel bullying.  <br>I don't give a fuck who uploads what and it doesn't matter if AnimeRG's subs are shit. The fact that he's bitching about herkz makes me feel better. Any negative feedback that this guy gets is good in my book.</br>  DAIIIIIIIIZZZZZZZZZZZZ   herkz <br><br>literally who</br></br>   Fansub Drama <br><br>Really?</br></br>   nyaa <br>literally why the age of streaming and instant anime watching is here stop being a autist hipster shit and wathc anime like the rest of the world does</br>  <br>http://ask.fm/Xythar/answer/1307577<wbr>23000</wbr></br>  so, what exactly where they banned for?  <br>And we thought fansubbing was ded</br>  <br>That faggot with the giant pony avatar.</br>  <br>moot's second name</br>  Are these the same faggots that tried to tell me TT was redundant? I don't even use their dumb site, why does this matter?   AnimeRG <br>Wow it's fucking nothing.</br>   which rule did they broke specifically?  <br>[herkz] bitrate-starved remakes<br>[herkz] not flagging torrents that use other people's subs as remakes<br>[herkz] uploading 1080p encodes from CR<br>[herkz] uploading 1080p tv encodes not from one of the few stations where it's allowed<br>[herkz] ordered from what happens the most to least<br><br>so they just fucked up. Time to move on I guess</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Look, as much as I like to mock the so-called cartel (e.g. the one time Nyaa went down not long after Daiz and his anti TT tirade), this time, they did the right thing.</br></br>   ayy <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Yes, anime is now banned on Nyaa. The website will be from now on about material that helps you becoming a carpenter.<br><br><br><br><br>They were pretty much just ripping Funi and CR stuff like HorribleSubs does. Unless I'm missing something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Anon, you are still retarded even if you think that you are only doing it "ironically".</br>  <br> [herkz] uploading 1080p tv encodes not from one of the few stations where it's allowed <br>What does this mean? You're allowed to upload tv encodes from some stations but not from the others? How come?</br></br>  the fansub cartel is known to bounce people off of nyaa. it's a good reason why we should never let fucking daiz completely consolidate his grip.<br><br>like Doki was b&amp;, too, because one of their members was stirring shit with nyaa. but the funny thing is the guy who GOT doki b&amp; was kicked out of their group for being a fucking faggot, but the guy joined one of the sub cartel's approved groups while Doki remained blacklisted. <br><br>Herkz+Daiz just carry stupid grudges.</br></br></br></br>  Isn't AnimeRG just another Horriblesubs clone?<br><br>They sometimes rip whenever HS fucks up or is late with their rips.</br></br>  <br>Because some stations have terrible video quality.</br>  <br>Anon, you are not the smartest guy around, are you?</br>  <br>Okay, but why should that be banned?<br>It's one thing to ban people because they steal subs and stuff like that, but this seems a bit over the top.</br></br>  <br> [herkz] bitrate-starved remakes <br>deadfish<br><br> [herkz] not flagging torrents that use other people's subs as remakes <br><br>Why aren't commie flagged as remakes for using CR's subs?

Station means TV station, right? Or did I misread that?</br>  <br>Because there is no reason to upload a 4k video of a station that only broadcasts in 720P? Use your brain for a second.</br>  <br>It makes no sense to upload 1080p (because mostly they're upscales from 720p)</br>  <br> Herkz+Daiz just carry stupid grudges. <br><br>They're unnecessary retards. Nyaa is unneeded compared with the huge amount of other anime trackers out there and fansubs will hopefully die even further so we're left with actual fansubs and not these e-whores</br></br></br>  Commie a  meme shit  Is there a bigger faggot than herkz left in the anime scene? Koda was notorious bitch she doesn't even come close to this colossal homosexual.  <br><br> mostly <br><br>Digital anime has finally caught up to the point where you can go for 1080p on BD releases to get the best possible quality.</br></br></br></br>  Scenefags are fucking autists. So long as I can get my chinese cartoons, I could give 0 fucks about them.  herkz-senpai, I know you're reading this thread so please screencap my post and share it on twitter  <br>Nyaa has the highest standards of any anime torrent site. I mean it's run by Comeme staff and Mr. 10bit himself Daiz, so only the highest QUALITY subs and encodes are allowed.</br>  <br> that only broadcasts in 720P? <br><br>Please stop talking.</br></br></br>   I grew up with downloading torrents from Nyaa to watch my One Piece and Naruto Shippuden <br>Good fucking riddance.</br>  Holy shit! we don't give a fuck, OP.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br>  <br>But what if they don't have access to any other source, or this source is the quickest one? Surely as long as it's properly tagged, there's nothing bad with it?</br>  <br> Nyaa has the highest standards of any anime torrent site. <br><br> the retards who run nyaa probably actually think this <br><br>hilarious</br></br></br></br></br>  inb4 Daiz comes in and goes full damage control  <br>Do you think reddit gives a fuck about torrenting and sub-groups, newfag?</br>  Just another reason to use TokyoToshokan instead of nyaa.  <br>Anon please, fansub drama is like one of the foundation of /a/.</br>  <br>Don't forget that they also employ the help of the Independent Quality Checkers™ to make sure that the recommended subs are chosen in an unbiased manner and not simply because they are cartel members. For real!</br>  <br>It's probably still true, since most trackers don't have any standards at all.</br>  <br> 10-bit game of thrones exists </br>   AnimeRG <br>Nothing value was lost.</br>  <br><br>Only if you're new</br></br>  <br>Uh, yes, caring about attention whores sounds exactly like the kind of pointless autistic shit that would occur on reddit.</br>  <br>Doing one of these is not a problem, doing all of these in a constant base is.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Shows higher than 720p:<br><br>Vampire Holmes - 1080p<br>Grisaia - 1080p<br>Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches - 810p<br>Future Card Buddyfight 100 - 1080p<br>Hibike!

The worst part is someone with zero social skills helps run it, and the other guy just wants to force his encoding memes onto people because it subjectively looks better to him.<br><br>If AnimeRG had such egregious problems with their release, I don't understand how Comeme's Yahari release got through with 8man being in a batman mask last season other than herkz approving it and being an ebin troll xD.<br><br>Also this group is autistic enough to come to /a/ to attempt to poorly troll threads with dubs. I wouldn't doubt that they seek out these threads - or just outright make them - just to cap posts and then get hugboxed by their two or three followers on Twitter. It's a sad fansub world we are living in anons.</br></br></br></br></br>  AnimeRG did shit all, there was no reason for them to even exist.  <br> haven't used <br>haven't used Nyaa for quite a while.</br></br>  <br> we didn't do anything wrong <br> blocked with no reason at all <br><br>Maybe they should've actually read the rules for once.<br><br>And it's funny that they make a blogpost saying this kind of shit after someone from their staff was explicitly told all the rules they broke on a regular basis.<br><br>Also any of you are confused as to what those rules exactly means, you are welcome to consult the rules page for clarification: http://www.nyaa.se/?page=manual</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   he still hasn't learned japanese   <br>You</br>  <br> Nyaa mafia. <br><br>Don't you mean Nyaafia?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah so why would you need another group that does it?</br>  <br>I don't.</br>  <br>So why are groups like Commie allowed that break those rules?</br>  <br>Kill yourself, you bald jew.</br>  <br>Sometimes HS bot fucks up or are late with their rips.<br><br>And sometimes they don't even rip or delay certain shows if another high profile group is working on subs.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what's wrong with CR rips? HS dropped the ball once in a while.</br>   mods deletes legitimate anime threads <br> but not this fansub drama bullshit </br>  <br>The wording by herkz is admittedly a bit confusing if you're not familiar with the rules, but "uploading 1080p encodes from CR" here means that they were making their own 1080p encodes from web sources like CR, which is currently disallowed by default:<br><br> Web source video is limited to 1280x720p or source resolution, whichever is lower. <br><br>(You can try to argue for exceptions - this is what happened with Working S3 this season, but these guys obviously never did that)<br><br>And for TV channel 1080p encodes:<br><br> TV source video is by default limited to 1440x1080p. The BS11, BS-NTV, NHK-BS Premium, and WOWOW channels are limited to 1920x1080p. SD channels, however, are limited to 480p. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And here he is, like clockwork.</br>  <br>Well I do and I don't approve of you.</br>  <br>Examples, darling.</br>    <br>Daiz will you guys drop Gangsta if the editor doesn't show up anymore?</br>  <br> bitrate-starved remakes <br> not flagging torrents that use other people's subs as remakes <br> uploading 1080p encodes from CR <br>Those mememasterz making us laugh again ;^)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Underwater has quite a lot releases that use subs from Crunchyoll and none of them are flagged as remakes.</br>  <br> wonderful people like HorribleSubs <br><br>top lol</br></br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/delete<wbr>d/deleted/type/op/</wbr></br>  <br><br>The grand fool arrives</br></br>  <br>They don't?<br><br><br>Using official scripts and such has always been exempt from the remake policy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Implying /a/ mods are no part of the cartel</br>  <br> Using official scripts and such has always been exempt from the remake policy <br>Yet AnimeRG got banned for that...</br></br>  <br>But wouldn't they immediately delete this thread to help their comrades cover up this gross injustice?</br>  <br>But doesn't HS upload 1080p too? Why aren't they banned?</br>  <br>Summon Daiz for control damage</br>  <br>What are the SD channels?</br>  <br>Nope. Even if something doesn't count as a remake rules about encoding from web sources etc still apply.<br><br><br>HS rips things, they don't encode them.<br><br>CR encodes 1080p video -&gt; HS rips said 1080p video (okay) -&gt; AnimeRG makes a new 1080p encode from said video (not okay)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3dpd shit <br>auto delete<br> sales thread <br>mods are KyoAni apologists. nothing to see here<br> posting video for views <br>delete<br> /pol/ thread <br> /mu/ thread <br> same thinly veiled SAO bait thread <br> western cartoon <br> thinly veiled SAO bait thread <br>mods SAO apologists. nothing to see here<br> /v/ thread <br><br>I don't see a problem with any of these</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, they should have been banned years ago along with gg.<br><br>Of course they give themselves a free pass since they run the site.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, such quality anime threads.</br>  <br> CR encodes 1080p video -&gt; HS rips said 1080p video (okay) -&gt; AnimeRG makes a new 1080p encode from said video (not okay) <br>What difference does it make?<br>I don't get it.<br>I don't know anything about computers, why is this bad? From my PoV it seems pretty arbitrary.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> this post created solely to slide the entire thread into encode discussion <br><br>the damage control is real</br></br></br></br>  Good thing CR and funi are subbing pretty much everything relevant these days.  <br>Autism Herkz, Daiz and co don't want people to see that others can do their work far better.</br>  <br> CR encodes are official so if you don't like them you can fuck off <br> ARG are not so it's them who must fuck off </br></br>  <br>It's done to enforce the meme cartel monopoly. If people were allowed to make their own encodes then the scene would be flooded with 3rd party releases and the popularity of HS (and the other from the cartel) will drop immensely. It's a simple racketing tactic.</br>  <br>The definition of "troll torrent" is "torrent that claims to be one thing but is another", not "translation which people on /a/ happen to dislike". Even then, it's a very rarely enforced rule.</br>  <br> reencoding lossy source <br>Try saving one .jpg file several times and see the results. They could have just used HS video without reencoding it.</br></br>  <br>This. Fansubbing is deprecated.</br>  <br>Please no bully.<br><br>No need to attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance and what not.</br></br></br>  <br> CR encodes 1080p video -&gt; HS rips said 1080p video (okay) <br><br> We are a fansub group. We translate, time, encode, and edit our own shows. We do not rip our shows from Crunchyroll or the likes. </br></br></br>  I'm glad, this autistic shitter was spamming my RSS with shitty uploads, seemed full of himself (I assume it's one person).   Xythar <br> Daiz <br><br>Show your face herkz</br></br></br>  <br><br>Your RSS was set up incorrectly.</br></br>  <br>Commie releases Symphogear under "English translated" and they haven't been banned for their trolling.</br>  <br> mfw this is secretly a ritual to summon koda and the gg gang back </br>  <br> CR source is lossless <br>You are a special kind of idiot, are you not?</br></br>  <br>He's too busy making screencaps to post on twitter with snarky remarks.</br>  <br><br><br> deadfish <br>nope, just re-encoding group without filtering with shit parameter like that every devices can run them<br><br> Why aren't commie flagged as remakes for using CR's subs? Same with other groups <br>Because there's works on them, not just remuxing the subs<br><br> HS <br>I'm pretty sure that he's talking about re-encoding CR 1080p without downscaling the video.<br><br>AnimeRG is literally worthless, they're basically just a re-uploading group.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe that people aren't mentioning DameDame.</br>  <br>The only way to set it up "correctly" in that case would be to change it to filter out the 3-4 different names this kid would use to label his shitty torrents. I use RSS to quickly browse the torrent list, not to download stuff automatically.</br>  <br> not including you're favourite encoder/subber in your feed  <br>Casual shiiit</br></br>   Xythar actually responding to shit on /a/ instead of just screenshotting it and circlejerking about it on Twitter with Herkz <br><br>What's going on?</br></br>  <br>His butt hurts.<br> From what? <br>herkz</br></br></br>  <br>Who said that? HS ripped CR and got lossy video which those guys then took and reencoded again making it worse. If they want to make their own subs or whatever, they should have used untouched video from HS release.</br>  <br> reencoding lossy source <br>That's already happening, some of the larger groups now use filtered CR 1080p down to 720p re-encodes for certain releases.</br></br>  <br> Don't tell anyone but they're the same people </br>  <br>Learn to read herkz.</br>  <br>Hi, thanks for all the subs this season.</br>  Reminder that the only thing Daiz did right was BTFO the CEO of crunchy on leddit.  <br>I was going to include a bit at the end of my post saying "and if anyone is thinking of being super hilariously clever by saying Commie are only pretending to be fansubs, maybe come up with something slightly more original" but I thought I'd give you the benefit of the doubt. You really are that predictable, huh?</br>   Daiz will never get executed for his crimes against humanity    2015 <br> nyaa <br><br>just let this meme die already and move on to AB like the rest of us</br></br></br>  <br> now <br>They have been doing this for many years, but it's not the same as reencoding without downscaling.</br></br>  <br>And they're all Daiz.</br>  <br>I'm killing time while I wait for NNB to be typeset.<br><br><br>Sure, no prob.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Haven't they died off?</br>  <br>HS surely at least reencodes Funi, if nothing else. So the whole argument of encoding already lossy encodes is completely invalid and used only to bully groups that are not part of the cartel.</br>  <br>I don't know what's true and what's wrong anymore. People say they're the same person, people say Daiz and HorribleSubsLeader are the same person, people say Nyaa and Daiz are the same person. Just how many people are there in the cartel?</br>  <br>Anime Junkies</br>  <br>Any news on Gangsta?</br>  <br>Fuck no. Do you want them to start plaguing AB instead?</br>  <br>I don't seed.</br>  <br>1 person using a lot of different names.</br>  <br>One and it's Daiz.</br>  <br>That doesn't mean that you should go and reencode HS release again.</br>  <br>Only one, but they are many.</br>  <br>There's always ever only been Daiz.</br>    <br>Just one</br>  <br>And I was going to write an amazing argument where I show how you're full of shit but I knew you wouldn't read anyway because you and you're weeaboo tea club must always be the right ones.<br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br> AB <br> weekly releases <br> not an even bigger cartel </br></br></br>  <br> Because there's works on them, not just remuxing the subs <br><br>Shitty 'edits' are not 'works', fuck off you pissbrain.<br><br> AnimeRG is literally worthless <br><br>Nyaa is literally worthless, they're just another anime torrent site.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daiz is running this show but he's a bald faggot.</br>  <br>But it makes the whole argument complete bullshit, you dumb cunt. That's why everyone hates you memesub cartelfags.</br>  Just came in here to say Herkz is a queer.  <br>I have a data limit so I can't seed</br>  <br>I actually like HorribleSubsLeader their shit always makes me laugh</br>  <br><br> AB <br> not weekly releases <br><br>You're pretty slow aren't you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HS does not re-encode anything. Anyone can do what they do and be within the rules.<br><br>Anyone can also use any simulcast script they like without it counting as a remake, since those scripts are available to all. The only time it's a remake is if you use the script from another fansub release.</br></br></br>  <br>Funi releases are shitty though, any group that rip it must reencode that shit.</br>  <br>Anon let me tell you something.  You are Daiz, too. </br>    <br>There has only been an experience with a couple of shows last season m8.</br>  <br>It only does that if you're stupid. There's a difference between one reencode and two. Again, why not just use untouched video without making it even worse than it already may be?</br>  <br><br> They don't? <br>pic related. I guess it's ok for Comeme, but no one else.</br></br></br>  anyone who gives a fuck uses AB anyways  Who the fuck cares about AnimeRG?  <br>Did you know? There is a  Daiz!H.264  inside of you!</br>  <br>But they aren't fansubs Xythar, they are memesubs, the worst kind<br><br>Screencap this post now and make snarky comments about me on twitter, feed that ego of yours a little</br></br></br>  <br>Casuals that don't know anything about the scene and just want to pirate they aneemaymays</br>   fansub drama   <br><br> doesn't know <br><br>pretty slow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still not a troll torrent. It's softsubbed and the actual subs are perfectly fine.<br><br>Funny how people are quick to complain about this but nobody ever complains that WhyNot's release of the final episode of s1 was a troll for replacing the OP audio with Batman music. Ever considered that it might not be NT's pro-Commie bias but rather your anti-Commie bias?</br></br></br>  I'm all for bashing Commie cartel, but can anyone seriously read the OP image and be on the side of that pretentious idiot?<br><br>This is spoken on behalf of the Japanimation Consortium of Quadruple Channel (JCQC).</br></br>  <br> Twintails <br>Bam.</br></br>  <br>Go kill yourself daiz</br>  <br>Can we really assume though that casuals know how to use torrents? I thought they just watched their shit on youtube?</br>  <br> He's a big bully <br> no 4u joke <br>They really need to step their game up</br></br></br>  <br>Then link me NNB 2nd episode on AB.</br>  <br>Every casual and their mom has utorrent.</br>  <br>Commie's basically the godfather of the cartel nowadays.</br>  <br>I excrete him two times a day I i eat enough fiber so there no problem.</br>  <br>Seems like every time someone gets banned on Nyaa they always give the same answer "they didn't follow the rules!" but refuse to state specifically what rule it was they broke.<br><br>Sounds fishy to me. I don't mind much when it's just shit groups like this, but still I'd rather those guys didn't arbitrarily decide to shut out groups like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Again, it doesn't matter. Who gives a fuck about some random group that "produced" shit? This is about herkz being the biggest faggot on this planet.</br>  <br><br>I thought this was  funny. </br></br>  <br>By the way, I hope you don't take people here seriously when they talk about subs, parroting shit about the "cartel"; it's all jokes, like Daiz killing fansubs and such (he's still a faggot for being a fakku s̶h̶i̶l̶l unofficial PR). The ones who are serious are either newfags or straight-out idiots.</br>  <br/>  <br>Aside from not being funny it's not even well done.<br>If you're going to pull this shit at least put the effort in and use curves rather than straight lines.</br></br>  <br>HS does re-encode Funi because at least the colour palette is changed.<br><br><br>So are CR.<br><br><br> There's a difference between one reencode and two. <br>Yea, the difference being that one of them is by a cartel-approved group.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   not using AB <br> not having daiz filtered <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Ever consider that you're a fucking faggot?</br>  <br>But then he wouldn't be  edgy </br>  <br>Well ok then, I guess that's fair enough.<br><br>Still haven't seen an adequate explanation for why Doki is banned though</br></br></br>  <br>It's shit and the retard who QC'd it should hang himself.<br>And you who whiteknights him should kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Sorry we're not as cool as you.</br>  <br>Was shitposting part of your plan?</br>  We have a picture of Daiz, can Xythar or herkz give us one? I always imagined Xythar to be 6'2 and pretty lean.  <br> Yea, the difference being that one of them is by a cartel-approved group. <br>Ok, I see you're just pretending to be retarded.</br></br>  <br>Trying to take down Nyaa's domain is not a good enough reason?</br>  <br>The answer is that daiz is trying to kill fansubbing.</br>  <br>AB is still not ideal for currently airing stuff. When they get the kinks worked out of that I'll probably not bother with nyaa much anymore. (Though then again most sub groups upload directly to Nyaa so even then I'd just be imposing extra delay on myself to go elsewhere.)</br>  <br>What do you expect from an anime fansub tracker? I'm just glad they channel their faggotry by dealing with annoying uploaders who contribute nothing.</br>  <br> wanting these plebs to go to AB <br>It's like you wish reddit will die without realizing that they're there as containment and therefore necessary evil.</br></br>  <br>No one cares about the faggot in the OP, after reading his blog post, he's probably some reddit faggot who just recently got into anime. This is about herkz and the memecartel</br>  <br>That has nothing to do with their fansubs. Nyaa decided that their fansubs should not be uploaded to the site. This should only be done because of a specific problem with the content itself, not some other retarded scene drama.</br>  <br>I don't even know why you keep replying to me. You are obviously from the cartel and I obviously would never believe your lies.</br>  <br>There's another faggot, see .</br>  <br>herkz is a Russian that can't squat.</br>  <br>Of course!</br>  <br>That has been explained many times. They uploaded Princess Lover OVA (hentai) to Nyaa instead of sukebe. Multiple times despite the warning.</br>  <br> not making use of the multiple options <br> being such a snowflake and using filters <br><br>Stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AB is by far worse than reddit. Just see the IDC and you'll understand. At least reddit watches anime. Also, most ABusers have reddit and MAL accounts, and there is even a podcast. <br>Stop being so elitist.</br></br>  <br>So because of that one bad upload, now none of their good uploads are allowed on the site either, no matter who actually uploads them?<br><br>That's bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck do you even care whats on nyaa besides elitist bullshit? its just a fucking tracker.<br><br>if people want to download animeRG just let them</br></br></br>  <br> not making use of the multiple options <br><br>hi reddit</br></br></br>  <br>I used to, but these days I don't pay a lot of attention. I have a lot of things to do and reading random flames and shitposts isn't very productive.<br><br><br>Nope. They just tag it with the correct colour matrix. You can do the same with two keypresses in madVR, and it should be pretty obvious that no re-encoding is happening there.<br><br><br>Every day, anon, every day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Absolute worst people in fansubbing rankings:<br><br>1. People who don't contribute anything and dedicate a site to complaining about subs, even though they don't know Japanese (Dark Sage)<br>2. People who don't contribute anything and complain (/a/)<br><br>that is all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>suck my butt</br></br>  <br>Nice one AnimeRG devs.<br><br><br> not a troll torrent <br>Yeah, that's definitely not a troll torrent, but you can't say that the subs were meme-free.<br><br><br> HS does re-encode Funi because at least the colour palette is changed. <br>I won't bother explain but it's just some parameter in the MKV container.<br> Yea, the difference being that one of them is by a cartel-approved group. <br>So you're the type of anon that have been baited hard and trust 4chan meme? Welcome here, newfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hahahaha, top kek thread. <br><br>Pays off knowing Japanese, I can just observe all this from a distance.</br></br>  <br> hentai <br>TLR is also hentai, then?</br></br>  <br> joining a private tracker for the forums <br>lol</br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, it was done in such a manner(through softsubs) than it technically didn't violate the rules, but as such it would come down to a mod decision on whether to keep it or not. I assume herkz giggled at [WhyNot]'s release so it was allowed and he helped create the s2 end episode shenanigans as well so it was also allowed.<br><br>A double standard, but I can't say that it surprises me.<br><br><br>Hi random Comeme twitter follower!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Commie <br> Effort </br></br>  <br> Every day, anon, every day. <br><br>Did you figure it out?</br></br></br>  <br>Because I can't find what I want with their garbage polluting it. Also kept uploading bad encodes with hardsubs and dubs of individual episodes of series aired years ago in various resolutions like the dumb attention whoring faggots they are.</br>  <br>So now we learned that we can put up whatever shit on video as long as it's softsubbed, upload it on nyaa, and that will be perfectly fine.<br>I'm going to screencap this post and save it for future use.</br></br>  <br>Couldn't they deal with it like adults and just ban the users instead of the group releases?</br>  <br><br>I want to join you, how is the view?</br></br>  Wait, I thought everyone here used Crunchyroll?<br><br>Don't you fucking faggots even support the industry</br></br>   nyaa <br>reddit: the tracker</br>  <br>Dark Sage is the best thing to have come out of anime. His shit is hilarious.</br>  <br> not using netflix <br>Full pleb</br></br>  <br>Epic response mate, now ss this and post it on IDC for dem epik circlejerk. <br><br><br>Little baby can't admit his sekrit klub is worse than MAL.</br></br></br></br>  <br> AB is by far worse than reddit.  <br> Just see the IDC <br>And /a/ is on the same site as /b/. Your point?<br><br>Note: I don't give a shit about AB's community and freely use whichever (AB, Nyaa, BBT etc) has better seeds. However, deriding the entire site based on one forum that exists practically as a containment forum, is just silly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daiz is HorribleSubsLeader and HorribleSubs is a CR proxy.</br>  <br>How do you know I'm not an encoder and fansubber of fine Japanimation who likes shitposting on the side?</br>  <br> Because I can't find what I want with their garbage polluting it. <br><br>congratz you are actually retarded</br></br></br>   cartel <br>Nice meme everyone.</br>  <br>Yeah, you go on downloading your torrents from MAL then.<br><br>Oh wait, you can't, you fucking retard</br></br></br>  I love fansub drama. I think I almost like it more than anime itself. So many theories and conspiracy's, the fun never ends!  I FUCKING love how neither Xythar nor Daiz can come up with anything smart/fun to defend themselves but are butthurt enough to stay in the thread shitposting with retarded one liners  <br>Princess Lover OVA, not the series, IS hentai.</br>  Is this the shitposting thread of the hour?  <br>You're right, honestly. This was one of the funniest sagas in Fansub drama in quite a while.<br><br>http://www.crymore.net/2014/12/30/f<wbr>ansub-gratipay-drama-or-how-i-learn<wbr>ed-to-crowdfund-for-the-sake-of-gen<wbr>erosity-and-love/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, go nuts.</br></br>  <br> I-It's just a meme, guys!!1 </br>  <br>Obviously, if your upload has not even a semblance of being a proper English translation, that's sufficient grounds to delete it if it's uploaded under the English-translated category.<br><br>Don't take my word for it; some of skiddiks's troll releases were deleted for that reason.</br></br></br>  <br> I used to, but these days I don't pay a lot of attention <br>Yeah, that's my point. It's all jokes and fun here with some legit stupidity every now and then. If you don't have the time, can't get the humor, or you can't appreciate the variety, including the dumb shit, then you really shouldn't bother. Anyway, appreciate what you're doing, and probably lots of people here do too, even if not vocal. And thanks for stopping by.</br></br>  <br>what do the arrows mean?</br>  <br>Love.</br>  <br> Just because an OVA is 18+ rated and has sex it's a hentai <br><br>No!

That whole scene she looked weird. In some thread from weeks ago someone was saying that based off the way the narrator was describing the character in the LN is how they end up looking in the anime.

Also note that monkey thinks senj the bestest.</br>  <br><br><br>Huh, I thought they were the same person too.

As Shinobu she's not technically a vampire. However, the real answer is that humanity expects vampires to be sexually attractive and a pale, gaunt face isn't beautiful on a woman.</br>  What has science done?  <br>Looks like a pokemon.</br>  <br>diamonds</br>  <br>I'm not sure if it's wonderful or horrifying.</br>  <br>Capture her and check her stats.</br>  <br>Like the perfect woman</br>  PV never  oh  wish i had a family  <br>like this?</br>  <br> that belly <br>What a fatty.</br></br>  If there are no bystanders in Monogatari because Araragi doesn't notice/care about them, and Araragi's intimate moments with Hitagi are never shown, doesn't that mean Araragi gives no fucks about their intimate relationship? (Assuming they really even have one.)   28 matches   <br>I mean, even if you don't know the character.

Kiss shot a beauty  <br>Yes, she got renamed after becoming depressed after losing her powers and turning into a loli. Shinobu is a play on her old name of kiss shot.

Just saying in case the FBI is watching.  <br>At this point it's obvious he's just hunting for (You)s. Stop giving them to him.</br>  <br>alright im sorry<br><br>you have to live in a place that respects your freedoms</br></br></br>  <br>It's this sort of stupid vanity that makes her extra adorable.</br>  Reminder not to feed him  <br> Personally I'm most fond of teenage Shinobu <br><br>If you don't love every form of Shinobu you don't actually love her, you only see her as another girl to jerk off too.<br><br>Loli/teenage/adult-only Shinobu fans should just leave the thread and go to the generic loli/teenage/adult thread instead. This thread is for true Shinobu lovers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Truth.</br>  Why am I so fascinated with this creature?  <br>That's like saying you can't have any preferences for, say, the way a character wears her hair. Really it's the ponytail that does it for me, not the body type.<br><br> And the hoody, good lord do I like girls who wear hoodies </br></br></br>  <br>Everyone has preferences though. Just because you prefer a form because of the aesthetic or sexual appeal doesnt mean you love her less.</br>  <br>You are conflicted by an urge to protect, knowing at the same time that she could effortlessly destroy you.</br>  <br>Because you never know if she's going to heal your soul, murder your dick, drop knowledge bombs, make you laugh, or take you on an emotional roller coaster.</br>  <br><br>Slight preferences are fine as long as you appreciate all forms.<br><br>There exist some Kiss-shot-only or loli-only faggots though and they are not true Shinobu fans though. Everyone else is my friend in great taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looking at this again, the anatomy is all sorts of fucked up.<br><br>She's also the queen of subtle but powerful expressions.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I've never found her scary or intimidating</br></br>  <br>I'm still really glad Sakamoto replaced Hirano. I just can't imagine Hirano doing it just as well</br>  <br>How can you be so fearless in front of this blood lusting vampire that could kill you and feast on your corpse at any given moment, anon?</br>    <br>She's just too cute and good of a person to kill me like that. If she did harm me I probably deserved it.</br>  <br>Yeah. Sakamoto completely nails the part. She's really good at conveying emotions without going into full-on drama mode like you'll see in most anime. Part of that is the source material, but I have to give her credit.</br>  <br>Because she is a master of manipulation and deception. That's how she's stayed alive so long.</br>  <br>That doesn't quite apply until post-Kabuki Shinobu. She's still unstable before then.</br>  <br>Why would anyone want unstable shinobu?</br>  <br>I wish she'd deceive me into buying her donuts</br>  <br>This outfit is disgusting</br>  <br>I've been brought here by humans, who wished to pay me tribute.</br>  <br>So you can give her the love she needs to become the wonderful person she is.</br>  <br>At least she isnt sub-human like the british</br>  <br>Tribute!?! <br><br>You steal men's souls and make them your slaves!</br></br></br>  <br>She's really been trying to stop that. She can't help it though. She just walks near a person and all of a sudden they're sacrificing their life to help her cross a puddle.</br>  <br>They consent. Thats all that matters.</br>  <br>I like your favorites,  Ned </br>  <br>Hoodie &gt; kimono &gt; summer dress &gt; pile of shit in OP's pic</br>  <br> Hoodie &gt; kimono <br>I can't agree with this.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps that could be said of all religions...</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128340250 <br>Can she get fat?</br>  <br>My only complaint is no chara songs</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128340250 <br>Because donuts are fucking delicious obviously you faggot.<br><br>The only thing that Shinobu is doing wrong is that she only eats those donuts with a hole in them. The cream filled ones are the best.</br></br></br>  <br> Complains about donuts that aren't cream-filled <br> Posts Ararararagi cream-filling Shinobu's donut </br></br>  <br> Sundress not at the top <br> Hoodie not at the bottom <br><br>Shit taste confirmed.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Actually it's post Owari Shinobu that is most stable, Kanbaru gives her a Kamijou certified lecture in Shinobu Mail, which is why she seems so pensive lecturing Nadeko on taking advantage of Araragi, because she does too.<br><br>She also doesn't care in Tsuki should he become full vamp, despite how that would ruin his life.<br><br>So no, she hasn't changed much post Kabuki.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I can admit that hoodie doesn't fit on this list since it's not loli Shinobu, choosing bland, generic sundress over kimono with buns is the pinnacle of shit taste.</br>  <br>Loli or not, the hoodie is an abomination. SHAFT really dropped the ball on that design.<br><br>The kimono is pretty and exotic, but you are out of your mind if you think it's even remotely as iconic or sexy as the sundress.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for the NTR doujin of her to end so the artist would start doing Vanilla again</br>  <br>Huh?</br>  <br>They are</br>  <br>I don't understand what's going on in that pic. Araragi's upper chest doesn't fit his abs</br>  <br>Go look up "Netoraregatari"<br>Unless you're Karen-chan, you'd probably pop a vessel from the rage.</br></br>  <br>Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a saviour like you!</br>  <br>I see. I know what your talking about now. I just didn't know what you were referencing at the time. And no thanks.</br>  This is my wallpaper  <br>I enjoy rape and NTR of characters I like, so I really like that series.</br>  <br> Netoraregatari <br><br>Please kill yourself.</br></br></br>  which one and why.  <br>Araragi. Because he's best.</br>  <br>I'll take that fuccboi on the right everyday.</br>  <br>That shit is so out of character I can't even get it up.</br>  <br>It is a nice bike</br>  <br>A bike is fine too.</br>  <br>At least Shinobu looks hot as high hell in those. I guess you do need a gigantic dose of suspension of disbelief tho', alright.</br>  <br>Kaiki's haircut is a boner killer.</br>  <br>You talkin' shit about best girl?</br>  <br>Glad to see shit taste is still a thing of monogatari.</br>  <br>The haughty 10yo with the short hair does things to my blood vessels.</br>  <br>Does the loli in a basket come free with the bike?</br>  <br>So she can reach breeding stock age?<br>Also I have a retarded question, but what is the proper order to watch the monogatari series? I know you start with bakemonogatari, but I am not sure where to go from there and is the source translated and printed somewhere or only available translated on the web?</br></br>  How is this not translated yet? It's Bloody Okojo's first monogatari doujin  <br> what is the proper order to watch the monogatari series? <br>Right now I can't really say there is one. If we could definitely say there won't be any more monogatari produced, then we might be able to come up with canon chronological episodes to watch. But as it is now, there are still wholes in the anime's continuity, so just watch it in the order it aired (Bake -&gt; Nise -&gt; Neko -&gt; Second Season -&gt; Hana -&gt; Tsuki)<br><br>I heard the source material got licensed to be translated, but as of now the only full translations you can find are on Baka-tsuki and I think the only book that's 100% is Kizu</br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, thanks. I saw more monogatari BDs coming out sometime in the future on rightstuf. I think I saw the one with shinobu's arc</br>  <br> I heard the source material got licensed to be translated <br>Kizu is coming out, but I think the rest depend on how that does.</br></br>  Is it ok if I post some  Cat?     Should I know who the four girls in the middle are?  <br>The one to his near left may be Ai Kaga from SZS girls. Araragi is grabbing her around her hips</br>  <br>I thought that too but I've also people tell me I'm wrong. This was about as far as I could deduce</br>  Am I bad person for liking bat and snail...<br>...and bat and snail only?</br>  <br>Yes, all girls deserve the love. Even Cat and Snake.</br>  <br>Meh, not my place to judge.</br>  <br>Crow best girl no discussion</br>  <br>Fuck the bike, I want my Araragi</br>  <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  <br> Snake <br>Woah there buddy let's not be rash, not all girls need to be loved.</br></br>  <br>That's Roy</br>  God damnit I love as109.  not enough love for this glorious version  <br>Snake needs dickings and nothing more.</br>  <br>I don't know why he made it last for so long. Not only was it way too long to finish, it's way too OOC for the characters. Shinobu makes 0 sensical decisions and Araragi is ridiculously beta. All the girls act retarded as well.<br><br>Plus I hate NTR, so that doesn't help.</br></br></br>  <br>why was that allowed?</br>  <br>mein neger</br>  <br> Two people hugging each other and sliding around to get in a comfortable position shouldn't be allowed </br>  Soon.

Of course she calms down and adopts human morality even more over time.<br><br>Her statement in Tsuki can't really be taken at face value because the entire point of it was to stop Araragi from doing something stupid and getting himself killed. I'm sure that, as a worst case scenario, she would be okay with Araragi going full vamp. However, she definitely knows that he would be happiest as a human and wants that for him.</br></br></br>  I just hope Shaft don't fuck up Owari  What happens if Arararararagi lets Shinobu become an adult again?  <br>Then he goes full vamp and becomes her thrall again.</br>  <br>Every adaptation Shaft has made after Season 2 has been shit, so expect shit.</br>  <br>They would fuck even more than they do already.</br>  <br>Assuming he didn't die, that is.</br>  <br>He would die from blood loss.<br><br>And not just because of the blood Shinobu sucked to return to her adult form.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you man Hana was great and Tsuki was an introductory arc. Would have worked better a part of a cour season.</br>  <br>Oh please, I bet he'd like that.  Crab a shit. </br>  <br>Maybe I expressed myself wrong. Hana and Tsuki are not shit. They're just animated like shit if you compare them with any other season. And thank you, but I'll pass about fucking myself.</br>  <br> Hana was great <br>Probably my least favorite, Araragi had a shit design, and there wasn't even any good basketball going on <br> The OP shouldve had crossovers and pivots rather than a fucking half court shot </br></br></br>  <br>Nisekoi is tolerable, which makes it better than the manga. They only really fucked up Mekakucity Actors.</br>  <br>I was talking about Monogataris only, anon. Haven't seen Nisekoi and I only dislike Mekaku's ending.</br>  <br>Mekaku had an amazing OP at least and the songs were fun</br>  <br>I really disliked Nisekoi S2. Felt that it lacked direction, even by Nisekoi's standards. Just a bunch of random plot arcs thrown together. S1 felt like there was a semblance of an over-arching plot.</br>  <br>This. <br>Cat is second best.</br></br>  <br>She returns to her former self. The entity known as Shinobu is a fragment of Kiss-shot. While it's true they're technically the same person the difference is that Kiss-shot is a full blown vampire and a much more extreme oddity. <br><br>If she were to return to full power she'd become much less human than she is now, she'd need to feed on humans again, and she'd likely try to either control Koyomi or kill him and then herself. She knows this too and thats part of the reason why their relationship is so intertwined and why his repeated use of her draining his blood to make him more vampire like and using her regenerative powers has had the effect it did.</br></br></br>  <br> she'd likely try to either control Koyomi or kill him and then herself <br>But she completely retains her personality as Shinobu and wants to do nothing but help Araragi.</br></br>  <br><br>The point of that was that selfishness she has in. Unlike the other girls, she can have him literally whenever she pleases, thus why her talk with Nadeko was retroactively from experience when you read Shinobu Mail. <br><br>She was always lonely, so losing her companion is the one thing she never wants. So like Nadeko, she takes advantage of the fact that he is wholly devoted to her. It's a part of her character, and also part of Araragi's issues.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And to add onto that, so that it doesn't get misunderstood I am calling her a bad person, but pointing out that her problems haven't been completely solved. Hell, the land wasn't stabilized because he refused to make Shinobu a god due to them both valuing their bond.<br><br>Luckily of course for them  Hachikuji ended up getting the job.  </br></br></br></br>   nise commentaries will never be translated   <br>What? They haven't been translated yet? But the SS commentaries have!</br>  <br>There has only been one SS commentary translated unless I missed something.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but why are the SS commentaries being released before the Nise ones?</br>  <br>One got released because a random guy felt like it. There are no plans for any others.</br>    Shinobu &gt; Mayoi &gt; Twins  <br>I can get behind this.</br>  <br>And I say that with all my love</br>  <br>If she returned to being Kiss-shot then Araragi wouldn't want to deal. Thats the entire fucking point of the end of Kizu is caused by him not wanting to be a vampire and his moral issues with Kiss-shot.</br>  <br>And the entire point of Owari is that they've accepted each other.</br>  <br>Except she isn't a goof, she wanted to kill and still wants to kill the conman for stealing from her and breaking up her family. She wanted to make it better or at least not suffer as much. Unless you believe a conmans word.</br>  <br> heartbreaking slut <br>More like SJW Cuck</br></br>  <br>You don't fuck the lolis you sick fucks you give head pats.</br>  <br>So find and make sure to purchase it to help the hope for more?

It's disappointing how much rewriting they are doing to the story.

I get that they were supposed to be fun, but they are really not. There are like 2 or 3 chapters based mainly on them, and fuck me, those chapters are boring as hell. <br><br>I don't understand why would they even adapt fuku-chan in the anime, and they even rushed to show him in episode 3?

Like, really fucking bad. Dumpire looked more manly than JoJo.</br>  it seems like the season will be halfway over before we introduce all the main characters. We probably won't even get to the big  SUFFERING  chapters.  I'm still really enjoying the way events are rearranged and some elements are introduced earlier or in a different context, it feels very fresh to me, and the pace and flow of events is still great comedic-wise and storytelling-wise. They captured the essence of Mikan's character very nicely, and though it didn't feel as rewarding, if that's the right word, as it did originally, they still left a lot of room for development on her side, and she's still hilarious, so nothing's really lost.<br>The truth is that there's the slight feeling that I really wanted to see some of the manga scenes accurately adapted, but I'm not coming from a place that thinks that the changes are bad, since I honestly don't, it's just that some of the scenes from the manga were so great. Now it's the adaptation's time to shine though, up until now I've thoroughly enjoyed each episode, I'm also loving adapted Shiragami more and more with every passing week, and I'm looking forward for what's to come.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128349097 <br>3DPD shitter please go.<br><br>Also why do you care what MAL and Reddit do?</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to reddit if you want some sort of hugbox.</br>    <br>So now we're pretending that Japanese BD-sales are base upon the posting habits of 4chan /a/?<br><br>Anon, just stop posting please.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, posting that now is a suicide.

I thought that word was dead.</br>  <br>Searching for your glasses because they talk makes more sense than searching for them because it was a gift from your crush?<br><br>Not in my chinese cartoons anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw pwned on  /sp/  today, I didn't knew it was still used.</br>  <br>No, searching your glasses that talk and they were a gift for your crush makes more sense that just glassed from your crush.</br>  <br><br>Look there </br></br>  <br>Obviously they'll have to change that, but my point is that that's the only part they have to change.</br>  <br>As we saw in today's episode, the animators really hate Orange, so they probably won't bother adapting the whole story about her searching for glasses.</br>   inb4 they turn Dumpire ito a slut in the anime. <br><br>  By having her suck Asahi's blood in the last episode. </br></br>  <br>it won't have feel. <br><br><br>She became relevant with the box girl</br></br></br></br>  <br> it won't have feel.  <br><br>it won't have the same feel but it will probably look okay.</br></br></br>  <br>You sick bastard.</br>  <br>I bet they merge the Amusement Park trips so we get a kiss in the last episode</br>  <br>which manga?</br>  <br>Redline</br>  <br> That also happens in the manga the same week. <br><br>It will happen, she wants the B badly.</br></br></br>  <br>seriously.</br>  <br>Are they pronouncing her nickname as "GhettoQueen"?</br>  Why dumon get a nosebleed during the last released chapter?  <br>I'll admit I chuckled.</br>  <br>This is garbage</br>  <br>Because she's a cool beauty. <br><br> and a slut <br><br> flap flap </br></br></br></br></br>  Did anyone got LoTR reference?  <br>They both did because they both fell on their fucking faces</br>  <br>KEK</br>  <br>10/2=7 nois math m8<br> &gt;&gt;/MAL/ </br></br>  Manga &gt; Anime sofar  This episode was really bad  <br>Does anybody else want to see a horror manga by the same author?</br>  <br>Anime &gt; manga sofar</br>    <br>What was there?</br>   Orange voice <br>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK<br>All those "manga voices" memes aside, it doesn't suit her at all.</br></br>  <br><br>Here from the same author: <br><br>Chapter 01 RAW : http://arc.akitashoten.co.jp/comics<wbr>/toumei/1<br><br>related pic</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for the part where she turns from worst girl to being one of the best.</br>  <br>Mikan is mandarin. Orange is Tachibana.</br>  <br>There is a part like that? I must have missed it</br>  <br>uwow uwow</br>  <br> Can't wait for the part where she turns from worst girl to being one of the best <br> "Right guys?" <br><br><br> "Right...?" <br><br>It doesn't exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Owww the edge. Still thank you nice anon I love your cock</br>  Anyone also bothered Crunchy's use of the word "heathen" for Mikan? I thought "Evil" worked a lot better  <br>dunno, but since the anime is shit, no one care. Go read the manga.</br>  <br>They're are saying "heathen queen" in engrish, so it's the correct translation, but yes, I also prefer "evil queen"</br>  <br>I think 外道 is best translated as "scumbag," but evil works fine too.<br><br>"Heathen" is a really weird way to translate it, and it really doesn't make sense in context.</br></br></br>  Looks like I'll finally have to learn moon. <br><br>Since we're like 8 months behind the elevens with translations, even if Pretty Anon team would work their asses off, we won't catch up for another year or so, and that's assuming they won't drop it. Time to bookmard DJT, I guess.</br></br>  <br>The scanlators have already said that they have no intention of catching up with the manga because they prefer to work with the tankobons. With that said, something like JitsuWata should be fairly easy for a beginner to read.</br>  <br>It's a weekly manga and we're getting translations once a week, so we'll never really catch up</br>  <br> DJT <br>what is that?</br></br>  <br>http://jisho.org/search/%E5%A4%96%E<wbr>9%81%93<br><br>Seems like a fine translation.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Daily Japanese Thread</br>  <br><br>Well, if that's not a reason to learn moon, then I don't know what is.</br></br>  <br><br>We might catch up after it's completed. Which means another 3+ years, and that's assuming translators won't drop it in the meantime. <br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this meme</br>   fuku-chan's VA is female <br>I always imagined fuku to be male, am I the only one?</br>  <br> fuku-chan </br>  <br>you're not...</br>  <br>No, you're not. Now I find this moment even more funny</br>  <br>I still think he's male. But that VA is new, right? She sounded like Hirano Aya, particularly her role as PaiPai in Gatchaman.</br>  <br>They still call him "god" so he's male, but with a feminine voice.</br>  <br>I always thought that fuku was male, but his voice changed based on who was holding him. (Which sort of explains Alium).</br>  <br>I forgot how unlikeable she was in the beginning. <br><br>It's weird how cool she is now</br></br></br>  <br>Orange a cute</br>  <br>Well, it explains why Fuku is so dumb.</br>  What is it with anime and their school papers being awful Murdoch-tier tabloid trash?  <br>No one would read the school paper if it wasn't. Why would anyone bother with the school paper in the first place</br>  FUCK ORANGE<br>FUCK GREEN<br>FUCK YELLOW<br><br>BLUE FOR LYFE</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I did school paper, it was mostly an excuse to laze around and write stupid shit and load it up with in-jokes and secret messages.</br>  <br>BLUE FOR LIFE<br>L<br>U<br>E<br><br>F<br>O<br>R<br><br>L<br>I<br>F<br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's useful for those who write it to get practice but no one bothers to read it</br>  Holy shit this is the first time I hate a childhood friend from the moment she's introduced, even Minami was okay for me at first because her design hit all of my weaknesses and she wasn't all that bad until she went full moralfag.<br>And don't worry mangafags, I promise I'll pick the manga up once I stop being so lazy.</br>  <br>Then you're ahead of the game, everyone but orangefags recognize her as worst girl.</br>  <br>Secondaries really are cancerous.</br>  <br>She turned from worst girl into still worst girl, but much much better.<br><br>The competition she has to deal with though ensures she is still worst.</br></br></br>  *flapflapflap*  <br>The episodes felt really bad though. It was mostly<br> Orange Classroom - the anime </br></br>  <br>They wanted to get the girl that is most popular, and probably best, in the picture as soon as possible.<br><br>A bit cynical, but understandable. It's like what they do with Meat in Haganai anime.</br></br></br>   Sakurada blushing   <br>His opinion on Orange mirrors the primaries though since she is really awful.</br>  <br>They also took out Oka being on the roof with Asahi</br>  <br><br> People liking Alium </br></br>  <br>And just think, the anime won't get far enough for her to stop being horrible.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if they speed up her development somehow to get her out of her awful phase since this is never getting a second season.<br>They can only do so much without Granddumber though, since Orange really depends on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I figured Fuku-chan was a male but hoped he would be a female since it wasn't really clear early on.<br>Then the chapter came with the Love Hotel and I figured that confirmed Fuku-chan to be male.</br></br>  <br>All characters got a lot better once their personalities got established past a simple gimmick.</br>  <br>the nigger-spam in the captcha gets me every time</br>  <br>I need to impregnate her external unit.</br>  <br>Just finished the episode.

It was better in this episode than the first</br>  <br>Mikan makes the best faces.</br>  I dropped the manga because the anime art is really good.<br><br>Thank God.</br></br>  <br>holy shit whats her problem? nearly dropped this show because her. worst girl so far</br>  Mikan was as hate-able as I can remember. So far so good.  <br><br>When you're that transparent, it takes all the fun out of it.</br></br>  holy shit.

Please someone tell me i'm not alone</br>  <br> what's the point of this series at all <br><br>Either Cute Girls doing Dumb Things, or Dumb Girls doing Cute Things.</br></br></br>  <br>I understand where you are coming from but I strongly disagree, Orange is clearly worst girl.<br><br>You are not too far off about the boring thing. Her biggest traits are that she is cute and dumb, which most of the girls are. I think the bigger issue is that she is almost always seen from the perspective of someone else rather than her own, so she gets less development that way. She's also Main Girl so hard that it hampers her own development, in the same way Haruna of TLR is.<br><br>All that said, she's still second best girl in my opinion, but probably not the second best character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Orange is clearly worst girl. <br><br>She isn't, all girl are good and best girl </br></br></br>  <br>All girls eventually become good, yes, but even when they are all best, some are more best than others.</br>  <br>I loved Mikan in the manga but I hate her in the anime.

Go back to tumblr.</br></br>  <br>Remove Shirou and Illya from her route. Like, completely. Don't even acknowledge their existence. And have Rin die early on. Leave it to Shinji, Kotomine, and Zouken to sort things out. Or even better, let Sakura be the one who fixes shit.</br>  <br>Nothing really. I like her now <br><br>Rinfags will never stop won't they?</br></br></br>  <br> Tragic backstory without being used goods. <br> Strong and independent. <br> No worms. <br> Endearing personality. <br> Doesn't fake feelings of affection. <br> Wormless. <br> Shorter. <br> Flatter. <br> Younger looking in general. <br> Lacking in worms. <br> Give her white hair. <br> Red eyes. <br> Two equally great side characters that come with her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> take away the rape thing <br> cut her skirt down to a quarter of its current length and give her ZR <br> give her twintails <br> make her another shitty generic Asuka-clone like her sister <br> Rake in grubby semen-encrusted otaku monies. <br>You asked how to make her popular. Not how to make her good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating cooking scenes <br>I bet you like this boring shit. <br><br> still no Fate cooking wars </br></br></br></br>  <br>This ship was weirdly popular when Fate/Zero aired. Probably because some people got the wrongful impression of Kariya fighting for anyone but himself. Anyway, maybe try cashing in on this.</br>  <br>Replace her sensible-length skirt with one that doesn't even cover her ass fully and flash blue-striped panties 50 times per scene.</br>  <br>More graphic depictions of her in the basement of Casa de Worm.</br>  <br>Honestly I dislike both her regular personality and her Dark Sakura personality, and her backstory and role in HF was so unsympathetic to me that I thought killing her would be the true end when I first read it. So I don't know, the only way to fix her would be to change her completely.</br>  Why would I want Sakura to be that popular?<br><br>As it stands, I can safely ignore Sakura haters' posts and lose nothing of value. It's an excellent filter.</br></br>  <br>People liked loli Sakura. Maybe make her a loli again? Might not work since FSN already has one token loli, but that one is old and busted and sucks anyway.</br>  Should have gone with the older sister.   Show the development between her and Shirou <br> Don't make her an antagonist in her own route <br> Stop trying to make her sympathetic while everyone else gets fucked over cause of her <br> Have her actually help Shirou besides cooking for him, considering the guy gave up everything for her <br> Stop having her say "Senpai" so much <br><br>Honestly we'd be better off with just starting a new character from scratch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> popular <br>Why in God's name would you want that? The popular girl is always the most generic cardboard cutout designed to pander to the largest audience.</br></br>  <br>Make her a dude. Everything would be better if Sakura was a guy.</br>  <br>The Tohsaka sisters love that shit. See how Rin goes full dere during sex.</br>  <br><br> act <br><br>That was genuine. See her dictionary entry. She just also happens to rarely have times of extreme bluntness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Sakura goes full slut during her ero scenes, but hardly hints at it otherwise. Rin at least has lots of cute dere moments outside the bedroom.</br>  <br>It's just Nasu who was dedicated to writing reversals for almost every character in FSN. It's all just, "This way it looks completely generic, right? Well, surprise, it's actually the other way!"</br>  <br>Make her so that she was dead before she was conceived.</br>  <br>Simple. Just convince Zouken to adopt right sister.</br>  Sakura is perfect the way she is. She doesn't need to change.  <br>Can you cowtitfags please kill yourselves?<br><br>Stop RUINING perfect bodies with your shit tier pleb taste.</br></br></br>  <br>they're literally the perfect size wtf, do you know what cowtits are</br>  <br>But dude, Sakura is actual cowtits? Officialy confirmed.</br>  <br>Calm down.</br>  <br><br>She was a person in actual trouble and a magical experiment, if you can't feel for that, you have to just admit you are a bit of an asshole. It's fine not being able to relate, but try to widen your perspective.<br><br>Ilya always heartlessly sics a mountain of muscle on Shirou from the start, and could have solved a bunch of problems early on by divulging important info about the grail system, yet people have no issue with her having a route. So arguing the antagonist angle is hypocrisy at its finest. It was hardly just on Sakura that things got fucked up in HF. Or are you really going to blame someone for having their soul and body linked to All the World's Evil against their will? <br><br>Sakura does help Shirou to her detriment a couple times, and gave every dime she had getting him a new body, what are you smoking saying she hasn't done anything for him?<br><br>If you are going to argue that she needs character inprovements, maybe first you could understand her character? That would be helpful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura has always had ridiculous cowtits. Rin is the Heroine of Balance.</br>  <br><br>As expected of flatfags. I don't have a problem with attraction androgyny, but please don't take out your closeted frustrations on people who have an attraction to actual feminine features.</br></br>  <br>Smaller body, white hair, name changed to Ilya.</br>  <br>That sounds gr-WAIT A SECOND</br>  <br>Don't forget giving her Ilya's personality. Ilya with Sakura's personality would still be a shit.</br>  <br> wanting a pedophile route </br>  <br>She's 85cm. I don't know the official designation, but cowtits was always 100cm and up to me.</br>  <br>Not just dere, but in Hollow Ataraxia she becomes completely broken and even develop blank eyes as Sakura.<br><br>Even broken Rin is still pretty lovely.</br></br></br>  <br> take away the rape thing <br><br>Oh god please, that thing was fucking retarded. I cringed through the whole route because of the whole sex worms plot.</br></br></br>  Oh boy, another Rinfag bashing Sakura topic. I'm not even that big a fan of her(Illya&gt;Seiba&gt;Rin&gt;Rider&gt;Bazett&gt;Sa<wbr>kura&gt;Caster&gt;Taiga&gt;Caren) but these topic are obnoxious and add nothing. Can't you two just get along? The characters did.</wbr>  <br> silly, bitchy, smug <br>She mostly like that with Shirou because he's the one she is most comfortable around. It just isn't as overt so people don't tend to notice in all the chatter. That and romantic development in HF is different from the others.</br></br>  <br>Sakura is confirmed E-cup.</br>  <br>Aren't the majority of her scenes like that anyway? There's more "what Sakura is being really pushy" than there is anything else about her in the VN and Hollow is nothing but that.</br>  <br>85E. That's what Taiga said. Jap E-cup is American D-cup.</br>  <br><br>If by slut you mean actually acts like she enjoys being with the one she loves instead of standard "shy maiden #999 broken into pleasure by the MC" then yeah.<br><br>Her seeing he was tired one scene and just giving him some extra service with a bj was pretty realistic given her personality of being empathetic and attentive.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, it was many time hinted that if Sakura wasn't raised by Matous and raped since childhood. Her personality would by pretty much milder version of Luvia.<br>Would you want that?</br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but Luvia is 2rude.</br>  <br>Rin gived Shirou full-blow deepthroat in Eclipse.</br>  <br><br>Wrong. Her tits are normal and not as big as the silicone abominations in the pic.</br></br>  <br><br>It's easier if you translate it to American bra size. Look up 38DD breasts on google, and you are close to what she should have. It's pretty huge.</br></br>  <br> Mild Luvia <br>That's exactly what I want from her, so yes</br></br>  <br>Of course, Luvia a best.</br>  <br>looks like a good deal if her voice can give me boners like that</br>  <br>Have you seen Ufotable version?</br>  Sakura was raped, while TOHSAKA RIN PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY.<br><br>I think we can tell which sister is more virtuous.</br></br>    <br><br>For some reason I have the feeling that Sakura and Luvia would actually get along.</br></br>  <br>i want to rape you luvia</br>  <br>No rape. Make her less Jealous. Some people may still not like her but they just want that 1st heroine they see anyway.</br>  <br>Butthurt Rinfag on board.</br>  <br>Luvia<br> finds a hobo loli <br> gives her food and shelter <br> formally adopts her <br> gives her the family name <br> offers kind and supporting words <br> gives her buckets of Prismabucks <br> buys her stuff <br> puts her in a school where she can make friends and be a kid <br><br>Rin<br> just short of threatens a 10-year-old albino loli into fighting magical monsters to the death <br> breaks the loli bedroom window <br> physically assaults her employer who gave her a job in her time of need despite Rin having verbally abused her in the past </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Luvia thinks she's a cursed burglar cat.</br>  change her seiyuu, or tell her to stop being so fucking breathy all the time it's annoying as shit  <br><br>Sakura also has a banging ass and curves, with that wild but silken hair. Not that Rin is bad, she has excellent legs and gorgeous curly hair.<br><br>Look at Aoi, it's good stock, plus Finnish touch with that Edelfelt blood. You can say what you want about the sisters, but deep in one's heart, they would have to admit they are both hot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luvia is a demon.</br>  <br>Simply get her out of Zouken influence and she will be like that.</br>    <br>I never said I couldn't feel for it, but she's not the only character to have a shitty past, but unlike the others she just waits around for someone to save her. What you said about it not just being on her is correct, but that doesn't mean it's still not her fault to a degree. She became conscious of her and the shadows killings, yet continued anyway. She also could've solved a lot of the problems in the story by letting Shirou kill her, but she didn't want to die, which is understandable, but at the same time, you have to look at what the cost of that is. Like I said, she doesn't feel any regret over the killings until Rin is finally nice to her, only then does she try to stop All Evils of the World from coming out. Also, it was for her that Shirou lost his body in the first place, and Rin was also helping.<br><br>I can see the angle people come from when they defend Sakura and whatnot, and while she does have a tragic past, that doesn't excuse everything that happens in Heaven's Feel.</br></br></br>  <br><br> doesn't feel any regret over the killings <br><br>She didn't even know it was connected to her until day 12, and the game even says in her final battle with Rin she was putting on a facade due to being cornered emotionally. Look at the second nightmare, she freaked the fuck out at even thinking she had someone's blood on her hands. And she cried over Shinji. SHINJI.<br><br>Seriously. I don't mean to be rude, but this selective memory of the route is a terrible thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"The Tohsaka family that threw me away. Nee-san, who lived without any troubles. My scary grandfather and my pitiful brother. The people living peacefully without knowing about my pain. I can't allow such things now.<br>…I know I'm just taking my anger out on others. I know it's wrong, but I still think this way.<br>Yes.<br>I wonder what kind of face the people who haven't helped me will make when they realize I exist."<br><br>"I said there's no need to hide it.<br>You are not another personality. You were swallowed by the mud and have become addicted to violence, but you are still Matou Sakura. You don't need to prepare another personality to excuse yourself. Her face stiffens. He's absolutely right."<br><br>She knows her thoughts are wrong, and she is aware of it all being connected to her at this point, she accepts that this isn't some alternate personality, and she still plans to go through with this anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura  <br> ass <br>no<br> Rin <br> Curly hair <br>no</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was already been proved in HF that Rin isn't capable on enduring what Sakura did.</br>  <br>It wasn't. Nothing actually proves this, it's just fanfiction.</br>  <br> ass <br> no <br>Ass, yes. Her whole body is slamming.</br></br></br>  <br>She is mostly breasts.</br>  <br>Check out BB's ass. She has the same measurements. She puts Rin to shame.</br>  <br>They are the assets most noted, yes.</br>  <br>They all have nice asses dumbass it's 2D. The traits highlight in-universe or author for Sakura and Rin is the point.</br>  <br> She puts Rin to shame. <br>Of course, it's practically memeshit.</br></br>  Replace her  <br>More mollusks. Everything is better with more mollusks</br>  <br>I think it's really Sakurafags just baiting at this point. Pretty sad but report and ignore.</br>   mind broken loli <br> rape by old man <br> rape by onii-chan <br> bug rape <br>stop going through my exhentai history</br></br></br></br>  <br>Worms are kinda like mollusks. We can easily get more worms in there.</br>  <br>Rin is mostly thighs.</br>  What is paizuri with Sakura like?  <br>And ass according to Nasu. It's just how it is.</br>  <br> &gt;bug rape <br>Was that the sequel to the one where the guy kidnapped an idol and tortured her with cuts and needles and stuff? You know, where the girl agrees to star in some rough porn which then goes out of control as soon as the guy shows up with the bugs and then laughs about it when they show it in court?</br></br>  <br>MHX has pretty great thighs as well. Too bad translation never</br>  Make it so that the worms manifest themselves as a cute loli who sticks with sakura all the time.<br><br>This loli should be her complete opposite while still being friendly, that is to say she is openly lewd but secretly pure, teasing and cruel at times, extremely outgoing and lazy.<br><br>This kills two birds with one stone. Now people don't consider it as being used goods since the worms are just as cute and you want to fuck them too. And this way you can circumvent her natural submissiveness by having a character that helps go out of her shell.<br><br>Imagine that demon loli that does the coffee stirring thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Rape <br><br>Unless you mean the worms she was never raped. Of course she was raped if you take as canon something that has not been canon since 2006 more or less, such as the eroge.<br><br>But I guess some people prefer headcanons, what else would I expect from /a/ shitposting general second only to /v/ and /b/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course I mean the fucking worms.</br>  <br>She is not a virgin in F/Z. She was raped by Zouken who is also the worms. Realta Nua doesn't mention anything on her not being raped by worms in fact it implies that she was.</br>  Make her not shit, so basically change everything about her.  <br>Just cyclet stuff</br>  Less worms<br>Fiercer emotions</br>  I just hated reading "Her mollusk expands, trickling love juice onto my lap" at the end of each day.  <br>Did we ever find out who this mysterious character was?</br>  <br>It's a mystery along with the identity to the elusive Kaleido Ruby.</br>  Sakura is cute! CUTE!<br><br>Staff~ Staff~</br></br>  <br> Gentlemen of fine taste spotted <br>I'd buy you a beer for not being one with the rest of the bandwagoning giant-tit-loving fags.</br></br>  <br>Worm~ Worm~</br>  <br>Kirei is technically correct because Dark Sakura is really just Sakura with her negative emotions amplified by All the Evil's and addicted to that sweet power, but remember that this is Kirei talking so there's always a self-serving motive behind it. Kirei would love for Sakura to embrace this evil as if it were simply natural to do those things, instead of separating herself into weak ordinary Sakura and strong evil Sakura. <br><br>Sakura knew what she was doing was wrong but couldn't deny her feelings anymore. That's what she has been doing to the whole time: keeping them locked up, resigning herself to fate. In a moment of weakness, she realized she didn't have to put up with this anymore and let loose and fucked the world that had fucked over her and neglected her. It's petty and selfish but reason and morality alone can't simply erase everything that's happened and how you feel.<br><br>It's not so much that Sakura turned because Rin was nice to her but that after doing the hard way what they should have done from the getgo, Rin forsook her duties and let Sakura know she did love her and she went through hardship as welll. <br><br>HF is about everyone being selfish, really. At least Sakura wants to do something instead of going mission accomplished.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/feg/ pls go</br>  <br>under rated post</br>  <br> gentlemen of fine taste <br>You're just losers trying to boost your self-esteem by being special snowflakes.

Missing out on part of what makes her an adorable and sexy kouhai.</br>  <br><br>That is simplifying it too greatly, and acting as if AM was on the level of the common cold in how it affected her. Did people forget she lost her human functions as rapidly as Iri did without the help of Avalon or any Einzbern sigils, along with a curse that fucks up the spirit of Servants and humans alike?<br><br>She had bitterness and all, but that conversation with Kirei in the forest was 90% hot air to cope with what had transpired, and her shame and grief overtaking her, and 10% frustration. Her final battle with Rin, once she vented, was just, "why did things happen this way?". And the reason we have so many nervous breakdowns is because of the mentality of dealing with trauma like that is, "eh, shit happens." Which is the worst attitude to have.<br><br>Basically, it is like saying someone who beat the shit out of an asshole who pissed on his mother's corpse at a funeral was always a violent person. Further, not accepting that Rin fucked up the chances for her and Sakura to reconcile until the very end, when Sakura was the first to actual try to repair their relationship, misses the point that BOTH sisters had flaws and exacerbated things to an extent. Add to that a tense situation of the magnitude in the route, more dirty laundry and skeletons in the closet than a locker room, and it ended up the way it did.<br><br>That is not discounting that Sakura did make errors in judgement, but it's not like AM was just some equivalent of alcohol induced anger. Nor was this her "true self", because at the end of the day, she did care, otherwise she wouldn't have taken the job as Supervisor or bothered to help restore the city post route. People who just wanted to kill everyone wouldn't freak out at their hands being covered with blood, or like I told that other guy, be so broken up from taking out a guy who was trying to humiliate and rape her. <br><br>It's why I say she is really misunderstood as a character, not noting the positive, and over blowing flaws.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is only behind Ciel by one centimeter, so it's true. Sakura actually has junk in the trunk. <br><br>Nasu even mentions in her bio that she is secretly a maneater like Jinan Tokie. He literally calls her a devilish woman with a maternal instinct, if you can imagine such a thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How many times did you read to reach such a level of understanding?</br>  <br> implying literally drowning in   disporportional as fuck  boobs is as enjoyable as ones that fight slightly and fail to squeeze past your fingers<br><br>It's like you don't even fuck girls.</br></br></br>  fuck you greentext  <br>Except Archer and Kirei noted that she's only pretending.

If we understand them, we'd be sociopaths.</br>  <br>But would she be more popular?</br>  So in HF, Shirou becomes a yandere?  <br>less people would hate her. you're puuling a shirou, dude.</br>  <br>No, Sakura is a yandere.</br>  <br>Yes, but would she be more popular? If she becomes a non-character, she would just go even further down in the polls. She needs to make top three to know that what we've done here meant something. Everyone must love Sakura!</br>  <br>she'd become a character like luvia, bazett, and taiga instead of a character who's universally despised.</br>  <br>That doesn't sound so bad.<br><br>What exactly would Sakura do to Shirou as a maneater?</br></br></br>  <br>But why is she despised? Is it because there's a rivalry between Rin and Sakura that carries over to their fans? I haven't been part of this fandom for too long, so I don't quite know the history behind people's hatred for Sakura.

The's the typical submissive waif neets obsess over.</br>  Switch things around so that Tokiomi's daughters end up as Tohsaka Sakura and Matou Rin.  <br> Sakura <br> submissive waifu <br>Vanilla is the coating.</br></br></br>   Make Kariya Oji-san survive 4th HGW and become certified badass Makiri magus by 5th HGW start. <br> Fake his death and learn magic by stole Makiri's extensive knowledge. <br> He summon Lancelot again in 5th HGW then use him and utilize worm properly.

Mutual destruction but Kariya still manage to save Rin with cost of his life. <br> Died satisfied and pray for sisters' reconciliation. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My question that causes my soul to waver and wonder is , who are you quoting? </br>  Replace her with Rin.  <br>And even in HF we see nothing but the coating.

At least that's what all you Sakurafags are quick to say whenever she gets criticised for senseless murder </br></br>  <br>Not me, just calling bullshit when I see it.

The fact that she kill Akiha in one of the ending makes her easily the worst Tsukihime.</br>  <br> But why is she despised? <br>She isn't though, she's routinely one of the highest ranking TM characters in the polls.</br></br>  <br><br>That's the EMIYA route.</br></br>  So this guy is, what, a dimension hopper? does that mean the one in different routes and kaleid and etc are all the same guy?  <br>he'd written 2 better Sakuras</br>  <br> &gt;Tragic backstory without being used goods. <br>Dropped here, fuck you purefag.</br></br>  <br>Loses to Iskandet<br>Loses to Arc</br></br>  <br>Can't fault her for losing to Arc, though. She's best Type Moon.</br>  Why do people keep saying realta nua overtakes the original eroge? in canon? is there a statement from the creators?  <br>It doesn't. At most RN is on equal footing to that uncensored version.</br>  <br> best <br>Even Rin beats Arc</br></br>  <br>Well Rin is the best.</br>  <br><br>But Shiki beats Rin.</br></br>  <br>Well Shiki is the best.</br>  <br><br>Arc, Saber, and Shiki are the big three of TM, saying Arc beats Sakura like it's something incredibly significant underestimates Arc. Also the poll still shows that Sakura is very far from being despised.</br></br>  <br>She got beaten by bara bait.</br>  <br> Arc <br>Replace that with Rin. <br>The New Big three is <br>Saber<br>Shiki <br>Rin</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Chibichuki guy definitely thinks Rin's main girl material.</br>  Is she just blond Ilya?<br><br> Type Venus </br></br>  <br>Popularity wise maybe, but she plays second fiddle to the Mushroom and Mr. Sameface.</br>  <br><br>we're get it. you're gay</br></br>  <br> she plays second fiddle to the Mushroom <br><br> This question is for Mr. Kinoko and Takashi: Out of all the Fate characters, who would you want as a bride? (Without worrying about gender) &lt;Ritsuka&gt; <br><br> Nasu: Rin has been at the top of my list for the last ten years, since she could totally lead such a lost cause as myself. But now, as useless as I am, I would plot to make Kitsune my someone special. <br><br> Takeuchi: With a thought like that you really are hopeless. <br><br> Nasu: And what about you? Probably Saber, right? <br><br> Takeuchi: It’s because she's a glimmering star just out of reach that she's beautiful. I couldn't call her my bride. Though for some reason I think Shielder from Grand Order would be the ideal bride. <br><br> Nasu: Really? No kidding (smirks). I guess you can look forward to the next volume of Grand Order! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so she would be nearly as popular as the other two heroines? <br>Wait until the HF movies and further into the HF manga.<br><br>Why do you people care about popularity anyway? Some people are going to like her and some aren't, I like my Sakura the way she is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> rin <br> shielder <br> ubw interview <br> fgo being release in july <br>You're not tricking me into giving you money</br></br></br></br></br>  So is the archer we see in F/SN a clone or not like the others or is he like saber in the he is the original?    <br><br><br>Tits have levels you autists. It's not one or the other. The is such a thing as the perfect balanced tits that are not disgusting oversize cowtits, but not too small.<br><br>But whatever, I'm an assman anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isnt it time to prep the bull for your wife, you cuckold?</br>  <br>loving someone despite the fact that they were raped doesn't make you a cuck.</br>  <br>The answers lie in the visual novel, my friend, specifically the UBW route.</br>  <br>Copy, the real EMIYA is stuck in the janitorial closet and forever doomed to be incapable to reach peace with himself.</br>  <br>He wants to change the fact that she was raped and you dont want that and insult him.<br>That means you like the fact that your waifu was raped and that makes you a cuckold.</br></br>  <br>The anime seems to have dropped that little plot element.</br>  <br> character was raped <br> cuck </br></br>  <br> doesnt want to change the backstory <br> likes the fact that she was raped <br> not cuck </br></br></br>  <br>Nasu went over the fact that he wanted the UBW anime to stand on its own. That's why he wrote the extended epilogue which was supposed to give proper closure to the route. He went on about how the original ending to UBW was hampered down a bit due to the fact that the player was supposed to move onto HF afterward.<br><br>I think the whole "he'll forget this" thing was added to account for that. You head to the next route, and Archer's character is essentially reset. With the anime, which just has a beginning and an ending, that whole thing isn't needed.</br></br></br>  <br>What is the reason for changing it in the first place? I don't think anyone enjoys that she was raped but, why get rid of it? To preserve some her virginity or some shit like that? Seems like a stupid reason.</br>  <br> changing her backstory to something tragic, just not rape <br> appeasing autist who care about purity <br>Congratulations she's still going to be miserable, but atleast she's a virgin.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the first guy and Sakura isn't my waifu, Manaka is. That being said, I probably wouldn't change the rape backstory as it's literally one of the only things that makes her mental breakdown and decent into madness even remotely acceptable the same goes for Kohaku and Fujino. There is nothing besides their histories of brutal sexual assault that could possible justify the actions they take and removing it from their histories just to make them more palatable a few is incredibly stupid.</br>  <br><br> Sakura with cowtits </br></br>  <br><br>lovely</br></br>  <br>they're pretty big in the manga</br>    <br>Seeing this just makes you realise how much dick worms ruin the story. They coul dhave easily gone with more believeable experiments.</br>  <br><br>She's always been the most busty of the main Heroines.</br></br>  Sakura was always SUPPOSED to have cowtits, it's just Takeuchi didn't know how to draw tits in a uniform worth a damn. her chest is closer to what it's supposed to be in the h-scenes when they're free  <br><br>Well the problem is that people just dumb it down to "rape", but it was body modification and experimentation. We got accounts from the girl herself that Zouken poisoned her, changed her very magical nature and all that, something that would kill most people or shorten their lives to a fraction of what it should be. And she survived, and tries to smile to the point most people would never know. If you end up a tortured lab rat for a decade, most people would be strung out completely or catatonic.<br><br>Well, now that the HF manga shows more of her perspective, maybe it will help show that. The next chapter is the night Zouken tries to troll her into fighting in the war by saying she can to slaves if she doesn't want to kill masters. Basically a bribe since he knows about Shirou and Rin. That scene was great because it showed how embittered she was, but and so how intelligent she was to understand how full of shit he was trying to make her fight. And she refuses his offer.</br></br></br></br>  Make her less of an annoying "pity me" character. Jesus christ, she was god awful annoying.  <br>These are not cowtits.</br>  <br>Spawning swords out of the nowhere, ancient spirits summoned to fight for a cup that does nothing, King Arthur but as a woman, etc. A pit of magic parasites the drive people insane is hardly outrageous in this series. It more likely you have a problem with them being linked with sex and being phallic shaped.</br>  <br>Considering Archer is summoned in every timeline at the same time, it's safe to assume that EMIYA only gets his answer when UBW Archer fades.</br>  Didn't see a thread.  Why is Erina such a bitch?  Aldinis a qt.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>Get in line.</br>  So what are the dishes in the manga that are worth cooking?<br><br>I already tried Chaliapin Steak Don.

Why hasn't there been Toriko and SnS collaboration manga?  So why did they feel the need to replace Kaarge arc? Why would they just randomly switch arcs, what is a reason?  <br>and it's glorious</br>  <br><br>that's the inevitable truth with generals</br></br>  <br>Because Toriko is literal dogshit. Notice how Tosh loves collaboration work but decided to do it with Isobe Isobee instead of the obvious choice.</br>  <br>They will probably adapt the Karaage Arc in only one episode or something.</br>  <br>I think it's not up to him to call the shots, no? I agree Toriko became officially worst thing ever after Human world but it's kind of hilarious when it would be the obvious choice. Guess Luffy and Goku don't want to be associated with Toriko anymore also.</br>  <br><br>Because collaborations feels pretty forced in general.</br></br>  <br> you will never eat gelato with Aldini bros <br>Why ever live?</br></br>  <br>That fucking gap between Isami's thighs.</br>  <br>Takumi a cute.</br>  Meat best girl.  <br>What the story behind this pic again?</br>  <br>Isami and Takumi go to a maid cafe in the Karaage Arc if I remember correctly.<br> Translations soon. </br></br>   dat deer in headlights look   Is Hayama's dick likely smaller than Soma's since he's Indian while Soma is Japanese?

The Kaarage arc, and Eizan talking shit to Soma are pretty portable. Soma's dad showing up before all the initial elections stuff already screws up several of his lines, but ultimately they can have him hang around as long as they need to to deliver his lines, though the context might need a bit of changing.</br>  <br>The guy who was translating a la carte</br>  <br>Maybe he got held up by something or is finishing the chapter as we speak.

Most females prefer her over the rest because she's "Cute". While true male faggots gets a boner from her because they think she's waifu material. They find her gentleness, kindness, and her random retarded mental breakdown as appealing. I find her personality boring and she's clearly lacking in the body department compare to other girls in her age group.</br>  <br>Her mom has a better body.</br>  <br>True. <br>If faggots want to look at waifu material well they need to look more towards hinako. She has similar designs like megumi but with a much better personality and a waif's body.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>I apologize if I hurt any megumifags feelings.</br>  <br>Different people find different kinds of girls attractive, no need to be so autistic</br>  <br> random retarded mental breakdown <br>this has been explained already but don't let me interrupt your hatefest</br></br>  It doesn't matter if megumi is a good character design or a bad one since we knew from the start that Erina is going to win anyways. The only relevant thing is whether you find Erina's character to be good or not, Megumi is just a highly-visible side character so you can forgive any faults she has.  <br>I did apologize. It's true that people got different tatses. Some being shitier than others.</br>    <br>You're right about that. People finding beaches and shores attractive are disgusting masochists.</br>  <br>Erina can be alright sometime when she's not bitchy. I find her more interesting than megumi but erina still isn't best girl of this series. Right now alice, hisako, and maybe ryouko are better than her.</br>  <br>Ryoko definitely has one of the better bodies in the series, and her personality's alright, but she's right up there with Meat or Kurase as in she might as well not exist at all.</br>  <br>True. Too bad we don't have enough screen time from her. <br>Meat was actually good at the beginning of the series but she has turn to shit as the series progress.</br></br>   King of the Hill x Shokugeki n Souma cross over when   <br>not to mention she's gunning hard for the smokebowl, which she might have already won</br>  <br> wanting to cross over godly sexy-comedic cooking battles with subpar, poorly animated, hickville slice of life about what rednecks consider good morals <br>people like you should not exist, and I hate you for that</br></br>  <br><br>Or maybe because she gets character development in order to overcome her mental hurdles.</br></br>  <br>Still waiting for the "Revenge of the Smoke" arc.</br>  <br>I still think that giganigga copied Smoke's dish to get past the prelims, it's just that he did it cleverly enough that only a few would have been able to tell, including Smoke.</br>  <br>I meant her anxiety random anxiety disorders. It was just recently when she freaked out for nothing when meeting the elite ten while the rest of the first years behaved normal.</br>  <br>Takumi could've enjoyed this already (not with those two girls though) if he so wants.</br>  Why is Shinomiya so popular? It's weird how he always appears with the main cast in all those promotional materials and in the game too.  <br>That could be true but I don't think he has any beef against gigganigga right now if that really happened. I think he wants to be part of the new golden era of the polar star dorm. He is having some kind of jealousy towards megumi and souma since they are ahead of him. Smoke will probably challenge either souma or megumi in the future.</br>  <br> PSD tag team battles <br> winner gets the right to take on Fumio/Isshiki <br> megumi and souma face ibusaki and ryouko <br> unexpectedly, the champs are the buttbros, who party in marui's room </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In that aspect, I think it's the other people who just are abnormal compared to the rest of the school. Not that then elite ten aren't weird to begin with.</br></br>  <br>more like these? I like fanbubbles</br>  <br>I like to think that if buttbros became a single person, they could take on the 1st seat, but their too busy fighting and denying their homolust.</br>  <br>I'm telling you the buttbros will somehow survive expulsions when all said and done. They'll somehow graduate thia hellish high school.</br>  <br> implying them fighting and trying to one up the other isn't what would put thm at that leve </br>  <br>They will have a feat that even jourichou has never accomplished.</br>  <br>I think that's going to be impossible, especially for them. Graduating means you are a top-tier chef in your own right, while for them, they really only do their best work when they work together. If they had to compete alone, which they probably will in their 2nd/3rd years if they get that far, they will be evaluated on their own strengths and their own distinct cooking, not how well they complement each other.</br>  <br>Well the game involved a school trip to Europe. On the other hand, maybe it involves a trip to Europe as an excuse to have him in it.</br>  <br>Yeah anon I was just trolling there.<br>At this point the only first years I see graduating are -<br>Erina<br>Souma<br>Ryou<br>Hayama<br>Alice<br>Hisako<br>Megumi<br>Takumi.<br>This is the Jewels generation so more people will graduate than the usual which is about five.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh?<br><br>What's so weird about it?</br></br></br>  <br>I'll laugh so hard if they off-screen participate in the elections. All they'd have to do is add a couple of entries to the scoreboard and write some original lines, which the staff is more than happy to do as we've seen.</br>  <br>In the manga they clearly didn't participate.<br>They were cheerleaders throughout the elections.</br></br>  Seriously, where is the porn of this.<br><br>I would take even a decently written smut.</br></br>  <br>I wish the author didn't draw men so well.</br>  <br>The author doesn't draw anything.</br>  <br>You know who I mean.

So he blame author for drawing them "too attractive".</br>  <br>only now do i realize that's a reference for the battle between guts and griffith.<br><br>neat.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually he draws the character images alongside the recipes in the tankobons. But that's it.</br>  <br>Yeah, you're right. This shot of the OP makes me think they'll just stick to flag waving and bully bullying.</br>  <br>I would destroy the chinese girl's pussy so bad.</br>  Oh no!<br>I just fapped!</br>  <br> than the usual which is about five <br>Is that an exaggeration or are you serious?</br></br>    <br>Well the school has a less than 10% graduation rate, so it is more than likely an exaggeration, unless there is a sub 1% rate</br>  <br>too bad she's Meat 2.0</br>  <br>She isn't a shitty tsundere</br>  <br>if you can eat the cone, you don't use a spoon<br><br>It's not a rule though, just fucking common sense.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Besides the "one hand will be enough" comment, they also refer to a single digit graduation rate.</br></br></br>  <br>They give you a spoon if you get the big one that costs around 5€ in some ice-cream parlor.</br>  <br>Look at this american</br>  <br>I meant irrelevancy. And take that back.</br>  Erina a shit.  <br>Fujos ship him with Souma, cakes self-insert into Hinako.</br>  <br>so, the graduating class is the 3rd Years in the Elite 10 and maybe a couple of them on the cusp<br><br>I wonder how the 2nd years and 3rd years get filtered down. It seems like shokugekis are a big deal, and I wouldn't be surprised if there are more events like the training camp set up.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Single digit graduates. <br><br>Meat, Isami, Yoshino and everyone that didn't qualify to the best 8 of the election are fucked and will drop out at one point or another, won't they?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The author is gonna have to drop them soon, or they'll get powerleveled so they can make it through the 2nd year,</br>   people forgetting that Yoshino, Ibusaki, Marui and just about everybody in the Polar Star dorm have been highly competitive and contentious and will most likely all graduate as Souma's presence along with all that will carry the Polar Star dorm <br><br>let's be honest not a single one of them is disappearing other than the two bros because their characters haven't been fleshed out at all<br><br>I mean, can you even tell me their names off the top of your head?</br></br></br></br>  who are the pairs elevens make the most  /u/  out of, if at all?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>do it then</br>  <br>Aoki Daigo and Satou Shouji.</br>  <br>What expulsion would be sadder? The PSD or Isami's one?</br>  <br>Ok but you didn't say it the first time because you didn't know it off the top of your head so you looked it up didn't you???</br>  <br>male bodies are drawn so well. i pop a boner during some parts. damn my faggotry.</br>  <br>First of all we don't know if the story will continue after the first year. If it doesn't the destiny of many of those characters can be wrapped up in an epilogue showing how good they're doing despite dropping at their 2nd-3rd year.<br>If the story does continue, then first years and non-elite second will surely will be introduced, so making Yoshino and co drop at some point could give a lot to the story without hurting in the side characters issue.<br><br> I mean, can you even tell me their names off the top of your head? <br>Bicep and Tricep -kun </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Na that old fart erina grandfather will make sure that it's single digit graduation. The guy is fucked up and he enjoy seeing tears from chefs. He'll make sure that isami, ryouko, smoke, houjou, meat, marui, and yuki don't graduate.That old man is the real asura.</br>  <br>Yoshino's by far, I can see Megumi and her crying their eyes out.</br>  It'll be funny as hell if gigganigga graduates while a guy like smoke drops out.  All named characters will graduate. Even Madoka.  Do you think they'll keep to the single digit graduation rate? Will the Jewels generation do a massive as pull and have 10+ or even 20+ graduates?  <br>Someone HAS to be expulsed. I want my drama.</br>  <br>Meat has a chance. She still gets some exposure and she is popular.</br>  <br>If meat has a chance well ryouko, houjou, smoke marui, and isami also do. Each of them are at least meat level or stronger.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised. They tried to push her everywhere.</br>  Hypothetical graduation/dropping predictions?<br><br> Muscle bros. <br>Drop at the end of 1st year.<br><br> Marui, Shun and Ryoko. <br>Drop at 2nd-3rd year. Shun and Ryoko end up working at some restaurant together.<br><br> Yoshino, Isami and Nao. <br>Drop at 3rd year.<br><br> Nikumi, Hojou and Giganigga. <br>Graduate or drop at 3rd year.<br><br> Hisako and Megumi. <br>Graduate.<br><br> Takumi and Alice. <br>Graduate, maybe as Elite10.<br><br> Erina, Akira, Ryo. <br>Graduate as Elite10.<br><br> Soma. <br>Drop by own choice at 3rd year or graduates as Elite10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU</br>  prediction.<br>souma will marry erina.</br>  <br>what are you?<br>Underage?</br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128368489 <br>Was I too pessimistic or too retarded?</br></br>  <br>Nice prediction but I still think that shun or ryouko have a good chance at graduating.</br>  <br>this is a good prediction and i like this prediction and i would like this prediction to happen</br>  <br> Each of them are at least meat level or stronger. <br>I am not talking about current power levels I am talking about how Tosh puts her everywhere. I am expecting her to level up.</br></br>  <br>You were a fucking piece of shti go fucking fuck yourself dumbass</br>  <br>Predict moar.</br>  <br>that is like the most obvious prediction.</br>  <br>I got it!<br> Is that one still running or is it just on the "translations never" shelf? </br></br>  <br>I like this predictions.</br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br>well, I doubt students wager expulsion in shokugeki very often. But the 2nd and 3rd years obviously have their own events. And of course we know there's the final exam to graduate.<br><br><br>First let's see if Don-senpai survives.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun's case is a bit hard to predict, right now he's a struggling underdog, so he either gets tons of development with the help of his waifu, which could be interesting, or he's definitely gonna crash and burn.</br>  <br>that's why it's good. main girl is 99% of the time best girl</br>  <br><br>You were too real. I'd rather just live in ignorance with my flimsy hope for everyone to graduate together.<br><br>If a loser like Konishi can make it this far, I'm sure even the bros will make it through first year.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be great if Souma is the first one to fall in love/realize his feelings but, instead of being constantly nervous and beta, he acts all chill about it, still teasing Erina and constantly getting in her way while still trying to surpass her.</br>  <br>That will not happen.<br>Erina will realize first for us to question "geez, who would Soma choose". I'm really sick of obvious love triangles.</br></br>  Who is the softest girl?  <br/>  <br>See:<br><br><br>Can't decide between Ryouko or Alice.</br></br></br></br>  Erina is the love of my life  <br>She is too good.</br>  <br> souma copying his father <br>hasn't souma been trying not to do this. other than that predictions seem accurate</br></br>  <br>He's been trying to avoid copying his flavor, however traveling for the sake of finding his own sounds plausible.</br>  <br><br>If he does drop out it'll have to be as a 1st seat.</br></br>  <br> I got to the top so there's nothing else for me here. <br><br>The smug would be grandiose.</br></br></br>  Tosh draws some cute lolis you want to protect  <br> Erina's blind spot in her God Tongue is that she can't taste semen <br><br>Delightful.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Aldincest a big thing in the fujo community?</br>  <br>I don't personally find her appealing, but I could see her appeal to someone like Souma, who grew up without a mother figure and would find a measure of that in Megumi.</br>    Smug  <br>Nah, not the big three on the whole. It rips off Naruto and Fairy Tail extensively though. And that's what bothers me so much, it doesn't want to be anything more than a derivative of those two and it's somehow doing well.<br><br>BokuHero, while not the most original manga out there, executes its concept extremely well and twists the tropes just enough to make them interesting to read while ultimately staying true to them. It should be doing way better than Black Clover but it's not.</br></br></br>   tfw we are getting closer and closer to erina actually liking souma <br>It's happening isn't it?</br>  <br>How is BnH not doing better than Black Clover? It tends to place higher in the rankings, and volume sales are right around where Black Clovers were.</br>  <br>The question is whether Souma will like her back.  The answer is yes, but only as a friendly rival. Nao will win. </br>  <br>She reminds me of pic related</br>  <br>Well his dad did say he needs to find somebody he wants to cook for (very strongly hinting he means romantically). Maybe it will end with them hooking up or some shit (after he wrecks the elite 10 of course)</br>  <br>Why are Kubo, Oda and Mashima allowed to draw male nipples and Tosh is not?</br>  why are 99% of SnS doujins fucking rape and blackmail with the use of aphrodisiac.<br><br>with this many pairing you would expect there are more normal doijins.</br></br>  <br> Erina <br> Not Tadokoro. <br> MFW </br></br></br>  <br> Not Kurase </br>  <br> 90% Haremshit and ErinaFags </br>  <br>Tadokoro is far inferior to erina</br>  <br>Erina is not a good tsundere. She still wants him to fail. What kind of friend/partner would want their m8 to fail?<br><br>Whereas we see Tadokoro/Souma support each other all the time. Sharing stories with one another.</br></br></br>  <br>She's quickly becoming dere though, and that's the best part of tsunderes</br>  <br>muh brutha frum anutha mutha</br>  <br>Third most popular homopairing, so I would say yes.  I fucking hate incest, homo or straight </br>  <br>Incest is great, but Aldincest is shit tier</br>  you wouldn't dare close your eyes, would you?  <br>Sorry, I just think love between siblings is very special, polluting it with incest is too much even for me.</br>  <br>I'm still pissed off they skipped the karaage miniarc</br>  <br>They'll get to it next next week,</br>  <br>I guess they're short on time and only have a 24 episode season.</br>  <br>Wasn't it said that their "jewel generation" is specially gifted? You lose Soma's peers, you can't introduce new ones. I doubt Tootsuki allows exchange students. All of them are graduating except one or two for drama purposes.</br>   this thread is still here <br>It's almost two days old.<br><br><br> She still wants him to fail <br>Not anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not doing the entire tournament this year, just the prelims.</br>  <br>Why is he the best character.<br><br>I'd wanna skinship with him, no homo.</br></br></br>  When do manga chapters usually come out?  <br>Source? It shows the moon in the OP</br>  <br>In that case I'm only watching the stagiare arc onward. Tournament arcs are only good at first viewing/reading.</br>  <br>How has it been selling? Good chance of s2?  God I hope so, the anime does some of the hype moments better than the manga, like with the live cooking soufflé </br>  <br>Make sense for most of them, but I think giganigga should be elite 10 in the end<br><br><br> Soma copying his father <br><br>Or better:<br> Soma come back 10 days before graduation of third years(the year when he should be graduated as well) <br> Challenges all of the elite 10 into shokugeki, 1 per day, from tenth to first <br> Win with style <br><br>Could be the best ending ever if carried out well</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like her. Also, I'd prefer to keep her "underrated" so we don't have more of these shitty, unentertaining, humorless waifu wars like we are with Erina and Megumi.</br>  <br>Maybe a flash forward then, like when Megumi was expelled.</br>  <br>That makes sense. I can't see them announcing a s2 for a while, as there isn't enough source material for another 2 cours unless they stretch out the stagiarie arc</br>  <br>Depending on how far this season goes, an S2 could finish just as they show Souma's original dish at Shino's</br>  <br>If they end on prelims they can't get 2 more cours out of the current material</br>  A season 2 would be nothing but tournament and stagiare with the final shot being of leveled-up SouMAN.  <br> First let's see if Don-senpai survives. <br>Dropped. And Nikumi graduates with her unique don at the final exam.</br></br>     watch first episodes of Dragon Ball Super <br> new villain is a god who is obsessed with food <br> destroy planets if he doesn't like the taste of it's cuisine <br>What SnS dish would you give him to save Earth?</br></br></br>  <br> watching Dragonball Super </br>  <br>A bowl of vegemite.<br>I want to die.</br></br>  <br>Nah, he'll go straight for Isshiki<br><br>Then he'll lose but it will be a close fight because of  waifu powerup </br></br></br>    <br> 2015 <br> watching dragonball <br>At least you didnt post naruto gaiden (or whatever the fuck it's called)</br></br></br>  Yeah I dropped this.
