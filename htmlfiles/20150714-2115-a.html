I was wondering maybe she's like the egg eating snake that spits up the egg shell and swallows the innards. Or throw up the digested hard stuff like an owl pellet. Then the cloaca wouldn't have to have solids that could stretch it.<br>I guess she can't do anal or does that count.<br><br>Truly deep biology.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I checked. Apparently, a 1000lb horse says 15-20lb of hay a day(or this could just be the roughage it needs). This translates to 1.5-2% of total body mass. Assuming Cerea consumes more energy-dense foods like carrots and fruits, we can probably knock it back to 1% body mass per day. This translates to about 12lb of carrots and fruits per day.</br>  Reminder: There isn't a better girl than Suu  Hey. Dumping some supernatural shogi manga.

I just played ReBirth1 on the PC for the first time recently. With a good deal of grinding, I clocked in 37 hours.<br><br>Taking away a lot of the unnecessary grinding, it was probably a lot more comparable to your time of 20 hours.

The Gate special forces walked into a trap because they were told to. So they died. The JSDF weren't superhuman, they just killed the unfortunate people who were given a mission that shouldn't have been initiated.</br></br>  <br><br>But operation eagle claw wasn't a bad plan, nothing was wrong with it.</br></br>  <br> But operation eagle claw wasn't a bad plan, nothing was wrong with it. <br>When the mission was falling apart, instead of backing off they doubled-down, until it turned into a full blown crisis.
