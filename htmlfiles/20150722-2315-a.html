Anybody with half a brain knew this was going to happen, because it was mentioned right in the first Etotama-thread. <br><br> Anonymous Fri 10 Apr 2015 06:30:45 &gt;No.123806754  <br> &gt;***,908位/***,868位 (***,138 pt) [*2予約] 15/04/15 えとたま 壱 [Blu-ray] <br> &gt;release next week <br><br> Rip sales </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Full BD dance when  <br>Tomorrow at the earliest, as the last volume is being released now.

That's counting lurkers and people that will just pass by or miss the thread.<br><br>Any news on manga translations?</br></br></br>  Etotama and Pleiades made last season bearable  4me    I miss the cgi of this show.  <br>The cgi was very well done.</br>  <br>AOTS for me</br>  <br>There are a bunch of reasons why Etotama failed, but a big one was that the only way to know what sort of show Etotama was was to watch it. The description and first episode seemed like generic battle harem bullshit.</br>  <br>Fuckin' loved it. Need more. OVAs weren't enough to satisfy me.</br>  <br>Oh god, all my yes.</br>  <br> actually has good CG <br> legitimately entertaining <br> no sales <br>God I fucking hate the Elevens' taste so much.</br></br></br></br>  <br> doujins never <br>I never been this furious in all my life, I would kill my family and go find a job for it.</br></br>  I liked it. I don't know what else to say.   Show flops <br> Years later Etotama's status in Japan changes into "fun anime, probably the first to incorporate actually good CG for a 1-cour series" <br> Sparks discussion on why the show flopped so hard <br> Interest begins to rise <br> Anime now a "vintage anime" 20 years in the future <br> People start collecting the rare merch and the limited BDs slowly running out <br><br> "Woah anon-kun, is that all the BDs for Etotama?" <br> "Yeah, it's highly revered as the benchmark for 3D at its time, probably a huge stepping stone for the 3D anime we have today" <br> "those are super rare, man, that's cool" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was okay. Good girls, fun CG fights, but still felt like wasted potential.  Had Etotama been made into a fighting game what would each character's big-kanji special finishing moves be? Aside from Nya-tan, Mo-tan, and Chu-tan that is.  <br>I fucking wish.</br>  It's great fun, I like it.

Right.  <br>Naturally.</br>  <br>If only she had gotten an episode.</br>  Uriru~    <br><br>That's not bestbest girl.</br></br>  so how's every doing coping in a post Etotama world <br><br>Tiger a best</br></br>  <br>Watching yet another comfy, cute, failing show of the season<br><br> That's not paca </br></br></br>  <br><br>what show?

Plus the music was nice to kick back too</br></br>  <br>Fuck you Ep 1 was  berry  satisfactory</br>  <br><br>I didn't mean to say it was bad, it was just painful because of Futaba's newbie fails.</br></br>  <br> failing show <br>Everything I like is failing.</br></br>  The show was fun, but I can understand why it didn't sell. You only have so much disposable income, and cute comedy shows are in great multitude. It wasn't on anyone's radar, and it didn't do anything spectacular. It won't leave a legacy. It will be fondly remembered from time to time. That's the best it could have done. I, myself, would not buy it despite enjoying it greatly.  <br><br>look no one was expecting the show do be the next big thing. But we'd at least have liked to break even or make a modest profit</br></br>  <br>I'll just keep quiet. I have a rebuttal, but it's a cruel reminder of how the world works.</br>  <br><br>HAH HAH the world is a sad shallow place where true art dies and the people who have the most power are motivated only by greed, sloth and money</br></br>  If we post enough of moot-chan Asuka will come back to us.<br><br>Wait.</br></br>  What do you think of sheep?  <br>The bestest.</br>    <br> You will never be stalked by a cute fluffy sheep </br>  <br>Doesn't sound that tempting actually</br>  <br>but that was acctualy shit in every aspect.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HNM<wbr>q8XS4LhE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Fuck, don't remind me.<br>I'm well aware of it's flaws but I enjoyed it way too much.  fuck the ending though </br></br>  <br>Gotta work to be able to buy the anime you like anon. So that you can support it's creation.<br><br>Just how it works.</br></br></br>  I've never missed a show so much.<br>For me, all the girls were, how can I say, like imperfect, but altogether they made a fucking bunch of characters very likeable.<br><br>Even Rat.</br></br></br>  Did anyone else notice this reference?<br><br> My sides are in orbit. </br></br>  Nope anon, just you.

I guess this makes us brothers.</br>  <br>She's a pure slut.</br>  <br>Rip</br>  <br> My sides are in orbit. <br><br>That being said, how can anyone find this shit funny?<br>The entire 'humor' are either japanese puns you can't translate or dirty jokes only 13 year olds and/or virgins laugh about.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just like the Joker said, "madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little 'push'!"<br><br>She is at the top of the purity level; the ideal yamato nadeshiko. Thus, her fall is larger than any other could have. Her slut levels will be off the charts when she's corrupted.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Just like the Joker said <br>Stopped reading there.<br>Filtered.</br></br></br>  Does Sleepy fall in love with anyone?  <br>She is pure, she loves Tanukichi. Don't listen to those faggots.</br>  <br><br>Wow, good eye</br></br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br> or virgins <br>Where do you think you are faggot?

Most of the show isn't that funny, but it is vaguely entertaining at the least. Worth watching just this season, but will probably be forgettable ultimately.</br>  <br>The purple/white color scheme of the fig on the right's outfit also brings To-Love-Ru to mind.</br>  <br> unironically using virgin as an insult <br> on /a/ <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I loved seeing this pool in Kamen Rider Fourze.</br>  <br>the third one reminds me of Pururin from NHK</br>  <br> quoting the joker <br>You've gotta be at least 18 to post here</br></br>  <br>Thanks. Fuck giving them revenue.</br>    <br>You're the hundredth person to point this out. Everyone gets it, yes.</br>  <br>I didn't get it before Kotaku told me about it.</br>  <br/>    <br><br>I wish there was a list for every video where this pool was used.</br></br>  <br>no?</br>  <br> not knowing the magic mirror truck literally just before that <br><br>pleb</br></br></br>  <br>Is this it? Hardly infamous.</br>  <br> not watching any JAVs <br>Faggot you don't know how many porn videos they used on that pool.</br></br>  <br>Why do people here know more about JAV than about translated Alice games?</br>  <br>i love this show precisely because it's fucking stupid</br>  <br>She's pure with a semen demon locked inside her personality due to repressing shit most likely. Okuma just so happen to unlock that shit when he landed on her.<br><br>You'll see just how "pure" she technically is next episode, I promise.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't because I never watched a JAV</br>  <br>If you watch anime and watch porn you may have seen at LEAST one porno or porn clip including that pool. It wouldn't be too much of an exaggeration that if you swim in that pool you may as well be participating in technical bukkake if they don't clean it as much as they do.<br><br>For them to blow the ever living fuck of it in the show is hilarious and a nice cultural joke honestly. Stupid or not, this show's fucking fun</br></br></br>  <br> You'll see just how "pure" she technically is next episode, I promise. <br>but,anon I want to do with her now ,ah I mean I want to know now.</br></br>  Is he the most based  antagonist  ever?  <br> Antagonist </br>  <br>he is the most based main character.</br>  <br> No, but he is one of the best.</br>  Looked better with glasses. More sinister looking  <br>He should have used his ability in fight with Ichigo as fast as he could, his arrogance fucked him over.</br>  What he even do? I read Bleach a million years ago and forgot almost everything. I remember he turned into feel guy and got blown by Ichigo's usual attack. Did he even have any motivation for doing stuff  <br>He's kind of cool but I don't remember his motivation at all.</br>  <br>To bring down The Soul King as I recall.</br>  <br>What hability? Ichigo kicked his ass, it was not his fault being weaker</br>  <br> antagonist </br>  <br>His swords ability, as i recall he only needed to use it once in front of someone to have them under his illusion any time.</br>  <br>and Ichigo would just speedblitz him and kill him the moment he decided to use KS</br>  <br>I'm talking about the pre captains vs Aizen fight moment, Ichigo didn't have his power up back then so he could have easily used it without getting killed.</br>  <br>Calm yourself, Momo.</br>  <br> I heard they took him out to take a walk in his chair.<br> Did they show Momo's reaction?</br></br>   This entire thread is a Hallucination.    <br>Not even close.</br>  <br>He hasn't had his flashback yet, so we still don't really know.<br>He wants to kill the Soul King and take over reality, but we don't know precisely why.<br>He, along with Urahara, seems to have seen the Soul King and/or know more about its true nature than anyone else, but that too has yet to be revealed to the readers.<br>Ichigo thinks that deep down he's just lonely because he's so strong and intelligent nobody can hold a candle to him. That's probably a key part of the story.<br><br>By the point they fought, he was evolving to the point where he wouldn't need to rely on it any more. My guess is that he was well aware of the Royal Guard's powers considering how much he seems to know about the Royal Realm and the Soul King, and he therefore anticipated that Zanpakutou abilities wouldn't likely be of much use against Nimaiya, who invented Zanpakutou, or Ouetsu, who could just take away its name and abilities.<br>Ichigo was Aizen's attempt at pushing himself to become stronger, as well as a manifestation of his desire for someone as strong as him. His goal in the fight against Ichigo wasn't just to win, which he might have been able to achieve with Kyouka Suigetsu (especially if he finished Ichigo before he could power up), his goal was to fight an opponent that would force him to break his limits and become strong enough to achieve his ultimate goal (which probably would've happened if not for Urahara's kido - even Mugetsu couldn't kill him, and he was beginning to heal)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   No     <br>God that version of him so not as loveable. But I feel like Kubo goes out of his way to make him as sex as possible. Same with both Zangetsu</br>  <br>I'd lick the hogyoku.<br>And other parts</br></br>  <br>You'd disintegrate before you even reach him.</br>  <br>Worth the try</br>  <br>tfw Ichigo will be the only one able to touch him ;_;</br>  <br>Nah<br><br><br>He was touched by him.  Unohana got to undress him though </br></br></br></br>  <br>As it turns out, Aizen's "base form" was probably faster than Ichigo up until the dangai training. There's also the fact that many Captains can use their shikai without calling its name: in fact, that's probably how the whole "since when were you under the impression" thing came into play. Aizen released his sword during the fight with the Captains without announcing it.<br><br>Aizen was and is pretty bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Which is why we love this smug bastard.</br>  <br>Careful, Fraudrin is on your ass and he doesn't need illusions to troll the story and actually succeeded with accomplishing his goal and punking out everyone.</br>  <br>He pulled off the dork look so well that at first I didn't even realize he was the villain, though I didn't really buy that he had been killed.<br><br>It's hard to believe that anyone who knew what a Captain's spiritual pressure felt like wouldn't call bullshit. Someone would have felt something, and there'd be SOME damage to the nearby buildings that would indicate a struggle.</br></br></br>  Hey mythologyfags<br><br>Is it true that Aizen Myoo gave up his godhood for a human? I've read that only once long ago, and can't seem to find it anymore</br></br>  <br>Aizen worship thread? I'm ok with this</br>  That is Satan-sama.  <br>His flowing robes form a swastika</br>  <br>But Aizen is the Morning star, anon</br>  What would a fusion of Aizen, Zangetsu, and Jugram would look like?  <br>OH SHI-</br>  <br>But does he have tits, anon?<br><br>I don't think so.</br></br></br>  <br>It would look like Ichigo</br>  <br>FGT Ichigo?</br>  <br>Satan is the best waifu and husbando, pleb.</br>  Best looking Bleach males?  <br>It could not sustain its own presence under the weight of its own Kubo, and would ultimately vanish from our plane of existence in a puff of keikaku.<br><br>Somewhere, in that exact moment, a child would be born who would one day rule the world.</br></br></br>  <br>You called?</br>  <br>since when where you under the impression that he doesn't have</br>  It's hard to believe everything after Soul Society was done by the same author. Hueco Mundo wasn't so bad, but even that started paling in comparison to the earlier parts of the series.<br><br>I blame the anime studio honestly. He was doing pretty good until they tried to get him involved with the anime development. Then the whole series just started spinning out of control.</br></br>  <br>Is that even a question?</br>  <br>Canon and official breasts anon.<br><br>Satan's superiority remains. Everyone else is a pale shadow.</br></br></br>  <br>Something about Kubo stubble beards makes men look so much better. Yhwh looks like shit but Zangetsu is at least decently handsome. But his teen versions.</br>  <br>be gone</br>  <br>Shounen used to be so good. What happened?</br>  <br>I need more sad Aizen in my life.</br>  <br>And I need more of Aizen's full lips stretched in an arrogant smirk. I don't want to see him sad</br>  <br> defeated by mc <br> most based <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragon Ball happened.</br>  <br><br>I feel Satan is too overpowered, but I suppose that's the point.</br></br>  <br>be gone</br>  <br>He always has a shit eating grin, other emotions are great.</br>  <br> still being under the impression he's actually fucking defeated and sealed </br>  <br>does that count?</br>  <br>He's high as a kite though.</br>  <br><br>No. After all. OP question:<br> Is he the most based antagonist ever? <br><br><br>the point is that the Achilles' heel was MUH AKIRA. <br><br><br>Dragon Ball wasn't that bad first, but it got bad when the saiyans were introduced.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>never satisfied</br>  <br> being under the impression he's relevant besides teasing some of his fans <br><br>Ichigo kicked his ass.

But still.  <br> Why can't he be real ;_; <br>he is in our hearts<br><br><br>no</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You got me thinking now... stubble or anything where the facial hair isn't taking over too much (like for example Starrk has) often looks better than that bushy, just-got-off-mountain look, not just when it comes to Bleach characters. Perhaps it comes kinda like a little bit of rebellion in smooth perfection.<br>Of course, Zangetsu is younger than Yhwach, while still being a developed male, so that too gives him extra points.</br></br>  <br>Michael wasn't waifu material.</br>  Akira = Ichigo.<br>Ryo/Satan = Rukia+Aizen.<br>Miki = Orihime.</br></br>  <br>Tensa Zangetsu/Teen YHWH are still cute as fuck.

She ruined season 2</br>  <br>China a best</br>  <br>But Anon, Rise and Nana are the OTP.</br>  <br>That may be so but Rise is still my least favorite yuru. That doesn't mean I don't like her though</br>    I want to hug Yui!  <br>Welcome back!</br>    <br>Thanks! I love you anon-chan!</br>  <br>Kyouko wants to hug yui!</br>  <br>H-how can you dislike her?</br>  <br>i don't! himawari is a beautiful girl and i hope she and sakurako stay together forever.</br>  Cutenatsu is the best Yuru.

I guess Sakurako. I like her, just not as much.</br></br>  <br>Don't be sad, the Yuru's will always be with us!</br>  <br>what happends when namori  dies? </br>  Man, I need to start checking Bakkin more often.<br> All that Akari x Yui in chapter 98. <br>Yesssss.</br></br>  <br> ... <br> tripfag </br></br>  <br>Well... <br>The last published doujin, from the author of SF, was from Non Non Biyori, in 2014.<br>So yeah...<br>http://purimomo.sakura.ne.jp/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sweet.</br>    Which is worse, Yuru Yuri or death?  <br>I hope you mean no Yuru Yuri or death.<br> I am legitimately frightened of what's going to happen to me emotionally the day that YRYR is confirmed to be discontinued. </br></br>  <br>Ditto for me, which is why I'm so terrified of this <br> We already had to live through Kyouko and Yui, we can't lose Ayano too ;_; </br></br>    Someday in the future, our civilization has ended and future archaeologists excavate remnants indicating we worshiped lesbian tomatoes. What will this tell about us?  <br><br>That we knew better than the future.</br></br>  <br>Considering the fact that the future will consist of nothing but lesbian tomatoes, they will no doubt gladly cherish the roots of their civilization, which we laid down for them so lovingly.</br>    <br> Yui is boring <br>Being relaxed isn't boring. She's a lot more relatable than any of the other characters and, in my opinion, is just as funny as anyone else.</br></br>  Is the show going to pick up where it left off during season 3 in that the characters will still be 14? I wouldn't be as comfortable if there was some giant jump in time, seeing as it's been like 3 years.<br><br> inb4 read the manga </br></br>  <br>read the manga<br> they won't age </br></br>  <br>Same nigga. I just started watching this and it's usually all I have on my mind while going about my day. Seems unhealthy.</br>  Who's your favorite character and why is it Yui?  <br>That's a funny way to spell Chitose.</br>  <br>That's an even funnier way to spell Ayano</br>  <br><br>Yui a shit<br>Chitose a best</br></br></br>  <br><br>Chitose is such a fucking old person</br></br>  <br>Cheetos is great.<br><br>Nice meme.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a wonderful and   lewd   old person.</br>  <br>Does it qualify as a meme if it's true?</br>  <br>Akari and Chinatsu at the same time.</br>  <br>You saw it somewhere, and repeated it, it's a meme.</br>  <br>Don't even fucking say Akari's name in the same sentence as that bitch niggas.</br>  <br>I saw it in the show</br>  <br>Onions this cute can't be old.</br>  <br>Yui is a dull girl.</br>  <br>\Kyouko/ \Kyouko/ futsuu ni dekiru ko \Kyouko/<br>\Kyouko/ \Kyouko/ deban mo juubun \Kyouko/</br></br>  <br><br>What good taste you have, anon-chan</br></br>  <br>refer to<br/></br>  I will have to go with Himawari because she uses "watakushi" even though she is not an ojou-sama or rich. That's blasphemy.  <br>She's kinda dull without Kyouko.</br>  <br>Anon, the entire world is "kinda dull" without Kyouko, let's be honest here.</br>  <br>My life is dull without Kyouko.</br>  <br> liking worst yuri </br>    <br>I don't even even a need a sentence, just one word.</br>  <br>If it weren't for Yui, Kyouko would probably have already consumed the entire world.<br><br>Face it, they need each other.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not very Yuru.</br>  Who are those nasty twins who spew disgusting drool and blood from every orifice? Their was that episode where they were cleaning their room and kept getting their nasty pig excretions all over the room. Absolutely discuting.  <br>Chitose (blood) and Chizuru (drool).</br>  <br>That was just the younger twin. Chitose was out doing things.</br>  <br><br>The best</br></br>  <br>The goddess of Yuri tolerates your bait.</br>  <br> playing easy mode <br>Filthy casual.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, Yui makes up for their awfulness</br>  <br>Hardly any "making up" is needed.</br>  You have 10 second to name Akari's outstanding qualities.<br><br>Hard mode: No "good girl"</br></br>  <br>Love</br>  <br>Akari a cute</br>  <br>Bun bazooka</br>  <br>She's a nice girl.</br>  What I don't understand about the fans of this show is that practically everybody wants to fuck one or all of the characters or do visually explicit things to them, yet when somebody so much as hints at any of them being straight, all hell breaks loose. So are they gay or straight?<br><br>I don't like this show because I want to have sex with the animated girls in it, I watch it because it's funny and cute. Make up your minds.</br></br>  <br>wh-why does she have big oppai</br>  <br> What I don't understand about the fans of this show is that practically everybody wants to fuck one or all of the characters or do visually explicit things to them <br>No, we don't. That's just /a/ shitposters doing what /a/ does best.<br><br> yet when somebody so much as hints at any of them being straight, all hell breaks loose. So are they gay or straight? <br>pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how the desires of a few fans correlates with the sexuality of the characters.<br><br>And we're all little girls here anon, of course we wouldn't mind  holding hands  with our favorite Yuru of choice. But since we can't, we just enjoy their cuteness from afar and laugh at their antrics.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a growing girl.</br>  <br> practically everybody wants to fuck one or all of the characters or do visually explicit things to them <br>Nice joke.</br></br>  <br>She makes the funniest faces</br>  <br>Not everybody has the same opinion. For example, your favorite yuru a shit.</br>  <br>Just because I use an Akari image, doesn't mean she's my favorite yuru</br>  is it just me or is it super cute when any of the characters try to speak english? I wish they would do it more often  <br>That line was so adorable I can literally recall it off the top of my head everytime I think of Himawari. I hope Himachan can get more moments like that in season 3, I always feel like she gets the spotlight less often than the rest of the main cast.</br>  Never forget  thread is dead, might as well post Yui      <br>The time loop is in the anime too, what with the school trip being repeated</br>  Chinashit  <br>chinachuuuu</br>  <br>literally worst character</br>  <br>Literally worst taste</br>  <br> stupid pink sex offender being your favorite </br>    <br>I honestly don't know what their names are, but judging by how much thought you put into your opinion it's probably a good one.</br>  <br>Also that one couple where one girl has big tits and the other girl is tsundere probably has at least 1 of the top 2 least interesting yurus.</br>  <br> I honestly don't know what their names are </br>  Mari-chan for president 2016  <br>A contender appears  but they can share </br>  <br> sharing <br>If you insist, but Mari gets 60% presidency</br></br>  <br>I want to marry Mari.</br>  <br>I hope you're not trying to imply that Mari-chan is planning to take advantage of Kaede's generosity.</br>  The only Yuru that I dislike is Chinatsu, but her character is well-written. Her creepy obsession with Yui, her past bullying, her awful cooking and creepy art. All of these things make me hate her, but still make her a well-written character.<br><br>It's hard for me to dislike any other Yuru, though.</br></br>  <br>Not at all, but Mari wanted to be president first</br>  <br>Her character is too well written. She's basically designed to be the shittiest human being to live</br>  <br>Can she really say no to this face?</br>  <br><br>Could anyone?</br></br>  <br>We're compromising, not disagreeing</br>  <br>Would Mari-chan be willing to negotiate down to meet in the middle at a 55% - 45% split in exchange for a promise between friends?</br>  <br>Fine, but Mari says the deal will only last for the entirety of the first term of presidency</br>  Can we really trust this  <br>wh-what is that?</br>  <br>Sea urchin sushi I'm guessing.</br>  <br>She has made a wise decision, and I have a feeling that she may have a change of heart once Kaede shows her that not everything in the world is truly sour.</br>  <br>Including everlasting sea urchin</br>  <br>does it even taste good</br>  <br>She's got my vote.<br><br>It's an acquired taste.</br></br></br>  <br>Can i be a sea urchin when i grow up?</br>  <br>Under Mari-Kaede law, yes you can.

The I and N keys aren't next to each other and you just have to tap I twice, no need to move your finger.

Rin is just a more common anime name than Rii so sometimes you just reflexively type what you're used to.</br>  <br>Some people are bad at remembering names, especially for shit tier characters like Rii.<br><br>Keyword is "was"</br></br></br>  Why is Yuuri so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  <br> Miku-nee <br> Rin <br>Vocaloidfags gtfo</br></br></br>  <br><br>Right, fair enough.</br></br>  <br>It's ok, she gets better</br>  <br> I always almost type Miku-nee instead of Megu-nee <br>I can understand typing Miku instead of Miki, but Miku instead of Megu? That's just rude to Megu-nee.</br></br>  <br> These three are cannibals <br> Left is on the menu before the GGs realize what's going on </br></br>   -nee <br><br>Fucking honorific faggots.</br></br>  <br>There hardly a single instance of her being called Sakura sensei in the manga, especially after  she dies  everyone refers to her as Megu-nee. For all intents and purposes, the nee is just part of her name at this point.</br>  <br>What should we call her then? Megu? Megumi? It just doesn't sound right without the -nee.</br>  What would you do if the gakkous sought refuge in your hideout?<br> But one of them is bitten and you don't know who </br>  <br> It's shovel </br>  <br><br> Seeing first episode <br><br>  most generic moeblob shit in years  <br><br> Last 2 minutes of the episode <br><br>Wait what fuck!!!??

Thanks for warning anon.</br></br>  <br>But she's cured  ...right? </br>  <br>Once you're bitten, its too late.</br>  <br>People are still doing this?<br>I mean, I hadn't ever read the manga or participated in many threads before the anime started airing, who just downloads crap randomly, even a little bit of research into the series will give you enough to know there is a twist.</br></br>  <br>I ask them who is bitten. I don't see why they would have any reason to hide it. It's not like I'll kill her right away.</br>  <br><br> &gt;But one of them is bitten and you don't know who <br><br>That's why everytime someones enters the hideout we conduct a full body inspection.</br></br></br></br>  I love this series, but the constant generals now that the anime has started are really getting bad.  <br>It was inevitable. And we can't even blame the animefags for this one, we've gone full Kancolle.</br>  <br>You should expect it, since we've already discussed all there is to discuss. There's nothing left to do but waifupost until next episode / chapter.</br>  <br>The next chapter comes a day after the next episode, so there'll be a lot of good discussion then.</br>  <br>MII-KUN BEST GIRL</br>  <br>in what magazine Gakkou Gurashi is sterilized?</br>  <br>I started reading the manga after the first episode, realizing the art and direction isn't very good in the adaption.<br>Looking forward to the next chapter, but what I don't get is how rushed the story is, its my 1 criticism of this series, they just jump between events instead of looking into them more deeply.<br>I just think it would be good if they took the development a bit slower.</br></br></br>  <br> sterilized </br>  <br>They're doing that in the anime already.</br>  <br>Manga Time Kirara Forward.</br>  <br/>  <br>YOU HAVE IMPECCABLE TASTE BROTHER</br>  <br>oh.</br>  <br> sterilized <br>I legit loled. Thanks for that.</br></br>  <br>Kirara Forward.

If we don't do what they say they might do someting to her!" <br>Rii is still their leader, even if she's lost it (and does not yet know she can kill).</br></br>  <br>Oh, that's right.<br><br>With her being cold to the touch, I doubt the bikers would want to have their way with her.</br></br></br>  <br>They could be into that sort of thing.</br>  <br>Have you never watch Deadgirl?</br>  Miki a cute!  <br>You think they care?

This shit is pretty damn dark.<br><br>I also agree with OP, Megu-nee is best girl.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Best girl wouldn't bite one of her students.</br>  <br>Well, she  was </br>  <br><br>Best girl wouldn't have kept the bunker secret.</br></br>  Who will survive to the end?  <br>She was waiting for it to be safe to go down there. She didn't want to tell them and get their hopes up and force them to move faster than they were moving.<br><br><br><br>What did Mi-kun do with her body? I was half expecting them to come upon it, but it seems that Mi-kun got rid of it too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuki or Miki</br>  <br>It's all her fault.</br>  <br>She ate it</br>  <br>I assume she just moved it aside somewhere</br>  <br>Miki.<br><br><br>Probably left it there or dragged it to a side room. Almost definitely didn't bring her to the roof to bury her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Megu now lives in their hearts so don't ask anymore</br>  <br>They'd better do this part right.</br>    So why don't anyone warch this on nico with all hype there?<br>Also contributing to the view count?<br>You fags are not going to buy anything so at least help it to get more popular.</br></br>  <br>QUIT</br>  How long until she goes completely crazy?<br><br>Btw, is her kid real?</br></br>  <br>I want mexico edits anon back, this shit sucks</br>  <br>She'll go complete crazy when she realizes Ruu is a teddy bear</br>  <br>After detaching her head, she carefully balanced it on the blade of the shovel, flipped it up and batted it out of the school grounds.<br><br>That seems the most likely.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a lot of parts they have to do right lest they disappoint the manga audience. <br>First one is coming up next episode with the bathroom scene.<br>Then there's the Kurumi meeting Megu-nee scene.<br>Then the Rii attempted murder and Kurumi turning scene.<br>The Rii breakdown after the helicopter crash.<br>The Megu-nee flash back with the  fingernails <br>And most importantly of all, the graduation scene pic related.<br><br>I'm cautiously optimistic about them pulling it off, but Lerche is damn busy this season. I'm not sure if their gonna but in the time to do the scenes justice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ruu is as real as they get<br> Gao Gao </br></br>  <br>   fingernails <br>God, that shit has the potential to be the most cringe inducing thing this season. Can't stand shit happening to fingernails.</br></br>  <br>Ah! That's true!<br><br><br>THANK YOU!<br><br>I was trying to figure out if the kid was real, but I was positive the kid wasn't, but I couldn't understand why they were treating it as physically being there despite not treating Megu-nee the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They acknowledged Megu-nee plenty of times.</br>  <br>in case you want proof</br>  <br>I don't see any short haired Megu-nee?<br>could you provide a pic?</br></br>  Are any males still alive in Gakkou Gurashi?  <br>Because she is the most realistically portrayed.  Like any 2D character, she isn't real. </br>  <br>They're all crazed rapists now.</br>  <br>Yes, crossbow-kun and the biker bros. Pilot-kun was alive for a bit</br>  <br>I don't remember when, but it was at the start where it appears Kurumi is angry when asked to wait for Megu-nee. That basically spelled it out for me.<br><br><br>I thought the screaming scene was the one that gave it away. I didn't realize those things were ears, I thought it was a weird shadow or she was clutching a corpse or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Replying to a tripfag. </br>  <br>What actually killed Pilot-kun? He just kind of randomly got infected.</br>  <br>Please go away. You are fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Did someone request the return of Los Gurachos?</br>  <br>I wanna save Yuuri and adopt a loli and live the rest of my life away in a cabin far away with my new family.</br>  <br>He was already infected and relapsed. It's implied that the serum isn't a permanent fix and needs to be re-applied. Kurumi's next.<br>Also </br></br>    <br>Also what happened to Radio-chan. That's why she turned despite there not being any footprints on the roof, meaning she hasn't gone outside in a while.</br>  Soon  <br>Well, Pilot-kun's friends are still alive so there's them as well.</br>  <br>Well I got that it's implied that the serum isn't a permanent fix as per the recent, but did not get that he had been infected already.<br><br><br>There's no question about him being infected. I was just wondering how he got infected. This scene was the foreshadowing of what we later start to discover with Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So anyone?<br>What is your excuse?</br></br>  <br> There's no question about him being infected. I was just wondering how he got infected. This scene was the foreshadowing of what we later start to discover with Kurumi. <br>Fucker got bit. Same for Radio-chan.<br><br><br> zombie in a blue uniform ever <br>Yuki confirmed for sole survivor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soon</br>  <br>Wait, what, where is chapter, share pls.</br>  <br><br> sweat on his helmet <br><br>This triggers my autism.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Seeing first episode <br> &gt; most generic moeblob shit in years  <br> &gt;Last 2 minutes of the episode <br> Wait what fuck!!!??

I'm under the assumption that she stopped and is just pretending, which is why everybody thinks she's more mature.    <br>Do you really need that spelled out for you?</br>  <br> nah the delusion completely broke when Yuki killed a zombie </br>  <br>He thinks a helicopter is a plane, so he's probably retarded</br>  <br>It also disappeared when she finally said good-bye to Megu-nee.</br>  <br>How stupid can people be? This entire scene was the closing to Yuki's delusional arc. Notice how she's repeating the same monologue from Chapter 1, but this time she's seeing the rooms how they really are.<br><br>She's no longer delusional and is faking Megu-nee. He delusions started cracking around chapter 16 or so and she may have been faking Megu-nee as early as chapter 20.</br></br></br>  <br>A HEART OF BROKEN GLASS, DEFILED</br>    <br>Poor Yuki.<br><br>Though I honestly want to know how shit got so ruined so quickly.

If anyone interested you can finish my work, if not I finish it when i came back.<br>Can someone help me mark location where are barricades located and where girls are sleeping, eating etc...</br></br>  <br>yes but when i come back from work</br>  <br>If they have toilets in the barricaded area, how did a zombie get up there in chapter 5?</br>  Is this what we can expect from GG doujins?<br>http://exhentai.org/g/835400/e8ef73<wbr>139a/</wbr></br>  <br>it's before they expand the barricade, probably.</br>  <br>That's pretty much me and Kurumi right there.</br>  <br><br><br> Kurumi will never do that to you </br></br></br>  This part of the OP is going to be terrifying after episode ~7 or so.  <br>I have same question<br><br>didn't they started to push barricades to 1rd floor when  Megu-nee-san was still alive? </br></br></br>  <br>Guy who made it here<br>I could try that, but the thing is about these things is that there is only so much effort worth putting into something, so no promises, and if you see it, it would be in a future thread.</br></br>  If Shovel dies, I riot  This shot was a preview of the SUFFERING faces we're going to see later.  <br>Prepare those pitchforks, then</br>  <br>They never did expand the barricades, they just talked about it. On multiple occasions when referring to the barricades it's clear that only the third floor is blocked off. I guess in chapter 5 the zombros just got through the barricade somehow. That must be why Kurumi goes on patrol so often, because the barricades aren't perfect.</br>  <br>I hope not, it seems slightly weak.</br>  didn't know mono was at EVO edition  Haahahhaja  What if the loser subplot is that you can't live in the hotel anymore and have to watch the FC from the slums  <br>Unless it's the Death Penalty it probably doesn't matter.</br>  Why did they never call Yusei Kingu  <br>Because the position pretty much stopped being relevant after he got it, it was pretty much created for Jack and it seemed to be recreated by Jack's dueling circuit in the epilogue, Godwin's dueling circle ceased existing after the dark signer shit started going down.<br><br>Also, didn't Jack call Yusei kingu?</br></br></br>  <br>There was no time to do it after the tournament and by the time they were in the next arc, the WRGP thing was happening. Also, Jack's kingu was more like a stage name they made for him</br>  <br>It did seem to become Jack's stage persona, but wasn't it said at some point that it was actually the same title Yugi used to hold?</br>  <br>If Yuya wins against Jack in the rematch, will they call him Kingu?</br>  I've been watching the WRGP arc for the past few days and Jean is seriously gay<br><br>Yusei tries to shake his hand and the motherfucker rubs Yusei's hand with his fingers and Yusei's like the fuck<br><br>And then that flashback where he tells the bitch to shoo and he literally calls her a bitch</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with that anon.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Gon will lose and be taken someplace who knows where. <br> Reiji will have Ninja job to figure out where they're sent. <br> Sawatari will join them later. </br></br></br>  <br>Jean is literally the worst and not because of what you said but because of stuff that happens later.<br><br>I just remembered the reason I hated the WRGP is that none of those fucking characters came back</br></br></br>  so where is Yusei does he not exist in this dimension? Does that mean Judai and Yugi also don't exist?   You'll never get into the card game for the first time again <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>I don't know. Here, have some Yugo and his sensei.</br>  <br>Yusei is probably a tops. Living the life with his mom and dad and banging his girlfriend tittyflowerrosegirl.</br>  <br> tfw Grandpa Fudo will never teach you how draw like a pro </br>  <br>Seeing Yugo act so much like a standard shonen protag all the time makes Yuya seem less fitting as a card game anime MC.</br>  <br>Yuya is trash</br>  <br>Yuya is a very different kind of card game MC. I really like it compared to how I saw him before the show aired and I thought he was going to be something like Judai 2.0</br>  <br>Then he is the cutest trash I've ever seen</br>   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Jack Atlas so much, I owned all his cards and merchandise <br> I pray to Jack Atlas every night, thanking him for the burning soul I have been given <br> "Jack is love," I say, "Jack is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a traitor <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Jack <br> I call him a jealous commons <br> He duels me and beats me 2-0 because of Blackwings <br> I am crying now because my pride hurts <br> I lay in bed and it's really cold <br> A burning soul is moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Jack <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "This is entertainment" <br> He grabs me with his mighty arms and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my Duel Disk for Jack <br> He summons a bunch of monsters in one turn <br> I have no cards but I do it for Jack <br> I can feel my field emptying as cards are destroyed by his absolute power <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Jack <br> He laughs a mighty laugh as he synchro summons his very soul <br> My dad walks in <br> Jack looks him deep in the eyes and says, "There is only one king!

That's not bad or anything, its just how he is. Until season 3 anyway when he gets all the development.</br>  <br>Coldsteel was after 5D's though.</br>  <br>He is still the generic protagonist who win everything and with incredible luck but still i love his personality</br>  <br>He also had the coolest cards</br>  <br> stock card game MC <br><br>How many card game animes existed before YGO?</br></br></br>  <br>6</br>  <br> that "oh shit" moment when everyone saw the shadow hook </br>  <br>Well I mean in retrospect but I also meant regarding toyetic/collecting shounen anime</br>  <br>Your trash</br>  <br>He's not mine. i don't want it</br>  Who was better in Ygo bonds beyond time? yugi, jaden or yusei.<br>Personally i think jaden did better</br>  <br> BBT was 5 years ago </br>  <br>Wait a minute. So is mono not doing subs this week?</br>   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Yuzu so much, I owned all her cards and panties <br> I pray to Yuzu every night, thanking her for beating up my bullies <br> "Yuzu is love," I say, "Yuzu is life" <br> My mom hears me and calls me a heterofag <br> She is obviously jealous of my devotion to Yuzu <br> I call her a jealous whore <br> She duels me and beats me 2-0 because of Motorcycles <br> I am crying now because my father ran away <br> I lay in bed and it's really cold <br> An enchanting melody is moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Yuzu <br> I am so happy <br> She whispers into my ear, "It's all daijobu" <br> She grabs me with her crude strong arms and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my Duel Disk for Yuzu <br> She special summons a bunch of Melodious in one turn <br> I have no monster protection but I summon Odd Eyes Rebellion for Yuzu <br> I can feel my lifepoints draining as Bloom Diva reflects the difference in attack power <br> I push against her force <br> I want to please Yuzu <br> She laughs a gentle laugh as she Yugo summons Schuberta <br> My long lost dad walks in <br> Yuzu looks him deep in the eyes and says, "Yuya is mine now." <br> My shitty dad explodes in a shower of EGAO <br> Yuzu is love, Yuzu is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God damn it Yuya you cuck</br>  <br> her   hymen  intact</br>  <br>Yes but not until tomorrow or Thursday according to TLC-kun.</br>  <br>That'll do.

His steadfast principle should keep him from moving around the course. <br>I would find it pretty  entertaining if he didn't move though.  Too bad the preview showed him actually riding.</br>  <br><br>Yusei wasn't obsessed over it and never really cared for the title. <br>Or maybe it's just a title Jack gave to himself, like I dunno, Undertaker</br></br></br>  <br><br> Fudo no dueling <br> not on a motorcycle <br><br>His dueling style will finally be complete</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>His name is Jean.

It's a children's card game after all<br><br> are the Egyptian God Card even viable if they were allowed for use in actual duels? <br>They're not really allowed so no</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ra is</br></br>  <br><br>So subs never then</br></br>  <br><br>tumblr subs ;)</br></br>  I wonder if a doujin circle have the balls to make a NTR doujin of Yuzu and Yuuya.  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  Remember the 5D's movie intros when they had Jaden and Yugi show off a bunch of their monsters?<br><br>Think we'll get those kind of intros again for the new movie?</br></br>  <br><br>Japanese will like it because they are shit, while us will just hunt down the doujin circle</br></br>  <br> There are more doujins of Yuto/Yuzu than Yuya/Yuzu </br>  AKABABOWL CONFIRMED <br>GET FUCKING HYPE</br>  <br>consider suicide.</br>  <br>Yes, I can't wait for Yugo/Yuzu.</br>  YAMEROOOOO    <br> NTR doujin where all of the Ruris get stolen <br> I would read it </br></br>  <br>Probably not</br>  <br>there are playable versions of Ra(2 kinds counting sphere mode) &amp; Obelisk the tormentor,but no sky dragon.</br>    Would you NTR your cardfu with a Ruri?  <br> keeping the NTR shit <br> now with MY cardfu <br> and a Ruri that are already taken by their fruits <br>Do you suicide?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather have no partner than NTR or be NTR'd</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128414446 <br>Shit, wrong image click. I mean this.</br></br>  <br>DIE<br><br>DELETE THIS</br></br></br>  <br>wow fail 2 times, good job anon...YOU HAD ONE JOB, that that was not to fuck up.</br>  <br>No faggot. You tried that shit on a previous thread. You aren't fooling anyone.</br>  <br>But Slifer is playable.<br>If its good is a different story.</br></br>  <br>Totally not interested in a really fuck shit crap of fetish, and I support the Ruris with their Fruits. Seriously though why everyone is so obssesed with this awful crap?<br><br>Though a little harsh, I prefer that too.</br></br></br>  Why is it always late at night when the one NTR faggot comes and shitposts in these threads?  <br>yeah i didnt know about that, thanks Anon-senpai.<br><br>  senpai noticed me :^)  </br></br></br>  <br>It happens twice, man. Genuinely not intended to happen again. The image file is right besides each other.</br>  <br>i have no idea, i think its stupid as shit what kind of guy would like his lover be fucked in front of him is a loser or doesnt have the balls...but thats getting off topic so here is the best girl</br>  <br>How cardfus will look with the Ruris outfit?</br>  <br>I'm watching you faggot.</br>  <br><br>Be interesting. It would just murder any XYZ/Synchro attempt since it would just blow up the materials</br></br>  <br>I don't know, how Northwemko will look for you if she was with Serena clothes after joining Reiji?<br> In my case I want Winda with Rin outfit because hotto pantsu </br></br>  <br>What is Superheavy Samurai.</br>  <br>101 and Castel in defense position :&gt;)</br>  All I want is art of Yuya and Rin  <br>Castel would still die. Only 101 would live.</br>  <br><br>Servants of The Man</br></br>  <br>The Yuus should switch Ruris<br>Yuya/Rin<br>Yuto/Yuzu<br>Yugo/Serena<br>Yuri/Ruri</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree completely.<br>I don't even care who gets Yuzu, I just want my Yuya/Rin</br></br>  <br>How funny that Ra used to be the most garbage one and now it's the best one while Obelisk is more splashable and Silfer requires an entire deck dedicated to it and it still is the weakest. I wonder if Kaz had Atem use Slifer the most because he wanted him to have at least one badass dragon in his deck.</br>  <br><br>samefag pls</br></br>  <br>Everything is going to be ok, anon.</br>  <br> tfw pulled this out of a Gold series </br>  <br>What are you on.</br>  Is yugioh even any good? I remember watching it a long time ago when it was first airing in English. I didn't even like it back then. But, I've since taken up anime and have been on a tcg kick so I've been thinking of picking it up. Talk me into or out of it. And if I do pick it up, should I start back from the beginning or start with one of those new arcs with all new people?  <br>An anti-NTR crusade. Want to be first on the wall?</br>  <br>Yu-Gi-Oh! is pretty great.<br>Every series has its flaws, but overall there's a certain charm to each. They get progressively more Chuuni though.</br></br>  <br>Arc-V is ok since it includes all the current summoning methods. Watch whatever you want, but leave Zexal as the last option since it is the shittiest series.</br>  Jack is a fucking traitor I hope to Horakhty he gets carded like the traitor he is.  <br>Traitor at what? He abandoned all his friends and past just to be the king. It's inevitable.</br>  <br>Zexal can be pretty fun sometimes. Even if it is regarded as the worst you need to let him formulate his own opinion.</br>  <br><br> Yuya/Rin <br>Where is this come from?</br></br></br>  <br>Show wise, I believe someone somewhere constructed a sort of list of "Here's what episodes to watch and what fillers to skip" so if you really wanted to, you could start at GX. <br><br>If you don't want that one, 5D's is nice as well, up to a certain point, people will say how the dark signers arc is very good and then everything after it is junk. Up to you if you want to continue.<br><br>Zexal and Zexal II are trash, one of the worst MC's, who has a terrible habit of turboing into one ace monster when his deck is set up to be able to XYZ into almost any rank.<br><br>As for the card game, it's alright to a degree? Depends on both the meta and who you have to play with, you can easily play free versions of the game with YGOpro (A program which is automated so you don't have to worry about things like when to activate cards or where to put them) or DN (Browser based, more manual but easier to get into on the fly and you can easily allow others to spectate your games.)<br><br>I think /a/ plays mostly with pet decks, so you could have some fun for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tumblrshits that want yugo and yuzu as a pairing but feel bad about leaving yuuya out so they give him a random ruri.</br>  <br>Good thing that Yugo will be inside of Yuri soon.</br>  <br>I don't want Yuzu and Yuugo as a pairing. I want Yuuya and Rin to be good friends because I want Rin to die in a manner in which Yuuya will blame himself and Yuugo will also blame Yuuya. <br><br>I mean, I guess it'd be a cute pairing too.<br><br>Also &gt;Random<br>It's literally the inverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just sad.  I prefer the NTR route. </br>  I want NTR loving cuckolds to get the fuck out of my thread and never come back.  <br>I should probably add at YGO is a bit different lately also because it's shifted more to archetypes and themes more so than random cards, to give a sort of synergy.<br>So if you wanted, you could add Red-Eyes Dragon and make a deck based around it.<br><br>Also be prepared to read a lot, YGO does not like using shortened icons or keywords outside of something like Excavate or piercing and sometimes it can get really silly with wording.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't really matter Yuya(Berserk mode prob) will prob kill Yugo with or without the NTR. Only time Yuya saw him, he killed Yuto.</br>  <br>Read the dang card, sam.</br>  <br>Nah, Yuya specifically said that Yuzu is safe if she's with Yugo. Everything's going to be okay m8.</br>  <br> 2015 still believing horakhty <br>get on my level and follow the one true god, Z-One.</br></br>  <br> implying commons can read </br>  <br>I'M READING IT<br>AND ALL I'M READING IS IT'S GOT LOW ATTACK AND LOW POWER<br>JACK THE TRAITOR IN CHARGE OF LOOKING DOWN ON US COMMONS.</br></br></br>  <br>Let me use that card, then.</br>  Why did Reiji appear so late in the arc? Because he  declan'd  the script because it wouldn't make him feel all a  ]Shaymed  when his best lancers got arrested twice.  <br> He uses TRASH cards </br>  <br>I usually approve of NTR. But this would be too much, even for a NTR fan.<br>Have some Stardust Warrior instead.<br><br>Sphere Mode Ra is like a super Lava Golem, so it's the most "viable" one. And the funniest too.</br></br></br></br>   browsing WoWthread <br> suddenly this pops up <br><br><br> mfw Arc-V has transcended </br></br></br></br>  <br>/wowg/ might be one of the few places that is more degenerate than /dng/. <br><br>The fuck are you doing.</br></br></br>  <br>There is at least one more person here who frequents /dg/</br>  <br>/nosg/, I don't browse containment threads  except for this one :^) </br>  I want to card this fucking xyz scum.  <br>Fuck off sora</br>  I hope Gon can turn this piece of shit anti-hype spike we've had for the past two episodes into something good.  <br>NEW LEVEL 9 SHS</br>  You're now the protagonist of a YGO series, make up an archetype (one summoning only). <br><br>Also what the fuck is your crazy hair like?</br></br>  <br>Bald.</br>  <br>Yeah, no.

I thought the generic characters were just a joke behind the great story</br>  <br>Because I like to make my shounen seinen. You should hear my headcanon about the Yusei vs. Z-one duel.</br>  <br>go on...</br>  <br>Fuck off, my headcanon is absolutely autismo and unless it's animated in some form it doesn't matter because you don't get to see Jack get pissed off and denounce brotherhood with Yusei when he lets him die while trying to save Aki from Mekanikle.</br>  <br>It's probably the same as everyone else's: Z-One really is Yusei, but a Yusei who gave in to despair, whereas 5D's Yusei refuses to allow Z-Ones future to happen, rewrites Cosmo Blazar Dragon into Shooting Quasar Dragon by sheer force of will and alters the course of the future, causing Z-One to cease existing.<br><br>The way 5D's fucking should have ended.</br></br></br>  <br> reminder that Fusions are an inferior race that are to dumb to use anything other than brute force </br>  <br> Cosmo Blazar Dragon <br>Printed, when?</br></br>  <br> Fusion <br> niggers of YGO <br> not Rank 4 tooolbox black cards </br></br></br>  <br> you will never see future-Yusei with a broken D-Wheel crying with the rest of 5D's all killed from fighting Meklords <br> you will never see him demanding the Emperors to kill him too <br> you will never see the machines just walk away because he no longer has hate in his heart, only grief <br> you will never get to see Yusei genuinely cry at realizing he failed his best friends and family </br></br></br></br>  <br>Who and when was this?</br>  <br> ruled by someone who's most likely a standard  <br> probably got into power by showing off solid vision  <br> their tiny Fusion brains couldn't understand it so they just assumed he was a god </br></br></br>  <br>Grandpa Mutou when he was a treasure hunter in his youth. Scene is about how he got the Puzzle in the first place. Also reveals that he was a master of gambling and made a bet with himself that if he ever lost a bet, he would give up gambling and become a game shop owner wearing overalls.</br>  <br> dat get doe </br>  <br>He's also a card.</br>  So I'm just realizing this but Shooting Star Dragon and Shooting Quasar Dragon were just the same blank card Yusei had, weren't they?  <br>I wish this happened.</br>  <br>Naw Z-ONE pretty much provided those cards for Yusei because he wanted Yusei to put an end to him.</br>  <br>It really did fucking suck when Z-One revealed he is a Yusei cosplayer</br>  <br>I think Z-One only gave him one blank card and that was Shooting Star, no clue how Quasar got made</br>    <br>Do they really have all different pendants or is it just something the artist added?</br>  <br>Only Yuuya has a pendant.</br>  <br>When Arc-V Yusei appears.</br>  <br>It got made with raw, undiluted Kizuna.</br>  <br>Fucking saved.</br>  <br>I think the manga retconned it. Japan has a thing about their heroes being villains unless they're fake.</br>  HANASE  <br>How ra is the best?

Vampire LOLIs.</br>  <br> Serara is a pig <br> Akatsuki is legal loli <br> Ashlynn is true loli <br><br>Fixed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> soon <br>implying there isnt any right now. also doesnt have to be newfags. the normies here cant tell the difference as well</br></br>  <br>Except we're not talking about age here we're talking about the actual physical body here, fuck off with your LRD false flagging shit<br><br><br>Call her a legal loli or whatever you want, I don't care, but she is factually a petite A cup.</br></br></br></br>  <br> is not <br>Saying so won't make that true. Akatsuk is loli in every possible way that matters, being her body is that of a little girl. She fucking fits in when other lolis are playing around since she looks like a kid herself. If you even read the LN, there are lolicon jokes involving her and Minori. <br><br><br>No, shitposter. Just anything that looks like a little girl. Max is 12-13 for limit. Deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's factually a loli. Fuck off with your tvtropes shit.</br>  <br>God they fucked up the designs for the anime so badly, I'm still fucking mad</br>  <br>But the other people in the Log Horizon world sees her as loli, and thinks Shiroe is building loli harem.</br>  <br>Obviously not, otherwise everything not a troll would say Rori is a loli. She's freaking a canon loli and is intended so by the author and drawn so by official artists. Rori being a loli never was in doubt before the anime came. It's so obvious you are being a retard, LRD. Unkindly end yourself so make /a/ less shit.</br>  <br>Ok you are trying too hard<br>puppeteering, using forceful/aggressive language, same general narrative in every post<br>3/10</br></br></br>  <br>This picture is fantastic.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about?

How many numbers she has in years, how she is treated and viewed, it is all irrelevant, because she does not possess the body of a loli, and the only requirement for a character to be a loli is to have the body of a loli. Do I make myself clear now? Good.</br></br></br>  <br>At least you admit you're a troll shitposting because he can.</br>  <br> body of a teenage <br>Factually wrong. She has a body of a 13 year old. Get over it and deal with that.</br></br>  <br>You're the last person to be able to accuse lolifags for not knowing their loli, LRD. The entire point about her Rory being called and seen as a loli in-verse and by fans is because she looks like a loli.</br>  <br> anyone who disagrees with me must be a troll! <br>死ね<br><br><br>How many times do I have to tell you so you can get it through your thick fucking skull: when determining who is a loli and who is not, magical numbers don't mean shit.
