If I could read moon I'd look at the chart.</br>  I am surprised Classroom Crisis is ranked high. I understand that Maruto has fans, same reason Charlotte is on top with Maeda - but so far the show is shit.  <br><br>Why do you even care?</br></br>  I'm ok with this.  Praise the imouto.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V1l<wbr>M3zkzEWk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>bitch punch</br></br>  <br><br>Charlotte more popular than moeshi - waifu moeshit + yuribait Hibike!

Euphonium - You Los</br></br></br>  <br> To Love-Ru that low </br>  stalking japan everyday<br><br>you thieves are really creepy and pathetic</br></br>    Just an explanation, this is from a popular anime calendar site in Japan. The points are determined by how many of the users have marked the shows in their calendars.  <br> 20.GOD EATER </br>    <br>I'm pretty happy that Charlotte is doing well, but man TLR needs to be doing better.<br><br>Also, what the heck happened to Aquarion? I was kind of expecting it to be one of the better performers this season.</br></br></br>    <br><br>I thought they hated it.</br></br>  <br> 5.下ネタという概念が存在しない退屈な世界 </br>  twitter throws similar results   shiteater <br> last <br>Japan hates it as well it seems.<br><br>Malniggers/reddit niggers like it for some reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Classroom Crisis near the very bottom </br>  <br>Durarara on top? Least something is correct with this world. People remembered its best ark being animated.</br>  <br>That's not very fair comparison, though. Series that have had multiple cours are more likely to have more followers in Twitter.</br>   16 <br> Gangsta <br>Fuck the Japanese.... hard.</br></br>  <br>That reminds me. I don't see DRRR on OP's list <br>.</br></br>  <br>i'm pretty sure that thing measures TT and not followers even if it's called anime follower.<br>the season where kancolle aired it was consistently first with CG second and they both varied all the time.</br></br>   Symphogear second last <br><br><br>Seriously? I only watched the first episode, but it was utter shit<br> I am the messiah <br> Scroll monster <br> Break in, hijack plane, forced NTR </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I loved the last 2 aquarion shows with their flaws and everything but in these 2 episodes aquarion logos seems like its absolute garbage.</br>  <br>That's..........not a very accurate depiction of popularity, or how well received a show is. Why are we even bothering with this.</br>  <br>popularity = how many people are watching the show<br>In this sense, it is very accurate.</br></br>  <br>that shit measures popularity not followers.</br>  <br>Based on a online calender marker. I didn't even know such a thing existed before today, let alone anyone who uses one.</br>  <br>It does not. The durarara twitter account has ~120k followers which is the same number as in the chart.</br>  <br>Overusing that word only makes you look silly instead of helping you fit in, anon. Please stop, for your sake.</br>  <br>That's actually pretty decent taste.</br>  <br> 14. </br>  <br>Because pretending other measurements than volume sales or actual ratings somehow matter is the hip new way to shitpost.</br>  <br> 16.GANGSTA. <br> 20.GOD EATER </br></br>  <br>There's only about 12k marks total over 30 shows. Even under the very retarded assumption that each person only marked 1 show in their calender, that's still only 12k people using it. That's hardly alot nor accurate.<br><br>Not to mentioned like  said, who the hell needs such a thing to remind them when an anime airs</br></br></br>  <br>That's because you are a gaijin weeaboo.

And GATE is fucking terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>It's on the rank 33.</br>  <br> And GATE is fucking terrible. <br>As an adaptation, or on its own terms? I'm mixed on how slowly it's developing, in the sense that it's filling in parts from before the manga. Having Tuka and Rory will help a lot next episode.</br></br>  <br> cult following <br>That's just one way of saying unpopular.</br></br>  It's not surprised that Charlotte is popular in nips since it's Key.  <br>Damn, that's a severe case of shit taste right there. There's no way that 32 other shows beat it. That's like 3/4 of the season.

There is no interesting hook to keep me watching.</br>  <br><br>The PV got almost 1 million views, almost all comments were in Japanese. It's clearly popular as fuck and a classic to them. Sort of like Parasyte</br></br>  <br> Sort of like Parasyte <br>which sold fucking 800 copies</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> Parasyte <br><br>The anime sure sold well.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger are you serious<br>Parasyte is a classic in Japan's eyes. Tons of anime and manga were inspired by it. The only reason the anime didn't sell well was &gt;Madhosue and the fact that they changed designs and the setting, which pissed off a lo of people. <br>Hell, the manga, which ended in 1995, was selling like crazy after the anime. It's obviously popular, shitposter-kun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe because Igarashi is doing SB for next episode</br>  <br> 2.WORKING!!! <br> 19.オーバーロード <br> 20.GOD EATER </br></br></br>   Yuki-Chan that high in rankings <br>is it really that popular in nipland?</br>  <br><br>Its because they changed the artstyle.<br><br>It grew on me after I forced myself to watch it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ushio to Tora doesn't have a live action movie to promote.</br></br>  Can someone translate chong  <br>Check what signs are being used: shorthand signs with close friends or when in a hurry, formal signs with professional contacts. All fully animated and unobstructed. That's way the fuck more attention to detail than you'd expect for anime.</br>  <br> your <br> favorite <br> show <br> is <br> shit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Charlotte may be one of Key's best after it's over.</br>  <br>Not seeing aoharu.</br>  <br>it's shit</br>  <br>Looks like good taste to me.</br>  <br> thead </br>  <br>Mate, you can't just ignore nagato shit chan, which should be fifth.</br>  What you're showing is the viewer count, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're particularly liked shows. Reasons I could come up for these view counts:<br><br>Charlotte is Maeda who has very impressive reputation in Japan, obviously lot of people are watching this.<br>WORKING!! already has big fanbase, and as you can see it also gets high ratings by the audience. See <br>GATE I really can't explain, maybe the LN is popular or the whole military setting is making lot of people curious.<br>Classroom Crisis has staff with generally with good reputation and is getting Igarashi episode next, so the view count is hardly surprising.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like that top ten except for WORKING!!! and Classroom crisis<br><br>Working would be nicer if anything ever happened, you can literally watch the episodes out of order and still not miss anything.<br><br>Classroom crisis was retarded<br> Guy is being held for a ransom of 7 million <br> Lets blow 500 billion yen and a robot it took us years to build while trying to save him even though he had everything under control </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the point of CC, the teacher is hopeless and Nagisa as their boss isn't going to take any of that shit anymore.</br>  <br>Guys, only children watch Anime in Japan</br>  <br>Im not going to take any of that shit anymore either</br>  This is some good taste though.<br>The top ten is spot-on solid.</br>  <br>Everything about this post is correct and it makes me sad.</br>  <br>I mean, you'd think that it'd be more popular *because* it's shit. Or maybe in spite of it, I dunno.</br>  <br> 2.WORKING!!! <br>Excellent</br></br>  <br> 長門有希ちゃんの消失 <br> Yuki-chan <br> that high <br>don't know how to feel about this</br></br></br></br>   Gate <br><br>Good to see the japs have some nationalism again.</br></br>   Boring world where the concept of jokes does not exist <br><br>We need more accurate titles like this.</br></br>  <br>But jokes do exist and they're glorious</br>  <br> 1.Charlotte <br>As expected of AOTS</br></br>  <br>No anon.<br><br>This is a Boring world where the concept of jokes does not exist.

Look at how many fujo titles win each season. Already for Spring we have Kekkai and UtaPri. Fujos buy Working for Kamiyan,OnoD, and FukuJun. I realize DRRR isn't as popular but surely it's enough to be top 10 still. I can't understand how 32 fucking shows topped it.</br>  <br>It just isn't very good.</br>  <br>Simply put, no one cares anymore.</br>  It's gatchaman doing ok?  <br>It boosted manga sales and promoted the movie</br>  <br>Fujo doesn't mean female otaku</br>  <br>This doesn't mean shit post the stalker rankings</br>  <br>I'm avoiding Charlotte like it was ebola, is really any good?</br>  <br><br>No, it says the follower count of the official twitter accounts.</br></br>  <br>Only two episodes out so far, but the animation and pacing have been god-tier.</br>   Jap Shit Taste  <br>the epicest meme</br>  <br>People are interested in new shows and want to check them first before deciding which ones they are going to watch or drop.<br>This is no different from the list that measures the hype before a season starts.<br>As for the calendar shit we were using mahou.org before it got closed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>See the dog picks up the face.<br>It was worth the whole anime</br></br></br>  <br>See the dog picks up the face.<br>It was worth the whole anime</br></br>  <br>I will give it the 3-episode attempt... For the imouto, if nothing else.</br>  <br> Also, what the heck happened to Aquarion?  <br>Zessica lost before this season started.<br>There's no point in even watching it.</br></br></br>  <br>Please stop posting to this board. Nobody can understand what you're saying.</br>  <br> &gt;To Love-Ru that low <br>That's because the first TLRD season had:<br>1. Good production values<br>2.

You don't even realize it but when you go to cartoon conventions your pet ferret makes fun of you.</br>  The charts are shit in this thread, no need to bother yourself with it.  <br>Nips still love Haruhi despite all the memes that /a/ spouts. Now if Satelight got to do a 3rd season the internet would break.</br>  <br> 20.GOD EATER <br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAH</br></br>  <br>ledouche having shit taste as usual</br>   16. Gangsta <br><br>fuk fukkity fuk. Damn japan and their purity/borderline ecchi show.</br></br>  Why is Symphogear so low?  <br>They hate it because it looks like shit anon. The manga has a decent following. Same thing with Jutsu wa.</br>  <br>This is like a hype list.<br>Let's check it again after every new anime released its third ep.</br></br>  <br>Well the artwork wasnt your typical moeblob or LN drawing so yeah u probably right.</br>  <br>Looks like a pretty good taste to me. Japan, I'm proud.</br>  <br> Working would be nicer if anything ever happened, you can literally watch the episodes out of order and still not miss anything. <br>Yes, that's the point of a sitcom. Even then there's actually slow but steady plot development between Takanashi and Inami. And the other characters should have their plot resolved in this final season too.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I remember that LN author list that came out and how a bunch of 2chers ranked them and Tanigawa got an A. Guess he's still held in high regard over there. Now if he could just release a fucking new vol.</br>  <br> Working!!! <br> 2. <br>Boy.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean a show that has a minimum of animation and looks at least visually passable gets great sales like Psycho Pass S1. It's just that Gangsta looks like utter shit. I mean it's not even neo-Deen tier.</br>  <br> i dont like what they like so I will bitch and create a thread and say they have shit taste,but I will simply show a graph and bring nothing into the conversation to support my claim that they have a shit taste  <br><br>is /a/ a preschooler whining?</br></br></br>  Would you a princess?  Princess for loving, secretary for fucking.  I'd rather her Redcoat assistant.  <br>Are they a princess that's actually a boy?</br>  <br>Only if she forces her boy friend to watch</br>  <br><br>If the right one I came in....</br></br>  <br>I'd fuck her.</br>  <br>why not cuddle her instead?</br>  <br>or hug her :)</br>  <br>Fuck yes, I'd that princess</br>  I would put a shitload of works on her and make a ridiculous deadline  <br> not blind <br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>On a related note did we ever get good subs for the OVA?</br>  I'd marry her.  <br><br>I don't know about that. All I've got here is raw.</br></br>  <br>Best girl right there.</br>  <br>I think the clothes are confusing you, that is actually not Sento</br>  <br>Latifah's had it up to here.</br>  <br><br><br>This show got OVAs?? Damn. So theyre not translated?</br></br></br>  <br>The chibi shorts are translated, but far as I know, the full-length OVA only got half-assed subs by an /a/non.</br>  <br>YES<br>Latifah is best AmaBuri.</br></br>  <br>Sento a cute</br>  <br>Ashe &gt; Sento</br>  Pure princesses like her are best corruption material.<br>They always end up falling for the dick the most.</br>    <br>I would a better princess.</br>  <br>She's easy to persuade, too.<br> Wouldn't she reboot to pure every year, though? </br></br>  <br> mfw I'm not the only one who actually listens to her music. </br>  <br> I'd rather her Redcoat assistant. </br>  <br><br>I want to hold Latifa gently in my arms, have her sit on my lap and listen to her talk about her day, her hopes and wishes, pet her and tell her what a good girl she is.</br></br>  I might a princess.

About to pick something else at random to read from translation lists.</br>  I've been reading that Death March webnovel.  <br><br> Worm <br>I couldn't get past how stupid the main character was and dropped it like 30 chapters in. I figured I'd enjoy it too since Sheeprabbit recommended it.</br></br></br>  <br> Hachi-nan <br><br>Literally never heard of this being mentioned on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> Zaregoto.  <br>Fuck that MC, fuck him. Holy shit he really should just fucking die. Fucking shit.<br> Bravo nisio, bravo. </br></br></br>  <br>Translation pace for that has been amazing.</br>  <br> lolis everywhere <br>Picked up.</br></br>  <br>drama? its asuper hero story, with a female protagonist and some cool powers, pretty long and its already finished, rate 8.2/10</br>  <br>Really? I thought it was ok, though I've heard it gets kind of ridiculous later.</br>  Altina 8, 9 and Guns and Magic. <br><br>What a waste of time.</br></br>  <br>Glad im not the only one who thinks this. It just got so boring after the timeskip and him arriving in xaos</br>  <br>How is it self insert when MC doesn't give a shit about lolis even though he attracts lolis all the time.<br><br>Pisses me the fuck off. Fuck the author.<br><br>Don't make a loli story and then have an anti lolicon MC.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Death March has more lolis I think. MC pretty much adds one or two lolis to his harem every town he visits while keeping around 4 lolis in his main party.</br>  mahouka vol.12<br><br>because ONII-SAMA</br></br>  <br>wtf is wrong with this guy, is he a high grade loli magnet?</br>  <br> Suzuki, an adult programmer, suddenly notice that he's thrown into another world wearing a casual clothes at level 1. He gained high level and treasures after using the 3-times-disposable-magic, Meteor Shower, once. After that he intend to do another world "sightseeing tours"? <br><br>What the hell does this mean?</br></br></br>  <br>The loli on his lap looks like best girl.</br>  <br>Wordmaster also gets 1 or 2 loli every place he goes. A couple of them are actually lolihags though.</br>  <br>You know what they say, if you see one guy and a fuckton of girls, it means either he's queer or you're getting cucked.</br>  <br>Mia is pretty good. <br><br><br>His  childhood friend / previous life's wife that's a goddess cursed him to attract flat chests.  </br></br></br></br>  <br>It takes place in a world with video game stats. The world gave him a title that makes loli attracted to him.</br>  <br>Really? I read word master up to like chapter 80 and there was only like 2 lolis that were interested in him.</br>  The new gate and Tsuyokute: new saga.<br>Starting Owari no Chronicle because I have a lot of time this month.</br>  <br>Been keeping up with a few random stories on aho-updates listings, but I haven't really been wowed by anything recently.<br><br>I did recently read all that was translated of the Zashiki Warashiki of Intellectual Village. While it has a neat setting, I kind of find the characters flat and the dialogue atrocious. Every single fucking villain monologues their entire fucking plan or how their power works near constantly. I get that with such an intricate setting immersed in old mythology you need to explain some shit, but it's handled so horribly.<br><br>Though it was interesting enough for me to read through all five translated volumes at least.<br><br><br>Worm has its ups and its downs, but it has some of the best use of superpowers I've ever seen in fiction. And the climax of the story is one of the few things I would describe with the word epic despite that word's extreme overuse.<br><br>It is incredibly long so it takes quite a while to get to that payoff though. Also due to being a superhero series, there are a lot of fucking characters. And those are hard to remember and keep track of in such an extremely long story, but surprisingly it manages it well though I guess that's one of the reasons it's so damn long. It's also not shy about killing characters off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The important question is whether he hooks up with the loli or not.<br>Oda Nobuna is probably the worst in that aspect (pervert protag, yet disgusted by lolis), but Black Bullet has the old hag childhood friend winning too.</br></br>  Since an anime is basically confirmed at this point, might as well read up to bitch about secondaries in the threads<br>:^)</br>  <br>Does he have his Lolislayer title yet? I think he starts to pick up more of them after that.</br>  <br>Dude wakes up at level one, realizes he has a spell he can cast three times, and then decides to treat everything as a vacation.</br>  Is the an epub for Death Match besides vol 1?  I've started to read Elvenblood. It's up on the same site of Anti Magic. Overall, it has very high edge content and the story seems pretty predictable right now. On the other hand, it's about killing elves so it's okay.  <br>why /a/ hates elves?</br>  <br> Lolis Bath <br>How amazing that feel ?</br></br>  Anyone read Close Combat Mage? It's fun, but I can't help but think the author totally fucked up after revealing MC can basically bloodbend.  As I Lay Dying and some of Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories.  <br><br>Funnily enough, while he attracts lolis all the time, he really likes older girls with big tits. <br><br>The hero of the country that Arisa talks about attracts the type of girls the MC likes, while the hero himself likes lolis but only gets women with big tits in his harem.<br><br>They're both cursed to get the opposite of what they want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Chapter 45 of Tensei Shitara Slime translation just came out.<br><br>Wow Rimuru is about to get a large number of guests to his city.</br></br>  <br>Aren't there like 3 different groups translating this or something?</br>  <br>Not anymore. One group translated 4 chapters, another group translated from there until like chapter 12, then someone else picked it up from there until 18. Clown picked it up and has done up to chapter 45. <br><br>I think there might be another group doing the LN version but they're only at around chapter 10 of the WN storywise.</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to AntiMagic's release schedule.<br><br>The author seemed fast at release volumes before.<br><br>Now we are left with an annoying cliffhanger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he really likes older girls with big tits. <br>Thanks for protecting me from reading it. Time to stop the dl.</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate how I have to go to three websites with horrendous designs to read this shit</br>  <br>Yeah, I almost dropped it. I don't understand why they can't just put it on that mainsite.</br>  <br>which ones are you talking about w the one with the lolis fanfiction or the black one?</br>  <br><br>You're going to stop reading it because of a preference? At least give it a try, he destined to live a flat chested life for the most part.<br><br>I say for the most part because he's completely smitten by the queen of elves and in future spends a lot of time courting her because he really does love her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Yeah, it's pretty bad going through those sites but what can we fucking do about it? <br><br>The worst one is the one with the loli dialogue every chapter, it's pretty horrifying what insanity can do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're going to stop reading it because of a preference? <br>No, I'm not going to stop, I just protect myself from starting it and face inevitable disappointment and anger.</br></br>  <br>New volume just came out a few months while ago. It takes time for new volumes to come out you know.</br>  <br>Currently waiting on Baccano's only untranslated volume so far that just happens to be right in the middle of the novels.<br>Also waiting on Korean Zombie volume 5 .pdf.</br></br>  <br> Baccano's only untranslated volume so far <br><br>Didn't all fantranslations just die from the license?</br></br></br>  <br><br>But the main woman he likes is a mature elven queen, it's not like he's going to drown lolis forever.</br></br>  <br>Translator updated it this month, so no. He said he might as well complete it since there's only a chapter and half left and then the entire series so far will be fully translated.</br>  <br>I don't mind the loli rambles, I just ignore them.<br><br>I'm just mainly annoyed that there's a main site that seems to serve no purpose except redirect to three other sites. It's a pain.<br><br>Also, I can't believe people voting for that one poll with translating dialogue options.

And she's  reincarnated so she's like 30-something inside in the body of a loli. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stick with Wordmaster.<br><br> 《Little Girl Killer》 <br> You seem to be an existence that are blessed by, and attracts, little girls. In the eyes of little girls, your charm has suddenly increased. This is surely because you are also a Loli-- </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What else can we do, we are at 155/700 chapters if you want to drop it then godspeed anon, because from what I hear it's just him becoming more and more broken and beating shit up, eating until the ending where he fights a big bad and  dies, but comes back in the end to reunite with the rest of the cast. No one won the wordbowl. </br></br>  <br>That's not really different than Death March though, Hiiro is not attracted to any of the lolis he runs into. He doesn't end up with one either. At least Satou is nice to the lolis plus he's pretty much destined to end up with multiple wives at this point anyway.</br>  <br>how the fuck did he manage to lose having such a game breaking cheat hability?</br>  <br><br>As his fame grows more and more nobles chuck their daughters at him, but he always gets away before getting chained up.

She's the one that gave him the 3 powers when he was transported to the world the novel takes place in. </br></br>  <br>It's one of the intermission chapters that was already translated.  Yes Childhood friend girl joins the party later, she's actually the Hero Yamato that founded the empire or whatever. She originally was going to go back to her world but found out Satou was going to get summoned here in the future through some kind of oracle so instead she entered basically hibernation for 500 years to wait for him. <br><br>It's not her Goddess self though, just normal Satou childhood friend.</br></br> </br>  <br>http://www.sousetsuka.com/2015/06/d<wbr>eath-march-kara-hajimaru-isekai_22.<wbr>html<br><br> "Fuhn nanoja, I hate Satou.

Kinda just skipped over them, thanks. <br><br> God bless I love childhood friends, thanks. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's going to be a bad one though, 9 volumes in 2 cour.</br>  <br>It's confirmed they're going to adapt 9 volumes?</br>  <br>Apparently so, I was cautiously optimistic about the anime too.</br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei<br><br> MC marries 3 girls <br> All of them are perfect waifus (Eris &amp; Roxy are best though) <br><br>  <br>Just finished Shieldbro, seems my taste isn't that bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  After going through Death March, I finally decided to dive into mondaiji-tachi. Reading elvenblood as well, but I instantly go through them whenever kry releases, so mondaiji will have to do. <br><br>Got mahouka on my backlog, but got sao before that.

Go read the novels, they been translated up to the current volume. <br>In all honestly i think i read the first novel and it was kind of stupid with swords &gt;guns.

Should i hunker down and read through it?</br></br>  <br> swords&gt;guns <br>That's really not in the first volume at all, did you even fucking read it?</br></br>  <br>I read this like years ago man, last thing i remember reading was the guy using a sword or something when the school was being attacked and some magic shit happened with the sword</br>  <br>Did the translators of this ever stop being massive faggots?

Magic artifacts and tools may have practical everyday use but magic cast by people is always about making bigger fireballs or rain of ice shards. <br><br>Surely there are more productive uses for having phenomenal cosmic force at your fingertips. Like in Mickey Mouse in the Magician's Apprentice or in Harry Potter when it's used to make housework easier. Or in Lord of the Rings when Gandalf uses it to make pretty fireworks.</br></br>  <br>Cause the ones you're talking about are based on MMORPGs.<br><br>If you read Mushoku Tensei, there's a ton of utility magic and it's a lot more flexible. It's just about how creative and imaginative you are when it comes to devising new spells.<br><br>But when you're talking about shit based off vidya games? Really? What vidya game do you know has a spell that heats up water for the bath while you take a shit next door?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why are the magic systems in WNs and LNs always so oriented and ranked in terms of their combat utility? <br>Because the story centers around the kind of people who use magic in combat, rather than utility.<br>For some reason, the authors rarely think about adapting that kind of magic outside of combat.<br><br>"So what if it's an RPG World?" is a WN that focuses more on combat, but at the same time the author makes a point about how magic has tons of other applications, like Air-ships and advancing technology.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's the magic system dilemma. You want a magic system, what will you chose?<br>For a lack of better terms, the RPG system or traditional Witches and Wizards.<br>The RPG system works incredibly well for combat. Elements, circles, runes that can be manipulated and formed into attacks. Its really easy to build upon it and explain how stuff works or is made. Because of its "modularity" it can be expanded in many ways.<br><br>Witches and Wizards on the other hand is all about the mystic. Recite a spell and an action happens. How it happens is not explained. Could be gravity could be any kind of elementary force. It isnt explained at that is this kind of magic's charm.<br><br>You could add gravity or force in the RPG system as elements but then it would degrade into a physics textbook as you find ways to abuse it, not so much shounen now.<br>I could go on but i think this is enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mushoku Tensei <br>the only magic I remember is Water Ball, Rainstorm, Earth Bullet, Swamp, Frost Nova, Thunderbolt, Thermonuclear explosion, gravity magic, and that magic cancel spell that I think Magonote forgot all about. Also some healing magics and some barrier stuff we never see. None of these have any place in activities of daily living besides healing. I guess you could argue water ball plus wind could be used for washing and drying clothes but why waste mana when you could just wash them in a basin and dry them in the wind?</br></br>  I've been reading Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku o again since skythewood started translating the third volume, hope he'll pick up the fourth soon. <br><br>Other than that Im reading Hikaru and Rokka no Yuusha while waiting for someone to start translating my guilty pleasure  Hidan no Aria  I know  again.</br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of Mushoku Tensei, I still find myself wondering what exactly you do in magic university. We're given to believe that magic for the vast majority simply requires you to memorize and recite the incantation and this acts like a macro to automate the process of activating a certain set magic routine. And more complex and forceful magics have longer incantations. But nobody understands magic from first principles since nobody knows how to use it unvocalized, and nobody is inventing new spells, and thus all magic is basically empirical. Thus, how could a course at magic university last for five years (or however many years it was)? How much could there possibly be to study, and what could you possibly write your thesis on?</br></br>  <br>You can warm up water with fire magic, water your plants, or produce new soil for it.<br><br>That said, because normal people can't use voiceless, and because magic circles are expensive, using spells is just kinda stiff unless you can be creative in application. Because MT magic is more grounded and is based within several systems and categories, Harry Potter's "self cleaning dishes" wouldn't be possible.<br>On the other hand, most other things are still possible, like how Zanoba created living dolls (or rather, androids?) and that could be used to basically take care of any and all house work.</br></br></br></br>  Best girl or just a useless drunk goddess?  <br>That's a pretty good point—I never thought about it.<br>You clearly have control over the spell after using it, but what then? It's never clear how much control you have over a spell after casting it, and what you'd have to learn to gain better control.<br>Nanahoshi basically said that people in that world don't really work on creating new magic circles, and the same probably applies to voiced spells—and then you have to wonder how they learned those spells to begin with (I know they said they got it from the Elves, but they never explained it)<br><br>It sorta just feels like a plot-hole now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is there anyone know the name of this LN? It's about a guy who is a chuuninbyou neet and then he got hit by a truck and died. And then he reincarnated into a village girl in a fantasy world and she vow to stop being a chuunin and live a normal life. Until she heard that her little sister claimed herself as one of the Demon's General.  <br>I haven't read it myself, but sounds like Tilea's Worries<br>https://oniichanyamete.wordpress.co<wbr>m/index/tileas-worries/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yes, that LN.

Human's aren't supposed to have Reality Marbles. Stuff like Alexander and Nero are specifically Noble Phantasms gained after death, not abilities they had as humans. They're actually only supposed to be a Demon's ability, but some other Dead Apostles and Elementals cheat as well. The Head of the Clock Tower is over 2000 years old but he (as well as everyone else there) hasn't managed to attain a Reality Marble, hence why Shirou would get a Sealing Designation on the spot.</br>  <br>I find it odd that Avalon doesn't recognize Shirou as a new owner of it not needing to be Saber's Master and all.</br>  <br>I know the implications might seem obvious, but there's that little visual cue there that I just thought was neat.<br><br>It's kind of hard to point it out without a gif or a webm.</br></br></br>  <br> Hero Creation Kit&gt;All of them&gt;Ea&gt;Excalibur&gt;Gay Bulge </br>  <br>You're making a faulty jump of logic. It's said that Shirou's alignment and origin are sword (and that Avalon made his alignment sword, it never mentions his origin in relation to it), and he's shit at all non sword magic as a result, but in exchange he is able to manifest his Reality Marble Unlimited BLade Works. Nowhere does that mean someone else with Avalon would have their alignment and origin become sword or whether he's specifically malleable to that from the start, and nowhere does it say someone else with that alignment and origin would get Unlimited BLade Works and be able to manifest it, just that he was. Shirou's circuits are explicitly in the game stated to be specialized to manifest Reality Marbles as well.</br>  Today's the day.  <br>No need for stupid rigid, things like  or some sort of anti-zombie agent being used don't require the military to be stupid or rigid.</br>  <br>Oh, that sounds neat.
