Why the hell do you watch this shit  <br>This show is perfectly heterosexual, anon</br>    <br>I feel like Killua has a defined relationship with everyone in the main cast except for Kurapika. It seems like Kurapika only cares about Killua because his friends do, and visa versa. I wish there would be an arc where they spend some time together to develop a rapport.</br>  <br> he thinks BnP is just a meme <br> he doesn't know people watch it for the plot </br></br>  <br>fucking normies</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Watching that shit for the plot<br>Nope</br></br>    <br>Kurapika is smart and knows not to associate with shitty people, which is why he prefers Gon and Leorio.</br>  <br>You forgot to green text newfriend.</br>  <br>Holy fucking shit.

I'm just worried they're going to censor THE SHIT out of Prison School. Even in the manga I didn't expect the yuri scene, but damn was it a good fap.

Regardless, knowing about it wont tarnish the scene too much. You know it's coming you just don't know when, or the why.</br>  <br>Cowtits banzai!</br>   Hiroshi Kamiya (Levi in Attack on Titan) <br><br>What the fuck?<br><br>Why not say Arararagi when Kiyoshi is literally Ararararagi 2.0</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I mean i'm 20 chapters away from being caught up so I have no need to spoil myself by skipping just to fap. <br><br><br>But youtube doesn't do that automatically, at least I don't think it does.<br><br><br>You don't need to spoil that in a thread that's mainly composed of people who are caught up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Attack on titan was horrible in terms of writing, but not as horrible as monogatari series.<br><br>Think of it like this, its less monotone.<br>Infact thats closer to what it should be named, monotonegatari. a boring story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>France are bigger weebs than americans will ever be</br>   Levi (Attack on Titan) <br> not Zetsubou Sensei IN PRISON </br>  <br>You heard one Kamiya role, you heard them all.</br>  <br>As if that's a bad thing, I love his voice in anything he's in.</br>  <br>I have a better chance learning french and moving to France than staying in America hoping for more localizations and people who like the same kind of anime as me</br>  <br>You're a fucking moron.</br>  <br>You can tell by your brilliant retort to the points made how nonmoronic you are and how moronic those who agree on said points are.</br>  <br> namefag <br>Go attention whore on some other site.</br></br>  <br> Prison schoorrr <br>HAHA OH LAWD!<br><br><br>Compare the animation with the manga, hopefuly it will get better.</br></br></br></br></br>  Prison school's censorship in Japanese's street  <br>What's up with the random shading on the colors? I really don't like it.</br>  <br>Kamiyan fucked up Manlet, but he is Zetsubou Sensei, he is perfect for Kiyoshi.</br>  I'm guessing this is going to be a guarantied hit regardless of the studio or people behind it since the manga is so popular  <br>Are you nuts?The anime will cover the first arc, or perhaps only till the date with chiyo.</br>  <br>It's airing at the same time and channel as Triage X did. Take that as you will.</br>  <br>they can't censor this show as much as they did with Triage X because it isn't about action but about comedy that rely on comedy</br>  <br>Chiyo has bigger breasts than Hana?</br>  <br>random what now? would you kindly explain for those who dont understand colour theory completly.</br>  <br>I think, everyone except risa, and the boys minus andre has bigger breasts than hana</br>  <br>Yes but Hana has a better ass.</br>  <br><br>Isn't it obvious who is going to lose then? He is a Titsman.</br></br>  <br>As long as he's not a shitty tsunderefag, she's toast anyway.<br>He literally called their last experience together "well, at least it's better than shit"</br></br>  <br>that's a great picture of it</br>  <br>Those tits are deadly weapons.</br>  <br>I know.</br>  <br> Katsuyuki Konishi <br>Muh dick</br></br>  <br>Well I mean just look at the faces or shit. the darkness/lightness varies for no reason. Look at this image more closely, do you see what I mean?</br>  Am I the only one who finds Risa to be really cute? Both in looks and in personality I think she's cute. I like how hard she tries to make Andre happy  I wish she was interested in another character though   <br>so much ass on the screen it's unreal</br>  <br>She is easily best girl.<br>She's actually one of the best girls in manga overall.<br>Decides who she wants.<br>Gets over her embarrassment.<br>Is open about the fact she wants to do stuff with him.<br>Tries to improve for his sake.<br>When the average girl -in this manga and in general- would blush/freak out/lash out at kinky stuff, she not only goes through with it, she has him tell her "no, you failed" in her face, accepts it and tries to learn from his advice.<br><br>She's beyond perfect.<br>Seriously, compared to the rest of the cast, it's not even funny. The rest are either totally clueless -with possibility of upcoming dark side- or nasty cunts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know she is trying to be like Meiko? Too bad the real version is always better than the copy so..</br>  <br> Subs when? <br><br>It's not airing yet retard.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet on best boy andre to settle this and choose risa in the cavalry even after meiko awakes. Risa is miles better than meiko, she's trying to please her man. We don't even know if meiko likes men.</br>  <br> He is a Titsman <br>Blasphemy!</br></br>  <br>If being an assman leads you to be like principal-kun, then being a titman is the right choice.</br>  <br>Thank you, anon. I don't feel ashamed of my Risa love anymore</br>  <br>Being an Assman is what brought about the Principal's rise to power. The ravages of time dulling his senses is what brought about his downfall. Being an Assman is what will lift him back up.</br>  <br>There's literally no reason to be.<br>She's anything I ever wanted and couldn't find in manga girls.<br>Upfront without being pushy, accommodating without being a doormat , eager for kinky stuff while being loyal, loving and devoted.<br>A best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga, this man has done some major fuck ups that we don't know about.<br>Either he lets his daughter treat him like that for no reason, which is a fuck up.<br>Or he has done some really bad stuff and ruined his family, so he lets her act like that out of guilt.<br>Either way, major fuck ups.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon this is exactly how I feel. Only reason I don't talk about Risa is because I feel like she is completely overshadowed by the other female characters. I mean I like literally every important character in Prison School but Risa is the best.</br>  <br> overshadowed <br>well, narrative wise, hana and chiyo are the mc bowl fighters, kate and mari are the antagonists and meiko is the fanservice.<br>But quality wise she overshadows them, easily. Which is a good thing. Let the other fight over screen time, she'll be on the sidelines with her fat husbando.<br>Seriously, that scene when she wanted to cuddle a bit after she managed to subdue him. <br>Wow.<br>As a  dom  I was really touched.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. It wasn't always like that. Remember the Meiko flashback? Remember how proud Mari was of her father? The manga starts after Assman's decline. What we've seen is a man who had lost his way, one who no longer had the courage to stand tall and bare it all. His faith had faltered.<br>Andre and Meiko aren't the only ones who need reawakening. The true Assman has lain dormant for years, and only now is he starting to re-emerge.</br></br>  hana is literally worst girl  <br>Yes.<br>And he'll awaken with mc's help.<br>Who is a titman.<br>He'll help assman realise that both tits and ass are great and one most love everything a woman has to offer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never thought I'd say this, but Meiko's tits are too big.</br>  <br> worst girl <br> when pick related exists </br></br>  <br>Worst = Most interesting</br>  You can't really get the same quality out of the manga if its going to be animated. Sure it will make a ton of money but it looks like shit and feels like selling out. I guess integrity means nothing in Japan.  Kiyoshi is literally best girl.  Do you think it'll live up to the manga  <br>I meant overshadow as in nobody noticed her and payed more attention to the others.</br>    <br>I think it looks fine besides the random burning like  said and how Meikos tits are handled, they don't look the same as in the manga, imo. Plus that fucking VA cast though<br><br><br>Only if it isn't censor or remove any scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>being a slut is key to winning the kiyoshibowl</br>  <br>That voice cast is perfect.</br>  <br> Mari Kurihara: Sayaka Ohara <br>What the fuck? She would've been better as Meiko.</br></br>  <br>How is she a slut? Her heart and mind has only been for Kiyoshi.</br>  <br><br>Not gonna lie, while i was reading the manga i always read Kiyoshi's lines with Yato's voice, from Noragami. They looked so similar that it was almost impossible not to.</br></br>  I've finally read Part 4 and I have to say it was really fucking good. Seriously why was it so fucking good? I mean the fact it had lots of sol shenanigans was so good. Also it felt fresh that Main Villain wasn't a guy that wanted to take over the world but one that just wanted a peaceful life. Kira was a goddamn amazing Villain. I don't know why people think Dio is great Villain when you have a character like Kira who was clever, cunning, and intelligent as fuck. He felt more complex than Dio could ever be. The Stands were far more creative and dangerous than Part 3 too. Part 4 was so much better than Part 3.<br><br>I really want David Productions to animate the Italian Restaurant arc so bad now. Delicious animated Italian food.</br></br>  I'm on Volume 39 right now and struggling to finish it. I'm only reading it for Jotaro. Too much hype.  <br>Finished it recently as well, and enjoyed it immenselly. One thing that bothered me was why Josuke never tried using Crazy Diamond on Okuyasu's dad.</br>  <br>How come? <br><br>Also Josuke is so much better than Jotaro.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a break from the usual formula. Colorful characters of all sorts of shapes and sizes, expressive art, humor, and a lack of urgency gave it a much more relaxed tone.</br>  It's arguably the best part out of the first 6 parts of JoJo. I usually say that's the point where shit gets really "bizarre". Instead of just a straight up shonen gauntlet<br>You should give the Rohan related spinoffs a read as well when you're finished.</br>  I loved the fact that Part 4 had a alien.  <br>I'll finish part 4 first then come back if this thread is still active.</br>  <br>I just finished reading Part 4 yesterday and the more I think about it, the more I dislike it. A lot of things were introduced but were never fleshed out. Josuke was introduced as having enough potential to make Jotaro back off, but he really only shows up half the time. Many characters are introduced and just hang around not doing anything. The crew aren't concerned about Kira or the Arrow as much as they should, so this part didn't have a strong main plot.  I actually just want more Part 1 and 2. <br><br>That said, what I liked was that when Josuke had his cool moments, he had them with style.</br></br></br>  Woah. It's almost as if there's a reason people tell animeonlys that Part 4 is excellent and to read the manga.  <br>Yeah it was alright, a shame  Reimi was a mega slut though. </br>  <br>he wasn't an alien, just a mentally challenged kid with great fashion sense</br>  <br>I think it's because there's nothing to "heal" there. Crazy Diamond can heal someone of their injuries, but something like Dio's cells going haywire would be a whole different level. It says CD can't heal diseases, so it might fall under that, too.</br>  Part 4 is really good, it's my second favorite part after 7. It's the first part where it feels like Araki knew what he wanted to do with the series, and it gains a feel totally unique. Josuke's great too.    Araki never managed to work in Josuke going back in time and saving himself.<br><br>It's shit.</br></br>  <br>if he was an alien then his ability wouldn't have a stand name</br>  <br>My negro of comparable tastes. I think mid and late Part 4 was Araki's best art style as well.</br>  <br><br><br>it was intentionally ambiguous</br></br></br>  Who the fuck is Josefumi really with those shit ass eyes?  <br>I know it was meant to be ambiguous, but he's clearly a stand user<br><br>if he's an alien then he's related to the arrow meteor</br></br></br>  IF IT DOESN'T HAVE MICKEY, THAT SHIT AIN'T DISNEY!  <br>Just another mystery to add to the pile that have been introduced and still not solved for this part.</br>  <br>damn, that looks pretty damn good</br>  <br>Someone needs to compile a list of mysteries Araki has introduced but hasn't solved and ones we actually know by now.</br>  <br>He's the other half. It's said outright, isn't it?</br>  <br>I liked how you had this gang set up the whole way through. Instead of the plot starting up and the story saying "here are your allies, go fuck shit up," most of the enemies in Part IV ended up joining the gang. You had this buildup where the core Josuke-Jotaro-Koichi grew into a big movement of a bunch of stand users who were all tangled up in Kira's web.<br><br> Yukako best girl </br></br></br>  <br>If he's the other half, why aren't Jo2uke's eyes bright/dark instead of dark/darker?</br>  <br>I just adore late part 7. People cry sameface a lot, and maybe they're right, but it doesn't diminish the gorgeous art.</br>  <br><br>Koichi is the best girl</br></br>  <br>The color went to the other half of the fusion, that being the corpse that was identified as Kira.</br>  <br>Anyone have a screenshot of Kira's eyes?<br><br>I think i remember them being white, but I assumed that was because he was dead.<br><br>Whatever, I'll just take your word for it, makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I liked more Golden Wind &amp; Stone Ocean though</br>  <br>Just finished the manga, and they're right, especially in covers, Johnny and Gyro had the exact same fucking face<br><br>it was hilarious when Steel compared Lucy and the first lady as if you couldn't do that with every fucking character that part, clearly hot pants was behind this</br></br></br>  <br> liking part 5 <br>holy shit how is this even possible<br>it had the most hardcore and menacing stands, but that and bruno were the only good parts</br></br></br>  <br><br> not liking Mista </br></br>  <br>oh yeah I forgot about him, he was cool too, couldn't save the part tho</br>  How would you react if David responded to the "WHERE'S PART 4 TEASER" bitching and moaning by filling the blu-ray release of the Egypt arc with awkwardly spliced in scenes of Dio describing the Bow and Arrow in great detail, shots of Dio's baby sons, an unassuming white haired black man standing in the corner of every scene, and an entire extra episode devoted to babby shit-hair in the snowstorm?  <br> an entire extra episode devoted to babby shit-hair in the snowstorm? <br>wait, what is that?</br></br>  <br>Did you read Part 4?</br>  <br>oh you mean josuke, carry on<br>I didn't understand because his hair is perfect</br></br>  <br>so what happened to the invinsible baby</br>  <br> an unassuming white haired black man standing in the corner of every scene <br> It's official now that Gay Priest will never have a cameo in the SDC adaption <br> No Gay Priest animu until at least 2020. </br></br></br>  <br>Joseph adopted it</br>  <br>that baby grew up to be giorno, giving him yet more bullshit powers that don't get used, and making him even more of a mary sue<br><br>just making shit up, honestly invisibility is kind of a terrible power, so we'll never know</br></br></br>    Just finished Part VI and damn, I love Foo Fighters.  <br>He can fucking transform into shoes, though. How is that ambiguous?</br>  <br> reading it for jotaro <br>Hes one of the worst jojos though</br></br>  Am I the only one who got discouraged every time he checked the list of chapters and their names?<br> [STAND] PART 16 <br>It would instantly make me stop reading for a while, except for DIO and pretty much every fight in Part 4.<br><br>I'm struggling to finish Bohemian Rhapsody now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aliens could have transformation powers, too</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying; he's an alien. There's no doubt about that.</br>  <br>this late part 7 is best, part 8 has darker outlines and the art generally seems rougher</br>  <br>Well, there's also a stand that made Kenshiro come alive and terrorize Tokyo. It could be either, honestly.</br>  Can someone fucking explain Underworld to me?  There was a screenshot of some jap's twitter with anime-styled part four art, anyone have it? I'm assuming it's not legit.  <br>It's because part 8 has Ultra Jump scans while every other part has tank scans, and the scan quality itself varies wildly from chapter to chapter too.</br>  <br><br>It brings back the memories of the land it activates on irrc. The whole plane scene was making it reality and crashing Jolyne and everyone else in it. Or my loose interpretation of it.</br></br>  <br><br>So you could say that Versace was crashing the plane with no survivors?</br></br>  <br><br>That and using a football team to further the insanity of his stand.</br></br>  <br>It's a ruse by Doc.</br>  <br>I get what you mean but what's tank scans? like scanning the volume instead of the weekly release? or some online source?<br><br><br>well kind of like how certain things that you have bring about memories of certain things, underworld can pretty much use anything and bring back memories in evokes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Could Underworld re-enact 9/11?</br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of, how did Hermes use Kiss to hide both her and Jolyne in the bodies of the passengers who survived? I thought her stand only seperated shit with stickers, and when taken off it smashed shit together, hurting the person.</br></br>  <br>you have to wait for part 7 something like part 1 and 2 again<br><br>but it's worf the wait.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and some idiots took it for truth and spread it all over the place  I saw three posts about it on reddit, all 3 i'm going to assume got the info from tumblr or facebook </br>  <br><br>She doubled the passenger and she and Joleyne hid in the hollow between the two doubles and Joleyne stitched the doubles together with string<br><br>I think</br></br></br></br>  <br> like scanning the volume instead of the weekly release? <br>Well, monthly in this case, but yeah. By tank I meant tankobon.</br></br>  <br>something about that seems really iffy to me<br><br>then again I hated all of DIO's shitty sons and that stupid arc so who knows</br></br></br>  What the fuck was so dangerous about the snails that Weather Report made?  <br>if you touched one you became one</br>  <br>i see, my apologies i have never heard the term tankobon.<br><br><br>yes, and if it's anything like bohemian rhapsody then the whole world will see it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>or just by looking at the sky/anywhere.<br><br>Pucci took out his sight during the battle to combat this.</br></br></br>  <br><br>that would be pretty cool actually</br></br>  Why didn't Underworld just bring King Crimson back? Or even Dio?  <br>it brought back a football player but all he did was make a catch, doubt it can bring people back fully just projections. plus i don't think he even knows about them<br><br><br>you can only defend against it if you're blind, which makes it almost impossible to fight against weather.<br><br>if you're fighting him and touch a snail you become a snail, if you touch a rainbow you explode into snails, and if you get caught in a reflection of extra bright light snails start growing on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, but what's wrong with being a snail?</br></br>  <br>well for starters there were tons of bugs eating people because of the ability, i doubt anyone wants to be eaten alive by insects.</br>  <br><br>I'd just use my stand to kill the bugs.</br></br>  <br> The rainbows even hypnotized the bugs <br>Whoa.</br></br>  <br>duh</br>  <br>you can't even figure out how an ability works by reading it in the manga, if you had a stand i'm sure you wouldn't get very far with it unless you were spoonfed. like the guy who had sky high</br>  <br><br>What if my Stand's ability was to kill all insects within a 10m radius of myself and it was an automatic Stand?</br></br>  <br>then your stand could get you a job, nice</br>  <br>kind of ironic that you said that, since sky high is kind of similar to that stand you just made up.</br>  <br><br>Do you think you could use Sky High's rods as dildos?<br><br>I mean, assuming they didn't suck your energy out.</br></br></br></br>  Which Stand would be most dangerous to have sex with?<br><br>What Stand would YOU want to fuck?</br></br>  <br>Purple Haze or the Hand<br>Spice Girl</br></br>  What would Jotaro think of Jonathan?  <br>tags<br>hermit purple:all the way through</br></br>  If C-Moon touched your dick, would it turn into a vagina?

It was basically a copy of part 2, if you boil everything down. Are people just really gay for cowboys or something? The added Dio fanservice at the end was honestly just insulting, if you're going to bring him back, at least make it a neat fight instead of "lol check out your head in this bag bro".<br><br>It's a decent part. Top 3. Is it just having an ending that doesn't suck or consist of a total deus ex machina for the first time since part 2? Because the journey is more important than the destination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the anime didn't use shitty photoshop texture filters</br>  <br>Pic related.<br><br>Your autism is showing.</br></br></br>  <br>As someone who finished part 7 this morning, part 4 and 7 were both really good but I liked 7 a lot because of<br><br> "rustic"/"cheap" stands instead of the constant sci-fi shit we had in part 6-5, obviously excluding mandom and D4C <br> za warudo tweest <br> a protagonist that doesn't mind killing people <br> great art (shame about sameface) <br> interesting characters <br> spin being a great counterpart to hamon <br> realism (somewhat) <br> actual character development <br><br>Part 4 is still probably my second favorite though, it has a few of the above plus a really good villain</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  is there an album or rar of all the inbetween chapter sketches?

Then they all play baseball.<br>Or it's a bunch of Alternate Reality versions...still playing baseball.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why he needs his own TP specialist.</br>  <br>Is anime at end of part3?<br>How do they slice it up?<br>Dio's kill</br></br></br>  <br> The manga has been out since the eighties <br> There are people who still haven't just went on Batoto and read it <br><br>I don't understand, Then again the lamest excuse i heard was "Lol its not moving so i can't get into it XDDDD".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not against reading, I love manga.<br>Why did it take them so long to animate though?</br></br>  <br><br>they did do the OVA back in the 90s or something. Then there was (or maybe before, idk) that terrible Phantom Blood movie thing which both araki and everybody else hated, so maybe people backed off from Jojo to be safe? I'm making shit up lol</br></br>  How did Kira even know what Bites the Dust could do if he can't remember anything about the loop? How did he even discover it? Did the arrow give him an instruction booklet or something?  The sol parts of Part 4 killed it for me. I mean if I want to read slice of life I read something like Bonnouji and if I want some le delinquent action I read something like Crows. <br>The balance between sol and stand action was so fucking ruined in DwK. Those who unironically liked it, I am sorry for your shit taste.</br>  <br>You mean Josuke.</br>  <br> reading it for autism: the jojo </br>  <br>Because Araki is awesome and refused many adaptations since they were doing a shitty job. You wanted JoJo adapted by Toei or Pierrot?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>The fact that he could see stands proves it wasn't a stand ability.

Was he dead? He wasn't? His body was dead but his spirit wasn't? How the hell did he do that?</br>  <br>Ohh, that makes sense, since Josuke has his pupils too right?</br>  <br>Watch that be Josefumi</br>  <br>crack cocaine<br><br>Giorno resurrected him somehow, or at least healed his body and then Bucciarati's will was so strong that he was able to return to it or something idk but he became a zombie and KC eventually destroyd his body beyond repair so he died again&gt;?</br></br></br>  <br>Won't be that long.</br>  <br>fuck you lol</br>  <br>yeah i love that bitch too</br>  <br>Short attention span. You probably have dyslexia too.</br>  <br> browsing reddit unironically and pretending we'll let that shit pass if you put it in a spoiler <br>Even /a/ is dead</br></br>  <br>I heard they can have sex with anything they touch.</br>  Highway star needs an OVA budget  <br>yeah well i heard you fucked a frog</br>  <br> yfw it's all in CG </br>  <br> doesn't consist of a total deus ex machina <br> part 2 <br>did you forget the volcano that conveniently shot Kars into space?</br></br></br>  <br>So go back to .</br>  <br> part 2 <br> not deus ex machina: the series </br></br>  <br>Do we get first dibs if the stands become a reality? I'll take Stone Free.</br>  <br>I wouldn't even fucking care if it was CG by the dudes who did the 20 second opening they could make a 12 minute episode and I would nut all over the place. In fact not even the whole arc but just the scene with the baby and the motorcycle if that was done in CG from the guys who make the opening that should would be fucking amazing.</br>  <br> censored beetle lick <br>Even the gooks believe in sasuga david</br></br>  <br>then go back to reddit.</br>  <br> Jo-Jo <br>Man I've heard a lot of shit but this is brand new to me</br></br>  <br> part 5 is adapted <br> yfw Risotto vs Doppio </br></br>  <br>He made it</br>  <br><br>I meant *couldn't. fucking chill</br></br>  <br>I couldn't find the chapter when I tried looking for it but during Giorno's backstory it revealed that as a kid he saved a gangster who was being tracked down, so to repay him he started telling the people around him to respect him. There's a theory it's Diavolo.</br>  <br> Unbreakable <br>Isn't the right name for it 'Diamond is not Crash' ?</br></br>  <br> you now realize that with the cheap production of CG, they could make early adaptations of later parts right the fuck now </br>  <br>That was the duwang title. The series was always called Diamond wa kurenai or some shit like that in Japan.</br>  <br>Except you haven't meant it.</br>  <br>I fucking did. My argument only works with that correction dumbass.<br><br>What the fuck is wrong with this thread's quality?</br></br></br>  <br>Summer</br>  When I look at Abbacchio all I see is Sephiroth  <br>ESTUANS INTERIUS <br>IRA VEHEMENTI <br>ESTUANS INTERIUS <br>IRA VEHEMENTI <br> SEPHIROTH  <br> SEPHIROTH </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ohh now I remember, thanks!<br>pretty interesting theory. unfortunately there's not really any evidence pointing one way or another that I can think of, so in the end it's whether you want to believe it or not versus how ridiculous it sounds. I wonder what Araki would think of it</br></br>  What if D4C finds an alternate universe in which it's Za Warudo Dio Only Knows?  <br>You mean exactly what happened?</br>  <br> I see what you did there.</br>  <br>I dont get it</br>  Part 7 is terrible at least because this is a part in which at least 3 Dios died  <br>Dio = God in Italian</br>  Remember guys only one who is capable of tanking Tusk Act 4 is Diavolo as he is not part of his predictions thus cannot be affected by anything happening in the skipped time. Act 4 is bound to dimensions so it cannot chase Diavolo in the skipped time.  <br>Oh, I just didn't get the reference</br>  <br>TWGOK</br>  Semen. Semen. Semen, is she.<br>Semen. Semen. Semen, to me.</br>  <br>Was I seriously the only one who understood corpse parts only let you get an stand no matter what, but if you *earn* the stand then you get to keep it?</br>  <br>It makes sense I guess but it's ambiguous to me how Johnny earned his stand over Gyro. Did it have to do with Johnny being handicapped at all?</br>  <br> SO <br> everything in the solitary confinement ward <br>   c-moons ability is to censor upon contact </br></br></br>  Part 4 is just so comfy and fun. What compelled Araki go in that direction?  <br>He just wanted quiet life.</br>  <br><br>I figured he just had characters that went through a long journey going to Egypt, he wanted to do a story arc where things aren't as intense.<br><br>Half the time, reading part 4 felt like an SoL.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing about that always gets to me.<br>When the fuck was a US fighter pilot shot down by a Russian MIG over Florida?<br>Some kind of sekret Cuban skirmish, or something? Fuck if I know.</br></br></br>  <br>It only has an active range over Florida.<br><br> Besides, Diavolo would just die again. </br></br></br>  <br>Have you read Uzumaki, anon?</br>   5 JoJo threads in the catalog <br>Did DiU get confirmed or something?</br>  <br>New Chapter got translated.</br>  <br>Because they're all about something different in jojo</br>  <br>Koichi really visits reddit?<br>NO DIGNITY!!</br></br>  <br>The sad thing is that they really think all the "le go back to reddit" shit is just a dank meme or something, they seriously can't imagine anyone not browsing a piece of shit site that solely covers heavily filtered content.</br>  Okay I just finished part 4 and what the fuck was up with present day Josuke saving himself and his mother in the past during the snowstorm.<br><br>I figured some shit was going to happen during his fight with Kira where either he literally 'fixed' the universe to go back or Bites the Dust would cause time travel shenanigans but it just never got adressed.<br><br>What gives?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally only getting your information about reddit from 4chan. </br>  <br> literally understanding less about the site you spend most of your day on than someone who never goes there <br>As expected from Reddit.</br></br>  <br>Oh boohoo they got rid of hate subreddits boohoo. Who the fuck cares? I go to reddit for discussions about certain interests, news, and for porn</br>  <br>Probably Araki originally had a plan that Kira went back in time to kill Josuke or set up killing him and Josuke got caught in it as well and saved himself. Then Araki went fuck it and ran Kira over with a ruck.</br>  <br>Sounds like some other time travel movie I've heard before.</br>  <br>If they ever make a part 4 anime this is the one thing I'd be okay with them changing.<br><br>Even something like  suggested would be better than what we got.</br></br></br>  <br>This is exactly what I was talking about. So utterly clueless that he can't imagine anyone not using Reddit.<br><br>It's a piece of shit site. I don't give a fuck about some "hate subreddit" bullshit, what matters is that all the content is heavily policed and filtered so only the most popular opinions are ever seen.<br><br>The fact that you actively want other people to police your thoughts under the guise of convenience means you are totally ill-suited to browse a site built designed around freedoms. You cannot even comprehend the concept of the word "freedom". There is no reason for you to be here aside from jerking off over how much of an epic troll you are for pretending to be retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  How many viagra pills Joseph had to take in order to impregnate Josuke's mom?  <br>Why can't you guys accept that it's just random high schooler with a huge pompadour that just wanted to help someone? Instead, you just insert these time travel plots.</br>  <br> I don't know why people think Dio is great Villain <br>because hes a likable jerk<br><br> Seriously why was it so fucking good <br>the SoL format make the fights seems less fillers<br>Kira is the best vilain beside part 7 vilain<br>josuke was a total bro and the whole cast was hilarious<br>jotaro works better as a mentor<br>it has the best art by far in the whole serie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the funniest thing i've read today. I can't take you seriously when you're basing this all from the shit you've read on 4chan and have never used it yourself. You can actually go to /new/ and see the newest posts that have been made regardless of the amount of votes.</br>  <br>thats great whoever made this</br>  <br>why is jojo so quotable</br>  <br>Because he's literally drawn the same as Josuke, is extremely mysterious, and the way he was inserted into the story heavily indicates later importance - it being never adressed again is just a shit payoff for what looked to be foreshadowing for something big.</br>  <br>Wow, one board has enough mods to offer such a basic feature.<br><br>Of course, you aren't actually seeing the newest posts. Anything that is particularly hated by the constant moderation team will be deleted before it even gets added to the "newest" pile.</br></br></br>  <br>After reading about the alien, do you expect any more?</br>  <br>It's pretty clearly just a storyline that Araki decided not to bother with.</br>  <br>I completely agree, but it was still a shit payoff.</br>  <br>I'm totally sick of pre-destination timetravel shit. It's better without it.</br>  <br>I just saw flashbacks as a nice explanation as to why Josuke gets pissed when you insult his hair. Nothing more than that.</br>  <br> the constant moderation team will be deleted <br>Are you literally this retarded? You don't know shit about reddit. I would suggest actually try it for about a week or two but i'm guessing you'll go on it and not even attempt to search and explore other subreddits and call it shit.</br></br>    <br>I hate to break it to you but while yes pages will get deleted by moderators. When sorting by new you just see the most recent things. This is not the default though and most posts are ignored or downvoted because people disagree so most people will never see them. Filters can also prevent shit I'm sure but that is probably about the same as a word filter.<br><br>This is why reddit is fucking shit. Took 15 minutes of using the site to figure this out. At least say why it is shit for the right reasons.</br></br></br>   Japan loves the Assassination Squad a lot to the point where even Pesci gets love. <br> Nobody in the West gives a damn except for the fights they were in. </br>    <br><br>10/10</br></br>    <br>New isn't on by default because that's not the general point of reddit. It's supposed to bring you "the best content" by using some kind of algorithm by amount of votes plus how recent the post is or something.</br>  <br>Precisely why reddit is trash. Just because "new" exists doesn't mean it is widely used.</br>  Why did part 7 have Dio win only to lose anyways because of a dirty trick? Just to prove that time-stop really is the strongest stand power after Jotaro proved himself king of jobbers in part 6?  <br>If new wasn't used that much than nobody would vote on posts and those posts wouldn't get to the front page.</br>  <br>You forget that comments work the same way which is another large issue. Unpopular comments are downvoted immediately. This means they have less visibility to most users.</br>    <br>True but you actually can filter comments by oldest, newes, or even controversial (comments that have a near equal amount of downvotes and upvotes.<br><br>I don't think they'll let you sort by comments or posts with the most downvotes because that might encourage people to downvote those posts even more than they already are. In a way you could say that downvoted comments or posts having less visibility is good because if they were more visible then people would just downvote them even more</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't Josuke. It was just a guy with a pomp.</br>  <br>Exactly that guy looks like Josuke because Josuke copied his style since he look up to the guy that saved him and his mother.Now get over it.</br>  <br><br>It´s not Josuke, and he styled his  cool  hair in honor of that guy.</br></br>  Last night I had a dream where I had sex with Gappy.  <br>Fuck off Karera</br>  <br>He has the same face and clothes as well.<br><br>It was definitely josuke.

Or at least it wouldn't be for me. Adoption because you have no family or they're dysfunctional and you can't stay with them is one thing. But, what, so you get a better standing in society? For a job? It's still bizarre to me. I'm going to chalk it up to cultural differences.</br>  <br>Happening!</br>  <br>You are likely to succeed if you try.</br>  <br><br>I finally managed to get the cat ver. in game so I could test it and fixed some mistakes and typos in the script, here's the latest version http://www.mediafire.com/download/1<wbr>9e5xceax56ffe6/script.dat.</wbr></br></br>  <br>It's a thing in pretty much every society except the modern day individualist West. A man of high status adopting someone as an heir, when the natural ones proved a disappointment, for example -- in those cases, the adoptee would often be an adult with a good track record. Like a CEO hiring in a replacement, really.</br>  <br>I'd hire them.</br>  <br> Drove 3 Vertexes out of the barrier solo <br> -- Sonoko needed 20 mankais to do the same <br>Based on what happened in the Vita game, Leo later fused with other Vertices and evolved to Cluster Leo (Nightmare form) so Sonoko actually had to solo at least 6 Vertices. Remember that Cluster Leo wiped out the entire Hero Club before they were able to trap it in the sealing ritual, and sealing function didn't exist back when Sonoko fought it.</br></br></br>  <br>Leo is broken.<br>I always wondered why that one in particular, is it because the Lion symbolizes kingship and power?</br></br>  <br> the adoptee would often be an adult <br>Yeah, but Tougou was 12 when she was adopted. I guess I'm just more sentimental than Washi.</br></br>  What if the teory about the returned offerings being parts of dead yuushas is correct and Karin last Mankai made her lose her taste and that's why when she met Sonoko she liked soy sauce gelato so much.  <br>She was around 10 years old, she said she was named Washio Sumi during the 2 years of lost memory because of sange.</br>  <br>That would explain why the recovery process took so long.<br>But it's most likely just us and Tougou overthinking again.</br></br>  <br>Karin didn't say she likes soy sauce gelato, she likes soy sauce udon which is pretty normal.</br>  Everything else aside, which series had the better final fight? Zero's batcave brawl or UBW's temple showdown?<br><br><br> Shirou vs Gilgamesh <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F_5<wbr>Q0QDaH5w</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Kirei vs Kerry <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NSg<wbr>XOZKSt20</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna say Zero, because even with all the magic time-stop and sword out of nowhere, it still felt a bit more grounded and intense. <br><br>Also, I didn't know the ending to Zero prior to watching it, so I guess it had more impact.</br></br></br>  I don't find the sword spam entertaining.  <br>In which fight? Both had it.</br>  <br>I'm sure you thought that was clever.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh. The only reason why /a/ doesn't like it was because they think too logically about the power levels.</br>  <br>No, I just through you were being unclear.</br>  <br>Do you think the degree of "sword spam" is equal in both scenes?</br>  <br>I'm going with Archer vs Shirou. I don't mind the changes from the VN.</br>  <br> magic time-stop <br>Are you stupid?</br></br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh was pretty much perfect.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh.<br><br>Swordspam fight is better than bulletspam fight.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, I didn't know the ending to Zero prior to watching it, so I guess it had more impact. <br>Secondary so fucking detected</br></br>  <br><br><br>lel, shiroufags are shit</br></br></br>  <br>Not in the anime</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh, how is this even a question? Better choreography, better animation, better action, not reusing a song we've heard in pretty much every battle in the series, and a much more satisfying resolution.</br>  <br><br/></br>  vs Gilgamesh &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shitty batcave fight &gt; vs Archer  <br>Zero. It was uninterrupted by dialogue, the combatants were evenly matched, tacticool, and as another anon said, it felt "grounded." When the fight consists of a swordspammer that quickly gets destroyed at close combat and a ninja ginger with no sense of weight in his movements, it gets boring fast.</br>  <br>the fight with EMIYA</br>  <br> It was uninterrupted by dialogue <br>I understand that you like ine more than the other, but that is a straight up lie. In Zero fight they were more inturrupted by dialogue and infodump, they even cut the fight like 5 times to focus on Saber and Berserker.<br>Also, both fights were about the same in tactical terms, the difference is that in UBW they mostly showed it.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean they didn't chat like faggots.</br>  <br>Zero's LN climax.</br>  <br>Kirei vs. Kerry. Gilgamesh spending most of the fight standing in place and exchanging swordspam like some fucking medieval Gundam SEED Destiny was fucking boring. It was only the final leg of the fight that was really entertaining.</br>  <br> I mean they didn't chat like faggots <br>Because IIRC in Fate/stay night Kirei told Shirou that they never spoke and tried to kill each other the very first time they met</br></br>  <br> Kirei vs Kerry didn't even have Emiya playing <br><br>It's shit</br></br></br>  <br> Implying Shirou vs Gil was the final fight <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bi8<wbr>tcTFdYOM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>All of UBW's fights got butchered in the second season, Zero wins easily.</br>  Of all places, why did Kerry go straight to the batcave?  <br> Kirei vs Kerry <br> anime fight <br> fast as fuck <br> Emiya ost <br> slow as fuck <br>Are you retarded? Anime fight and Drama CD fight are different</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Batcave was way more entertaining.<br>None of it beats Prisma though.</br>  <br>It was better in the anime actually.</br>  <br> because even with all the magic time-stop and sword out of nowhere <br><br>did you even watch the first half of the show?</br></br></br>  <br>Zero. UBW was underwhelming. Also development until the scenes was better handled for Zero.</br>  <br> They actually came up with a great version of Emiya <br> for the audio drama <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8kq<wbr>ls64aYUs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I want a series of Rin beating people up with reinforcement and martial arts</br>  <br>F/Z anime was inspired by "The Dark Knight".<br><br>Looks like 2anime4me.</br></br></br>  <br>It's amazing that a magical girl spinoff has better fight scenes than the anime adaptions of the main series.</br>  <br>Just make a fast-paced Emiya remix then. Better than hearing the same theme that they used in all the fights.</br>  Fate/zero characters had weight to them and made us give a shit. F/SN stuff just can't match to it.  <br>This fight is way overrated. It really wasn't that great.</br>  <br>This fight is so overrated. It's okay but nothing special.</br>  <br> Secondary so fucking detected <br>No shit Sherlock.<br>He practically admitted it.</br></br></br>  <br>I  agree  but only in terms of comparing the adaptations<br>The fight with Bazett was also pretty great, I hope they don't blow all their budget on fanservice so we can get decent  Bazett vs Gilgamesh  and  Double Kaleidostick Ilya vs Super-Gil  fights in Herz</br></br>  <br> Looks like 2anime4me. </br>  Why do we care about Shirou again, other than VNfags claiming superiority?  <br>He's the self-insert people don't want to admit that they self-inserted into.</br>  <br>He's an interesting character.</br>  <br>Shirou &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kerry</br>  <br>I was looking forward to FZ climax fight for so long but it was adapted so poorly.<br>Location change is terrible and boring. <br>Song use is atrocious and overdone.<br>QUALITY everywhere.<br><br>ufotable exceeded my expectation with UBW climax.<br>Perfect adaption <br>Perfect song use, all from the VN<br>Animation is high quality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Heaven's Feel can bring you into the light</br>   Batcave <br>Using strategy and several skills learned over a life time<br> Shirou vs Gil <br>MUH POWER-UP FROM MY FUTURE SELF THAT I CAN USE BECAUSE I FUCKED MY GIRLFRIEND<br><br>You tell me.</br></br></br></br></br>   Fate fight scenes <br><br>Anticlimactic to say the least.</br></br>   4:28 <br>People think this is good?</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br>Nanaya Shiki &gt; Ryougi Shiki &gt; Ryougi SHIKI &gt; Tohno Shiki &gt; HF Shirou &gt; shit &gt; UBW Shirou &gt; Kiritsugu &gt; Fate Shirou</br>  <br> I FUCKED MY GIRLFRIEND <br>Dolphins, anon.</br></br>  <br> Nanaya Shiki <br>The edgiest.</br></br>  <br>Oh wait I forgot the RN is the canon version now.</br>  <br>If its between muh edge and muh shounen, I'd much rather have the edge.</br>  <br> Now that I know you're moving at double speed, I'll simply adjust my timing to compensate <br><br>People think this shit is realistic?</br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br> not leading your punches </br>  <br>The only good fights in Zero were the Lancer vs Saber fights and the dogfight between Gil and Berserker.</br>  <br>Yes. It's basic magic. I even have a reality marble.</br>  <br>They're not real people anon</br>  <br> Using strategy and several skills learned over a life time <br> Kiritsugu survives his heart being blown up thanks to a magic item he never knew how to properly use the whole series saving his life and only then realizes how to use avalon allowing him to win <br> Kirei was only as strong as he was thanks to someone killing his dad allowing him to get his fathers command seals <br>They all had some kind of power up compared to normal in that fight. Even Gil had a body that let him act without a master.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nanya &gt; Ryougi <br>disdain_for_plebs.jpg</br></br>  <br>The Gil vs Berserker dogfight wasn't even a real fight. They just cut to a few seconds of CGI models zipping through the air once or twice an episode. There's non continuity, it's a cool concept that was squandered as time filler while Saber hogged the attention again.</br>  <br>Command seals are neato and everything, but it's pretty sad that Kiritsugu was making full use of an EX-rank noble phantasm and still could only fight Kirei to a draw.</br>  <br> implying there's anything wrong with focusing on Seiba </br>  Did I miss some kind of scene that setup the batcave?<br><br>All I remember was them getting prepped to finish this bullshit then they just magically showed up at the batcave, which was under where the grail was, I guess.</br></br>  Fuck Shirou and Kerry, Kirei should have been the protagonist  <br>Well he can't actually use its noble phantasm ability of teleporting to fairyland, which is the EX part. Healing is nice but it's not something that crazy.</br>  <br> full use <br>He wasn't completely invulnerable</br></br>  <br>No they just appeared there, it was weird.</br>  <br>Aoki is a faggot, that's why.</br>  <br>That's about it. It was an abrupt and senseless transition into the basement of whatever building they were supposed to be in.</br>  <br>When Gil used Ea and it was countered with Avalon, was fairyland destroyed?</br>  <br>What do you think?</br>  <br>What</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Alright then.</br>  Man, the OST really was the best part of zero.<br><br>EMIYA is a great track and all, but the UBW soundtrack in general doesn't hold a candle to the stuff Kajiura put out for zero. It's really a shame they didn't have her handle UBWs ost as well, because it was underwhelming.</br></br>  <br>Yes, that's why Shirou has Avalon now, the fairies got pissed at Saber for getting fairyland destroyed and gave it to Shirou instead.<br><br>That's why he kills Gil, for revenge for the fairies.<br><br>You have to really read behind the lines to see this though, it's all very subtle japanese symbolism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zero was less visually impressive, but had more meaning and better choreography.<br><br>UBW was a blast to watch, but came off as generic shounen fighting with pewpewpew and Shirou turning servant level.</br></br></br>  <br>The OST in the last three episodes was great.</br>  <br>Kerry is a fairy?</br>  <br>Zero and UBW had a different approach with their fighting scene since the beginning. It's just a matter of taste, "grounded" or over-the-top. Both are great though.<br><br><br> Archer vs Shirou <br>Did they even fight? I can only remember they were chit chatting so much it feels like i'm reading the VN all over again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, all the signs were there.</br>  <br>Fairytsugu</br>  <br>They did fight, but it was very briefly. The overall symbolism behind the entire thing was great, but aside from Shirou's charge up the hill it was plagued with poor animation quality and terrible choreography.</br>  <br>Hey</br>  <br> Did they even fight? <br>Yes, with terrible animation.</br></br>  <br>Alright, now post the ufotable one</br>  <br>in the original sources ubw is better. but that doesnt matter to people here</br>  <br>No one who has read the LN can call what Ufo did with Zero's last fight "good".<br>Shirou vs. Gil wins easily.</br></br>  <br>I legitimately don't understand why people keep posting this like it's the worst thing ever. It certainly doesn't look great but it's not terrible. It's more bad choreography choices than bad animation.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh is massively superior.</br>  <br><br>I feel like shirou fags are the same people who like bleach and think ichigo is a good character. Shirou is certainly one step ahead of bleach tier retardation but hes still well within the shallow end of the pool - like the entirety of the franchise that isn't zero.</br></br>  <br>Calm your tits, it will be fixed in the BDs</br>  <br> Shirou is obviously coming at me at full speed <br> Better stick out my arm so he can cut it off <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>For something from Ufotable, that is by far the worst action sequence in any TM work they've made, and it's especially damning after coming from episode 20.</br>  <br>He was in the middle of pulling out Ea, Shirou was just too fast.</br>  <br>I feel like Kerry fags are the same people who like Naruto and think Sasuke is a good character. Kerry is certainly one step ahead of Naruto tier edgyness but he's still well within the emo end of personalities - like the entirety of Zero's cast.</br>  <br> Gil is as fast as Archer at full power <br> Archer can dodge Shirou at 1/10th power <br> Gil can't move his arm fast enough <br>People will defend this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil vs Shirou also has a meaning since it is both; a way to show that Shirou resolution isn't just talking, and it also deals with the whole "fake ideals" thing that was introduced since the beginning.</br>  <br> Kirei vs Kerry <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rQF<wbr>fMyxa04A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Its sad that you make such a comparison without realizing how dumb it is. Zero is the only part of this franchize with any depth. Look at the banquet of kings, bluebeard and fagboy talking about god, or any of the other fantastic dialogues (comparatively - lets keep it real here this is all shit overall). UBW and the rest of this franchise has nothing. Nothing at all.</br></br>  <br> No one who has read the LN can call what Ufo did with Zero's last fight "good". <br>But going by that, anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good'.<br><br><br>Yeah, it's not bad. But honestly, it's really fucking bad compared to good fights like Saber vs Kojirou. People just focus on it because it's the climax of the route, yet had QUALITY.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is a reason why he is known as the king of jobbers.</br>  What I read/watched - expected - got thread  <br>You can. It has been discussed to death that it could have been translated much better. CR's translators are shit<br>Lancer meant the blow was obviously suppossed to be undodgeable, because nobody dodged it before. Yet Saver dodged it. You retards need everything spelled for you</br></br>  <br>The spanish translation was just fine.</br>  <br>Manga needs more Solaris, though. The Gauna stopped being creepy.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I give you a reply, will you be happy, shut up and go away?</br>  Why have I not seen any threads about this series? It's fun and the chapters come out every couple days  <br><br> working in the same company,  fuck, my and brushed against the submit button in the middle of that post.</br></br>  <br>Yup this things kind of end like that; but If a hack author did it. She'll remember her feelings for him; even though she hasn't meet him.</br>  <br>Looked into after I heard about it getting anime adaptation.<br><br>Has it's cute parts, but otherwise pretty dull drama. There's better stuff with the same premise out there.</br></br></br>  Terrible pacing and forced drama.
