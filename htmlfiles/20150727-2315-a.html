It had Starry in it and the three girls were idols in Akiba.</br>  <br>soruce?</br>  <br>Found it<br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=120211</wbr></br></br>  <br> In the gateverse it all took was some humane treatment to win over most of the gatepeople. <br>On the other hand, it made a peace treaty 100% harder. The Empire ended up mistaken Japan's desire for peace as a sign that the JSDF has major weaknesses. Because they don't understand why an army with such advantages don't just sack the Capital. Thus most assumed Japan is bluffing.</br></br>  <br>Well all it takes is just taking some high ranking people to show what Japan is like to convince them they're strong but desire peace. And they did exactly that.</br>  <br>That's actually really funny.</br>  <br> Because they don't understand why an army with such advantages don't just sack the Capital <br> tens of thousands of troops die in completely one-sided battles, with absolutely nothing to show for it <br> WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WINNING GUYS. LET'S GO IN FOR THE KILL. </br></br></br>  <br> &gt;tens of thousands of troops die in completely one-sided battles, with absolutely nothing to show for it <br>The point is the Capital is unharmed. It makes no sense, to them, that an invincible army would AVOID conflict. So the conclusion is that the JSDF has some unknown weakness and that is why they want a peace treaty so badly.</br></br>  <br>Just to elaborate, in the ancient world you sign peace treaties if you are exhausted and don't see any chance of defeating your foe. You don't start talking peace unless you worry about not being able to win. The Romans simply suffered from cultural clash and misunderstood what the JSDF was doing.</br>  I've been wondering, how do they power lights in the capital? A generator out the back would create too much noise and constantly shipping in charged batteries would take a lot of effort.  <br>If it's not generators, powerline directly from the base ?</br>  <br>Is my absurd attraction to Kuri soley based on the fact that she sort of resembles Lili from DanMachi even though Kuri's already a better character?</br>  <br>Solar panels are a thing together with car batteries.</br>  <br><br>Just imagine how GATE would've played out if the Gate opened up in Showa-era Japan (Pre-WWII). There'd be a fuck-ton of raping, pillaging, torturing, executing, etc. Shit'd be brutal.</br></br>  <br>Well at least it would mean Japan wouldn't be involved in WWII, and they'd have a chance to rape and pillage some other world instead, for a while.</br>  <br> Just imagine how GATE would've played out if the Gate opened up in Showa-era Japan (Pre-WWII). There'd be a fuck-ton of raping, pillaging, torturing, executing, etc. Shit'd be brutal. <br>Err... That's normal for the Empire, so nothing they don't already do.</br></br>  <br> Imperial Japan conquers a whole fucking world and enjoys untold amounts of resources and is ultimately able to conquer most of Asia, as the US would never be attacked due to them being able to find an untapped oil reserve in the not-Rome. </br>  <br>I mean the Japanese would rape and murder everyone they come across. The Empire would be shitting itself scared instead.</br>  <br> and is ultimately able to conquer most of Asia <br>Why would they even do that? Why take China when the Empire is weaker and bigger?</br></br>  <br>Or America in the 60s seeing how barbaric our soldiers were in Vietnam. <br>Or Korea in that era seeing how brutal they were in Nam as well.</br></br>  <br> I mean the Japanese would rape and murder everyone they come across. The Empire would be shitting itself scared instead. <br>Err... THE EMPIRE DOES THAT TOO.<br>That is NORMAL to them. You must be confused, the Empire has no problem with torture, rape or murder by soldiers.

They're not legit today, they're a ridiculous extravagance at the expense of taxpayer money that the JSDF didn't even need to fend off some 200k+ troops anyway. But lets just build the motherfucker anyway to show dem stupid Americans that forts shouldn't be made out of trailers and crates - even though the JSDF could be ordered to abandon the base and RTB at any time.</br></br>  How mad are you that Tomato-kun gets the fuck Booze every night while you can only jerk off to her doujins?  <br> brain-damaged <br><br>Hate to defend Chibi Usa but SMC and the manga both go into further detail as to why Chibi Usa behaves the way she does despite being 900 years old. It's understandable at that point.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't be mad<br>she don't have doujins<br>none of them do<br>I'm more mad at that</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish there were doujins</br>  <br> They're not legit today <br>Of course not, but the Gate world is way behind the times. They wouldn't even need the tanks and heavy artillery to fend off another assault now.</br></br>  <br>I still believe, that modern medicine can help Rori to get more womanly forms to tease Itami, with the help of hormone therapy.<br>Meanwhile they would get huge benefits from doing research on her immortal body.<br>Just one hint from Kurokawa.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? She's fine the way she is. Although I won't deny the benefits of research.</br>  <br>Fortifications also serve to project power and impress the local yokels. The message is<br> we built this impressive shit, so don't rise up in revolt </br></br>  <br><br> literally mutating immortal DFC loli </br></br>  If you were Itami, would you have continued posing as Tuka's father knowing that she'd be open to an incestuous relationship?  <br>Why the stupid Americans? They can't see it.</br>  <br>What do you mean? <br><br>She wasn't open to an incestuous relationship ever.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Assuming they don't trip over or get stuck on the hundreds of dragon corpses littered around the hill.</br></br>  <br>The gypsy natives are already stripping the dragons. Corpses won't last long as warnings.</br>  <br>She climbed into Itami's bed naked and wasn't exactly disgusted when she asked if he was having a lover's tiff with her.<br><br>Seems like she wouldn't have a problem having her father inside of her.</br></br></br>  Don't mind me, just posting the page where Rory won through her insurance policy.  <br>Nah. Fairly certain she just wanted to sleep.

Manga or Anime?  <br>Started with anime, watched it all so far. Decided to read manga after reading this thread. Just 3 chapters in and I see big cuts.<br><br>Go for manga.</br></br></br>   can't find the novel in English anywhere <br><br>Is my google-fu just weak or does it not exist?</br></br>  <br>translations are a myth</br>  <br>doesn't exist</br>  <br><br>If you decide to read the manga be sure to download the high quality volume scans.</br></br>  <br>No one is currently translating it.</br>  <br>If I knew where to find them.</br>  <br>All you need to do is google /ak/ scans.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Th-thanks for the info.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the manga is better anyways</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>I found this, if it's any help<br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Gate_LN:Volume_1_Pr<wbr>ologue<br><br>http://ak-scans.wikia.com/wiki/Nove<wbr>l_Translation</wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>it's bullshit<br><br> some won't translate the novels because the words are difficult <br> or the light novels because they're easily offended like imouto no america-jin scanlator <br> reddit held a contest and mushoku tensei won even though their whole WN is already done by /a/ <br> the manga is going to get licensed by an inexperienced company <br> they think patriotic nip manga to be sold in the US will take off <br><br>being a gatefag is suffering</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Itami wants it.<br>Rory wants it.<br>You're the one out.</br></br></br>   elf dad was hotter in manga <br> Pina Colada was hotter in manga <br>literally trash anime adaptation</br></br>  <br>Everyone was hotter in the manga.</br>  <br> desires of flesh <br>This was never mentioned. We don't know how gods fuck.</br></br>  <br>I think he's getting confused how Hardy want's to marry Rori.</br>  <br>She wants to marry Rory</br>  <br>hate to tell you anon, but wanting to marry does not equal wanting to fuck. Plus she's already ascended.</br>  <br><br>For all we know she just wants to "own" Rory, and marriage is the closest/easiest way to have a god as your property.</br></br>  <br>as believable as any other story we got right now.</br>  <br> reddit held a contest and mushoku tensei won <br>Gate was #2 though.<br>Which says something when you consider that every other series that was in the top 10 were at least partially translated to some reasonable degree, or has regular translations ongoing.<br><br>Yeah, the poll results annoy me.<br>So anyone think someone will pick up the novel? or maybe even the Light novel?<br>Yen Press seems to be in the habit of picking up anything that looks pretty, and has a good following?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you're confused as to the point I'm trying to get across.<br><br>Hardy wants to marry Rory, so I'm simply implying that she retained her ability to feel human emotions, I guess until the specifics of why Hardy wants to marry Rory are explained, this could be the best reason</br></br></br>  <br>  http://ak-scans.wikia.com/wiki/Nove<wbr>l_Translation</wbr> <br>muh /b/ grade grammer<br>Might it be intentional ?</br></br></br>  <br>of all the companies you had to mention, YP is your choice?<br>YP don't even translate that fast. it's like 1 volume per year. <br>they put a C&amp;D on web trans even if they don't got one book out yet. they're the devil.<br> mushoku tensei won <br>fucking reddit MT ain't even that good.<br>i enjoyed it and was here when it was translated.<br>didn't last the whole way but read the whole thing.<br>but it don't deserve to get its LN translated someone legit is gonna pick it up anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yen Press seems to be in the habit of picking up anything that looks pretty, and has a good following? <br>And then just like most companies, they just sit on the copyrights and don't do shit with them except mail out C&amp;D letters.</br></br>  <br> YP is your choice? <br>Simply because of how they seem to be picking up the most in the last year or two.<br><br> YP don't even translate that fast. it's like 1 volume per year. <br>3 per year. Which is slow, yeah.<br><br> they put a C&amp;D on web trans even if they don't got one book out yet. they're the devil. <br>Really? For what series?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They haven't been doing that though. Their releases are slow, sure, but they've actually be putting out releases.<br>Unless there's a case I'm not aware of?</br></br>  <br>When volunteers can put out content faster than paid translators, something is wrong.<br> inb4 they have a lot of projects to do <br>Well maybe they should finish those projects first before they fucking buy up more licenses.</br></br></br>  <br>Gizelle says that she likes men more (but Hadry is fine too).<br>So she compares fucking men VS similar intercourse with Hardy. This implies she has lesbian sex with Hardy somehow.</br></br>   you will never cuddle with a christmas cake military waifu with huge breasts, and is built like a brick shithouse.  <br><br>Why does it hurt to live?</br></br>  <br> something is wrong <br>Yeah, I'm guessing they want to pad out release dates. They can clearly output more; SAO translator translates for all SAO material, including the manga and spin-off novel, which means instead of 3 books a year, SAO get 6 books, and 3 or so manga volumes a year.<br><br>One theory I've read is that it's to give more "breathing room" between release, for the fans that don't really have much money (teenagers) to be spending on a bunch of books so often.<br>If that's the case, I think they're padding too much; every other month should be sufficient, really.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where is the christmas cake? All I see is an 18 year old idol.</br>  <br> Really? For what series? <br>Haruhi<br>Spice and Wolf<br>Hataraku (before it even started too)<br>Durarara<br><br>least pirates can do now is offer scattered translations here and there since YP is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You meant "the most", not "the least" right?</br>  <br> On the other hand, it made a peace treaty 100% harder. <br>So? An insurgency and symmetrical warfare would've been a worst bitch to deal with later.<br><br><br>She's in her early 20s at most. Unless you're trying to perpetuate that stupid chapter 35 meme.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh yeah i meant the most</br>  Cutie pie.  <br> I'm guessing they want to pad out release dates. <br>This is alright if the padding between release dates weren't so absurdly long.</br></br>  <br>How would symmetrical warfare be worse for the JSDF?</br>  <br>Typo</br>  <br>asymmetrical</br>  <br>Cutest potato.</br>  <br>It's shit, for the record.</br>  <br>SHE ANSWERS QUESTIONS FROM OLD MEN FOR MONEY</br>  <br>Kuri is 24 hardly a christmas cake</br>  <br>You know that was a gigantic dick move from Rory.<br><br>She basically forced her way into the dragon expedition and then says it comes with a price. What price is that? Well she just takes Itami's soul without bothering to get his approval.</br></br></br>  Damn. Just one chapter into the manga and it's obvious the anime totally butchered the adaptation. So many character defining scenes were cut...  <br>But she's 35</br>  Kuribiyashi a cute. Very cute I tell you.  <br>She looks like a shota.</br>  <br>Did you upload the wrong image? That looks nothing like Kuribiyashi.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't you guys know anything about LED luminaries? They make LED that fit the T8 florescent tube nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking electric stoves and coffee makers</br>  <br>  2015 <br>  you don't know about fuel cell electricity generators working on methanol or LPG without any moving parts <br>how you even got to 4chan</br></br></br>  <br>100% Kuribayashi. Cute.</br>  <br>I thought she was supposed to have a small frame.</br>  <br>You don't need to be an engineer to shitpost.</br>  <br> dick move <br> making sure that her and itami will be together forever, even after she transcends to godhood and he outlives his mortal life <br><br>Definitely a dick move putting an insurance policy in place on the one you love</br></br></br></br>  <br>But this is common knowledge. You better get out your basement and check if your mom has already installed one in the kitchen to save on the bills and sell surplus electricity because you got ain't no job.</br>  <br>Kurokawa a cute in the anime<br><br>A CUTE</br></br></br>  <br>That 35 you are talking about is the number of a chapter not her age</br>  <br>Actually, Rori is best girl, because absorbing damage while Itami dicked around the dragon kinda hurted a lot</br>  <br>She please herself with comfort women</br>  <br>Yes anon<br><br>I said Rory was best girl a few posts above<br><br>She tanks for Itami<br><br>Makes sure that Itami will be hers after death<br><br>Wants to spend her last 4 decades before godhood with him<br><br>Who can beat her</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention, that Itami can now drink any amount of liquor with her without giving a shit about hangover and health, while listening cool stories of her exploits in Emroy's service.</br>  <br> heavy as fuck <br> flammable <br>Not that anon but the solar panel thing was more plausible. Lighter and safer imo.</br></br></br>  <br>Funny enough, this is actually canonically false. <br>Tuka was in an actively lesbian sexual relationship with her cousin (who was eaten by that dragon)<br><br>I suppose incest is may not be as taboo for elven culture due to their extremely low birthrate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>when itami gives her the dick she'll relinquish pussy forever don't worry boys</br>  <br><br>And people said she wasn't a slut.</br></br>  <br>So they used elven transformation magic to grow dicks?<br><br>What a slut. Only used twice my ass.</br></br></br>  <br>Who wore the pants in that relationship? Her or the cousin?</br>   write a harem <br> Lelei is the only virgin <br><br>that's not how you write a harem story goddamit</br></br></br>  Where are they going to stop story-wise?  <br>Probably after they kill the fire dragon.</br>  <br>Her past relationships aren't really touched upon in detail, so who knows. <br>I would assume Tuka though.<br> <br>She did grow up around a super playboy father, and when she found her father fucking around she wasn't surprised. <br>Dude currently has like 5 wives, 8 lovers, and countless other non-steady pussies</br></br> </br></br></br>  Mortars are love. Mortars are life. <br><br>Just putting this out there.</br></br>  <br>Now I have fuel to burn when people say it's some generic harem</br>  <br>This isn't a harem story you retard.</br>  <br> Chuka <br>more like<br> CYKA </br></br></br>  <br><br>Princess Pina is likely virgin too, although her "I can only handle 50 men at once" statement is fishy.</br></br>  <br>I KNEW IT<br><br>ELVES WERE RUSSIANS ALL ALONG<br><br>BLONDE, WHITE, AND SLUTTY</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you kidding? At this rate they'll have tons of new material.</br>  <br>I'm sure she can handle 100<br><br>And I'm supposed to believe that these women haven't broken their hymens in training yet?</br></br></br>  <br>How is it not a fucking harem? He has like 4-5 women lusting after him.</br>  <br><br>Which is fucking hilarious, because that's all on the Empire's head. They're dead wrong about why Japan wants a peace treaty with them, and do the thing that ensures either A( they are as humiliated as possible, and/or B( there's no Empire by the end of this whole thing.</br></br>  <br>But Chuka never tasted a dick, she is a virgin!</br>  <br>3 at most.</br>  <br>Harem usually has the "negative" connotation of SoL ecchi hijinks with a beta MC.<br><br>But if what you mean by harem is that the MC has a number of girls chasing after him then yes it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Five. Officially five. <br><br>The five girls even get their own gaiden books. </br></br></br>  <br>remember pina's pubic hair will never be animated</br>  <br>Wasn't Rory going to town with the agents manga only?</br>  <br>You mean Delilah's.</br>  <br>RODS<br>OF<br>STEEL</br></br></br>  <br>But russian faggots abandoned it in favor of metro</br>  <br>Probably because there's hasn't been a recent Stalker game.</br>  <br> shitting on metro <br>Get out.</br></br>  You know Rory loves sucking dick.  <br>Nice try gook, but China's claims are twice as absurd and the rationale for them is analogous to a britbong pulling out a map of 13th century Europe in order to prove to France that they have a right to own Calais and Bordeaux</br>  <br>first metro was great but second was meh</br>  <br>No he means Pina's.</br>  <br>I want to take a bath with Lelei.</br>  Where's muh OHOWOWOWOWOWOWOWO <br>OP Single? Where's muh cozy ED Single?</br>  <br>You think the second OP will be as good as the first.</br>  <br>Also here's Delilah's bush while I'm at it.</br>  <br>what a try hard.</br>  <br>Yanagida's injury was totally worth it.</br>  <br>bunch of impotent japs. <br><br>Shitty manga harem mcs too. <br><br>Fuck it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> would touch fluffy tail </br>  <br>That motherfucker got the best deal ever, he got a small cut and in return got one of the hottest women in the whole manga, hell I'd be willing to give an arm or a lefg if it meant I got someone like Delilah.</br>  Why does she seem like a rapist or stealth marriage types?  <br>let's face it Delilah would kill us all from sheer exhaustion</br>  <br>It would totally be worth it though.</br>  <br>Not to mention, that Delilah has sworn in loyalty to death and is actually useful besides hot sex.</br>  <br>Then she would breed multiple cute bunny daughterus.<br>Damn, I'm jellly</br></br>  <br> Then she would breed multiple cute bunny daughterus. <br>Amusing that instead of making the bunnies sing-gender, the author decided to just make male bunnies rare. And this justifies the complete lack of family structure, making it normal for the bunnies to breed with other races and yet with no expectations of having a family.</br></br>  <br>male bunnies are rare cause most of them die of exhaustion obviously</br>  <br>She's just a dirty whore enabler.</br>  <br>Because she isn't a pure girl like someone thinks here.<br>In the whole 3rd recon or between the girls Itami knows she is the most malicious and probably the most lewd one</br></br>  <br>how is every monster girl is best girl</br>  <br>She's pretty skilled if you think about it I mean <br> she's a skilled fighter since she was a warrior bunny <br> probably can do most housework since she was one of clan Formal's battle maids <br> was able to become the head waitress in just half a year <br> can do assassinations/espionage if needed </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it can't be helped</br>  <br><br>Yes, but they aren't going up against a modern enemy at all. The design of the fort is perfect for enveloping fire to ensure every single angle is more deadly than it would have been before while also providing one hell of a demonstration of "Where is your god now" knee jerk reaction from any local who saw it.<br><br>War isn't about fighting the enemy as much as destroying the enemies resolve to fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>enlightened.. or rather a pervert<br><br>God bless him</br></br></br>  <br>He was a nice man.</br>  <br>Tyuwaru is too cute for be a whore.</br>  <br>It really can't.</br>  <br>Tyuwaru and Sherry are probably cutiest girls in the manga so far.</br>  <br>Aurea and Mohmu are pretty cute too, especially Aurea</br>  <br><br>I wish he would've survived, I really wanted to see interactions between him, Itami and Kurata.<br><br><br><br>Aurea is definitely up there with Sherry in my book.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really, REALLY want to fuck anime Rory.</br>  <br>Science must do something about that.</br>  <br>I wish, unfortunately neither SJW's nor religious nuts would ever allow such research to take off.</br>  not using radio-isotope fuel cells<br><br>fits on a flatbed truck.. bury it, can power a city for 25 years</br></br>  <br>Sad.</br>  <br>Great way to jinx whole gateworld:<br>let in nips with fissile materials.</br></br>  <br><br> <br>Next time we see her, she's going to be in worse state than Noriko. Gangraped and beaten to near death</br> <br><br>My dick is going to be rock hard while my face is going to be red with rage, I won't know what to do</br></br></br></br>  <br>radioactives might fuel Hardy's powers or something</br>  <br>What? I thought the JSDF ended up taking all the prostitutes back with them to the Alnus community.</br>  <br> with her boyfriend corpse next to her, died trying to protect her. Nips saved her just in time. <br>The JSDF gives her an home and a job out of the streets though</br></br>  <br>no, people have to moves on their own to Arnus town.<br>The JSDF can only pick up refugees</br></br>  <br>Nah only member even entertained the thought and then figured they'd just end up whoring themselves BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE IDYLLIC ALNUS LIVING COMMUNITY ONLY CATERS TO MONSTER RACES AS WHORES. She had a serious derp moment there.</br>  <br>No, she stayed behind with her boyfriend. <br>When Zorzal started his bloody uprising many demihumans in the capital fled, including Tuwar and her boyfriend. <br>Prince's men caught up with them at a village<br> murdered her boyfriend while they raped and beat her. JSDF found her barely alive next to her boyfriend's corpse </br></br></br></br>  <br> BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE IDYLLIC ALNUS LIVING COMMUNITY ONLY CATERS TO MONSTER RACES AS WHORES. She had a serious derp moment there. <br>You missed the point. The girl said outright that she doesn't have the skills to learn a trade so she choose prostitution. Moving her to another town isn't going to make her change her career.</br></br>  Zorzal also tells his own sister (Pina) to be his fuckwhore at one point, much to Pina and Diabo's horror. <br><br>The guy's dick is out of control.</br></br>  Does anyone else get their time to shine besides Itami and Kuribayashi?  I wonder how Lelei and Rori would react on Stargate movie and series <br>and Tuka on The Lord of The Rings.</br>  <br><br>That's pretty fucked up, now I hate that faggot Zorzal even more.</br></br>  <br>She could had worked as a nurse for Kuro clinic</br>  <br>Or as a waitress, or help in removing dragonscales.</br>  <br>I hope they cut his dick and balls off and made him swallow them before they killed him.</br>  <br> Zorzal also tells his own sister (Pina) to be his fuckwhore at one point, much to Pina and Diabo's horror. <br>sounds like a lovely chap</br></br>  <br> Bunny sex slave kills him. <br> Zorzal had the time to moral injurying her but nothing of value was lost, she was a an evil cunt like him and actively tried to fuck up relationships between Japan and the Empire. </br></br>  <br>Kengun and Sugawara. <br><br>Kengun disobays direct orders by the government to retreat, and goes in to save the Rose Knights. Vifeeta develops a huge crush.</br></br></br>  <br>Why don't I remember this. I even read up to the latest chapter yesterday.</br>  <br>It's from the LN which is way ahead of the manga.</br>  <br>Oh.<br><br> tfw you will never princess carry a cute tomboy female knight <br><br>Might as well kill myself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Sugawara<br> <br>Sugawara the diplomat, goes fuck all to diplomacy you can't have my wife to the inquisitors who came for Sherry's head. <br>This is the catalyst to begin the final full conflict between Zorzal Empire and JSDF.</br></br> <br><br>Failed as a diplomat, but succeeded in growing a pair and spine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Or as a waitress, or help in removing dragonscales. <br>And once she did that, why would she not want to get extra money on the side by walking the streets at night? It is fine to give her better prospects, but if she wants to sell her body it is still her right. The difficulty with Japan of course is that prostitution is still technically illegal there.</br></br>  <br>Technically by that time, the dragon corpses have already been cleaned up and there hasn't been any attacks on the base, so no more dragon scales, it's full blown PX trade center now.</br>  <br>The thing is she doesn't want to work as a prostitute she and the others do it because they have no other way of feeding themselves as they have no special skills that can help them get a job, they even outright state that in order to do their work they have to be high or they wouldn't be able to take it.</br>  <br>All because cute sage knew that you need invest to save capital.</br>  The Cobra will be retired in your lifetime. ;_;  <br>Do you remember the UN charter on Refugees? Oh how a nations suppose to help those in need?<br><br>And how in the modern day nations are openly defying the agreements they themselves signed, now that the economy is shit?<br><br>It is all well and good to think one is morally superior, but if you want to talk big you better be prepared to go all the way. There are poor people everywhere, even in Japan. You can't just randomly decide a girl should get a job because you want her life to be better but somehow not help the thousands of others just like her. Clan Formal got the right idea, they gave the beast people sanctuary but only in a way that makes sure they help as many as they could and not overstretch. The nurse was clearly against the idea of prostitution, but it is not her job to spend government money to spread her own opinions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is the catalyst to begin the final full conflict between Zorzal Empire and JSDF. <br><br>I wonder how Zorzal felt when he was stabbed by the bunny?</br></br></br>  <br>He was probably hurting.</br>  Question for novelfags, is Pina actively trying to get Itami's dick?  <br>What happens after this point? Emperor still continue the war or does Pina step up afterwards (I don't remember where she lies in the line of succession)</br>  <br>Why would Mediterranean beauties even want some filthy japs? It's just wish fulfillment for the readers. Mostly all the single jap males get chicks beyond the gate while the jap females naturally don't. Classic conquest of native peoples, take their women.</br>  <br> Question for novelfags, is Pina actively trying to get Itami's dick? <br>Eventually. But only when it was far to late and Itami had already gained legendary status. Pina's advisers actually agree that she would benefit from having Itami as her husband in securing her claim to the throne. But since there is no reason for Itami to agree to this she is stuck unable to do anything. As the new ruler she is not allowed to beg, and yet she needs him more badly than he eeds her.</br></br>  <br>Pina develope a crush for Itami, Hamilton told her she should marry him in a political marriage for increase her power on the imperial nobilty but she really likes him and doesn't really need that political marriage.

Dunno, the Aquarion series still exists.  aldnoah wasn't bad compared to some other mechas, but it was the biggest waste of a budget ever<br><br>aldnoah's budget was similar to fate/stay night and wtf did they spend it on? that garbage cgi?</br></br>  That's the one that had character designs by Shimura Takako, right? Sucks that it sucks, I was planning on watching it eventually.  <br> aldnoah.zero <br>You got it.  It was worse than GSD. </br></br>  That's not M.D. Geist 'Colon' Deathforce  Who's the cuck on the bottom right?  GSD&gt;VVV&gt;A/Z  Captain Earth is worse.  <br>CE has Bones traditional animation at least. It's not overwhelmingly beautiful like Star Driver and E7 but it's still pretty nonetheless. Shitnoah Zero has ugly as shit CGI mechs.</br>  <br>Aldnoah was mecha?</br>  <br>Better than G Reco.</br>  Dai Shogun is worse<br>Also, Ginguiser</br>  <br>I don't get everyone who says Aldnoah's animation was shit. Have you innocent virgins never seen actually bad animation before?</br>  A Wakening of Trailblazer is the worst  <br> CE has Bones traditional animation at least. <br>That just makes it worse. The fact they wasted all that beautiful animation and great OST on boring trash that goes nowhere and does nothing. Writing that assassinates any possibly tension, character drama that is preemptively resolved before it can get interesting. Pitiful attempts at fanservice neutered by Bones' prudish standards. <br><br>CE is a waste of everyone's time, including Bones'.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least it looked decent, that shitty mecha this season is far worse.</br>  <br>You actually thought that drab CG looked good?</br>  Aldnoah was FUN  <br>What, you mean the generic as fuck one starring les SAO man?</br>  <br>Cuck of the year.</br>  <br> all those mechashows in the season <br> so much hype was build up <br> most of them werent as good as expected <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br>No idea, that with the 50 min first episode, not that I watched even half of it.

I don't watch mecha a lot but most of the modern mecha shows that I've seen are garbage, Frontier is the only one I really loved (and is not even completely mecha, it's more half mecha half idol anime).  <br>Nah, same shit as Kill la Kill, it just somehow got extremely hyped.

Stupid shit can still be fun. <br><br>CE is just boring though. Nobody had fun with it. Animators worked their fingers down to bloody nubs doing the action and transformation sequences and it just turned out so fucking dull. You could conceivably skip every action sequence in CE and not miss anything important. That's how bad it was.</br></br></br>  <br> Frontier is the only one I really loved <br>Opinion disregarded</br></br>  <br>Code Geass</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628937 <br>Thing is, you can't say it's overrated just because you don't like the first few episodes, when it gets really great later on</br>  <br>People actually thought Kill La Kill was good though. However KlK was also really fun to watch. <br><br>Everyone knew Cross Ange was shit but watched it anyways because it was hilariously bad. <br><br>The only way they're similar is they were both fun rides with shitty writing.

I could watch KlK while Cross Ange was so bad I just couldn't watch it, I even tried picking it up again at episode 16 or so but had to drop it after some minutes. Utter shit.

Worst mecha series in recent memory is probably M3 The Dark Metal.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd say best mecha period including everything is Gundam Unicorn. Best mecha on TV is probably Knights of Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>Goddannar</br>  <br>Vulvarape is probably the worst</br>  <br><br>Definitely the most massively overhyped one for what it ended up delivering. Remember this is the series that Aniplex constructed and assembled another super team of popular creators (only one of which had any remote experience or insight into mecha anime and left the project 3 episodes in) ala Madoka Magica to try to start a franchise that would in it's presidents own words supersede Gundam. It's like they thought literally all they needed was a magic quartet of Urobuchi, Sawano, Aoki and Kajiura with their darling Sora Amamiya as the female lead and everything else would magically just fall into place.<br><br>Granted it worked for a while and then Butcher fanboys found out he wasn't writing the scripts anymore and TIMBEEEEEEEEEER!!!! Realistically that's all it took, like the show was actually charting really well before he confirmed his level of involvement on twitter and various conventions. If Aniplex had just kept that in check and tried to act like he was still writing the scripts maybe things would have turned out differently at least financially for the series. As it is now it will probably sell worse than even G-Reco which it's creator actively tried to sabotage commercially which is hilarious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was fun, especially with /a/ though</br>  <br>The amount of hype and self-glorification was beyond ridiculous for what the show ended up being.</br>  <br> I'd say best mecha period including everything is Gundam Unicorn </br>  <br>Shin Mazinger Z a best</br>  Aldnoah.Zero have some serious problems, especially on it's second half.<br><br>It's still not as bad as Gundam Seed Destiny though. Actually everything that is bad on AZ, Gundam Seed Destiny is able to do worst.</br></br>  <br> episode 16 <br>There's your problem. DRAGON world was the most boring part of the show.</br></br>  <br> If Aniplex had just kept that in check and tried to act like he was still writing the scripts maybe things would have turned out differently at least financially for the series <br>No sane person would approve of this kind of shit writing we had in A.Z.

Make some fucking videos already.</br></br>  <br>If Aldnoah is the best mecha in the last 10 years then mecha has been a pretty shit genre for a while<br>I don't even watch mecha and I know you're wrong</br></br>  <br>Logos has actually been decent so far. No Akino or inserts, but it's been getting better each episode and the cast has been more likable than EVOL's. You get used to the character designs fast.</br>  <br>Yea thats kind of why that other comment kinda triggered me. I also actually like the cast and the themes.</br>  I gotta say I was avoiding mecha for a long ass time and I've just started watching Gundam 0080 war in the pocket and it's been pretty damn good. Apparently Zeta Gundam is even better?  It's not so bad compared to the really horrible crap like Gundam AGE, G-Reco or Dai Shogun. <br><br>It's in the same tier of mediocrity with the likes of Valvrave, Majestic Prince and Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>That's not MLA: TE.</br>  <br> Gundam AGE <br><br>Isn't that the Gundam that was so horrific that Bandai pretends that it doesn't exist?</br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was watchable unlike aldnoah zero.</br>  <br><br>This unit is PANICKED and used HUNKER DOWN.</br></br>  <br>Aldnoah zero was complete shit. Valvrave has it's flaw but it was a lot more fun to watch than Inaho shit.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128637823 <br>It's pretty bad tbh and only Tomino-fags defend it to death anyway.</br>  <br><br> wanting more reviews from a guy who think KnK is one of KyoAni's best works </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128637823 <br><br>Both are shit. I wonder when this "G-reco is an misunderstood masterpiece" meme will stop...</br></br>  Aldnoah S2 could've been much, much better but I suspect they would've needed more episode and more time to properly write them.<br><br>It's pretty funny that the series was hammering home how UNDERSTANDING wasn't going to stop the war, but Peace Princess and Prince I Fucked Ur Waifu show up and magic the entire war away using the magic of DIPLOMACY and UNDERSTANDING.</br></br>  <br>Funnily enough, I dont even remember the ending of A/Z S2 but quite clearly remember how the first season ended.</br>  <br><br> That description <br><br>So it is like Top Gear,  ambitious but rubbish </br></br></br></br>  <br>Calling AZ ambitious is a bit much, it's pretty much just a combination of mecha tropes that never goes anywhere.</br>  <br>It definitely was ambitious<br>The staff were saying stuff like "it will surpass Gundam" before it aired ,and hyped it to death<br>Of course , it ended up being shit</br></br></br>  <br>AKB0048,Inb4 idolshit.</br>   yfw Majestic Prince   <br>This is the biggest waste of potential I have ever seen.<br>Its literally the most ambitious show ever made but fuck it we suck.</br></br>  <br>Fafner</br>  <br><br>That's Hino fault because he cannot into writing TV shows due to him using video game writing logic, and let's not forget this gem:<br><br> Made ambitious goal that the PSP games tie-in would sell 1 million copies <br> Sold less than 10% of its target (both games sold around 70k combined) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Worst. When fucking Gundam V exists.</br></br>  I don't know, g-reco was pretty fucking bad  <br>The staff had ambitions but the work itself did very little to back that up.</br>  A/Z and Build Babies Try are easily the worst  <br> hating on V gundam </br>  <br>Hino sucks at writing video games. Who's bright idea was it to give him control over something he has no experience with?</br>  Yeah Aldnoah Zero or Captain Earth for sure, Two if the biggest jokes.<br><br>Mecha genre is fucking dying anyway, It's too predictable and boring that no one wants to do it any more apart from Gundamn stuff.</br></br>  <br>ufotable did Kara no Kyoukai though.</br>  <br>KnK as in Kyoukai no Kanata.<br>Kudos for thinking of Kara no Kyoukai though.</br></br>  <br><br> wanting more worthless opinions from an Urobuchifag </br></br>  <br>That's actually the joke. If you were to say something like "I'm so fucking mad that Bones screwed over ZnT", I would have said "But J.C Staff/Mappa did Zero no Tsukaima/Zankyou no Terror!”. It’s not really that funny, but the point still stands.</br>  <br><br>From WONFES.</br></br>  <br>Star Driver</br>  <br>I absolutely love 0048 but have a very difficult time calling it a mecha show. It has mecha in it, sure, but it's a pretty minor aspect of the show.</br>  <br> Urobuchifag <br>If that were the case wouldn't he have mindlessly given Aldnoah a 10/10 just because Butcher worked on the first couple episodes?</br></br>  <br>Did you watch the video? Half of it was spent apologizing for Urobuchi's involvement. He claimed the reason it sucked was because Urobuchi wrote a few episodes, outlined the plot, and then fucked off.</br>  <br>The first couple of episodes were pretty okay. Bellybutton magic was fantastic. After that, it all kind of petered out in a pathetic manner though. Not even those glorious handdrawn mecha fights could keep me there.</br>  <br>Linebarrels was good.</br>  <br>I liked A/Z.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128637823 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128638504 <br>G-Reco was complete and utter shit.<br><br>Turn A was the last truly excellent gundam, unless you count build fighters (I don't, mainly because they're dumb, exciting fun and nothing more).</br></br></br></br>  <br>God, Doga Kobo just gets shit done. I really can't wait for them to do another mecha anime.</br>  I didn't have a problem with Aldnoah Zero and I loved the ending because it was (kind of) out of nowhere. And then they made season 2, and THAT is one of the worst mechas I've ever seen. The only one that comes to mind next to it is Gargantia and I haven't even finished it yet.<br><br><br>Evangelion 2.22</br></br></br>  <br>I think Hino is great for concepts, but after he makes the initial idea, lock him out of the writing room. <br><br>AGE infuriates me with how great it could have been. A generational Gundam could have been incredible. I thought the mechanical designs were pretty good too. AGE-3 is fucking sexy as all hell. But it all goes to shit in the most embarrassing way possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Orange did the CG in MJP, didn't they?</br>  <br> Evangelion 2.22 <br>It doesn't really hold up that good compared to the original TV series, though.</br></br>  <br>I think you meant "best mecha ever made". Either that or you've gone full retard.<br><br>I mean, <br><br>Aquarion<br>Valvrave<br>Nobunaga the Fool<br>Daimidaler<br><br>and those four are just the trainwrecks I've personally witnessed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is M3 good? I'm on episode 4 and so far I'm staying for the hilarious Okada quotes  <br>It doesn't hold up to fucking Bayformers, I don't know what Lelouch is on about.</br>  <br> Lelouch <br>That's Jebus, even he's less obnoxious than Lecunt.</br></br>  g reco's initial episodes were pretty terrible and then Sage died so I just dropped it.<br><br>Tomino shouldn't have embarrassed himself with that show. The only thing I really recall was he put a toilet in the giant robot, and also there was a brazilian space pope or something who controlled the space elevator, and the space pirates were actually the good guys trying to throw off the corrupt Federation government.</br></br>  <br>Oh, it appears they did.</br>  <br> best mecha ever made <br>You watched season 2, right?</br></br>  <br>I had far more fun with all four of them than A/Z.</br>  <br>Yes bd soon.</br>  <br><br> Eureka seveN <br> Edgy </br></br></br>  <br>Each of those four were much better than aldnoah zero.</br>  <br>Fucking this. It's the complete opposite of edgy if nothing else.</br>  <br>I said it tried to be edgy, which is definitely true. Halfway through the show was 100% NOT about surfing, but instead muh despair.<br><br>Ending saved it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>At least Aldnoah had parts that had me interested. First episodes weren't terrible and the sort of 90's greenscreen mech design and Kubrick references were a nice touch.<br><br>VVV was just overall shit. It was "fun", but I don't see why Aldnoah wouldn't be "fun" in the exactly same way.<br><br>Neither are good but VVV is definitely worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Okay, now you're overdoing the hate. There is no way Space Vampires piloting robot mechas to fight over a space conspiracy was better than A/Z. The OP of Valvrave was awesome, but that was just about the only thing.</br></br></br>  <br> Vandread <br>I cant believe someone else knows it existed I loved that series<br><br>Athrun never cucked kira and put the blame for the destiny plan and the messiah on Shinn though</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't see why Aldnoah wouldn't be "fun" in the exactly same way. <br>Aldnoah was ugly. Really ugly. The CG was ugly and it didn't blend in well with the ugly backgrounds at all. On top of all this, there was almost no discernable "fun factor" usually present in mecha anime. It didn't have Patlabor's charm. It didn't have Ishikawa/Nagai's "fuck you I'm edgy and I'm proud!" It didn't even get Code Geass' bizarre polical conspiracy right.<br><br>Aldnoah.Zero has nothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>First two episodes of aldnoah shit was good becuase of the martians winning with their technology. After that the series just turn to complete shit with Inaho coming to the rescue every single time and making everyone around him look dumb. It was the same repetitive shit over and over again. <br>VVV wasn't that repetitive and the series had way more interesting character unlike aldnoah zero especially with the earth cast. Also characters actually died in valvrave while nobody died in aldnoah zero. Vlavrave had it's problems but it was a much better series than aldnoah zero.</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed the hell out of Valvrave. Aldnoah got dull around the time the Martian of the Week episodes began, and I never really got back into it. I repeatedly fell behind and had to force myself to catch up more than once.<br><br>So yes, I'd genuinely put Valvrave over A/Z. Both were poorly written, but at least Valvrave was fun to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Name one element of aldnoah zero besides the ost that was better than Valvrave. Characters?Plot? Development? Anything.</br>  <br>Come on the final ark isn't edgy the whole show was based on using old mecha homages<br>Arc 1 young boy goes on adventure<br>Arc 2 he realizes that people are dying/this is war<br>Arc 3 despair and suffering<br>Arc 4 overcome problems and unlock the mecha's final super modo so he can save the world<br><br>Eureka seven was just following standard procedure. I bet that 90% of mecha shows in this thread follow this procedure</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aldnoah was ugly <br>You're right, but I don't think being ugly has nothing to do with being unfunny.<br><br>And no one was comparing it with Patlabor or anything "decent". It was being compared with VVV, which is on the same level of shitness.<br><br><br>I can't really see why anyone would claim this. Everything you stated about VVV was bad and at least as bad as Aldnoah. I also don't believe "characters dying" is any measurable factor of greatness.<br><br>Both Aldnoah and VVV were trainwrecks that were "fun". Aldnoah really dropped the ball with Inaho reaching Mahouka-Jesus levels and other shit, but at least it made an effort. There were parts that I didn't find completely terrible. First episodes were really not that bad and the ending of first season was so out there I really enjoyed it. VVV was just shit episode after episode. It didn't even try. Only scene I even found remotely "fun" was when the teacher become Moses and split the ocean of students. And that's a lot said, as I pretty much remember only a one unrelevant scene from entire series.<br><br>I'm not saying Aldnoah was good or that I'm a fanboy, but c'mon. At least it had decent ost and mech design was often spot on with the technology gap. Before it went full cyber-eye there were things I didn't find outright horrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Come on the final ark isn't edgy  <br>That's what I said, numbnuts<br><br>Also<br> conceptually deleting space itself, graphically destroying whatever was partially inside it <br> not edgy <br> giving hubby-chan a kissu so he can asplode <br> not edgy <br> beating children <br> not edgy <br> And don't give me that "Holland was just Brightslapping Renton!" garbage either </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>uhm, I think you're embellishing in your memory, but Valvrave had just about the most boring, clichéd cast ever. To wit, we had<br> hot-headed idiot MC (aka Suzaku without PTSD) <br> the Shirley <br> black-haired aloof bitch who tries desperately to be Kallen <br> idiot delinquent who totally steals the MCs hot-headed shtick <br> hikkikomori bitch <br> utterly forgettable douche-canoe <br> ERUERUFU (aka white-haired Lelouch, complete with his own over-idolized Nunnally) <br>aaand a bunch of utterly forgettable bad guys, except for that psycho kid voiced by Yuuki Kaji whom I still want to run through a meat grinder despite being voices by one of my favorite VAs and that "call me Moses" guy who I still periodically remember and chuckle at</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The model kit for the sleipnir is better than he valvraves<br><br>M3 was pretty good i'd give it an 8/10<br>It was a while since I had seen a yandere in mecha. Lastime I saw one was in Nadesico</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Pretty good <br>The show was really dumb and tried to achieve shock value by twists after twists. I now "edgy" is a buzzword but it's been a while since I watched anything with that dark palette about angsty teenagers. Antagonist had shittiest motive in a long time. 3D was ugly.<br><br>The sad thing is that in the first episodes it seemed like it really could go somewhere. But it never did. It was meaningless twist after meaningless twist with characters you really didn't care and couldn't connect with.<br><br>Only redeeming feature was that the first op was sort of catchy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Overall mech and environment design?</br>  <br> Rather, what's the BEST mecha from the last ten years? I don't watch mecha a lot but most of the modern mecha shows that I've seen are garbage, Frontier is the only one I really loved (and is not even completely mecha, it's more half mecha half idol anime). <br><br><br>Gundam 00 hands down</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because after all of that the cast for valvrave was still better than aldnoah zero.</br>  <br>The "deletion of space" its just a unique weapon the enimies have I mean they are aliens after all. I thought it was a nice change from lasers everywhere. The only other time I've seen it in use was in Fafner.<br><br>And c'mon hollands beatdowns on Renton were definitely throwbacks to brightslapping bones did break off from sunrise afterall. Another reason was the fact that he was jealous he won Eureka<br><br>Now as for the child abuse I won't lie it was somewhat edgy but used in moderation to darken the tone of the show frome time to time</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay anon you hate VVV and you think aldnoah was better but as I said before vvv had much better characters and the plots for both shows were about the same. Also people find vvv way more fun because it wasn't the same repetitive shit with the gary stu main character coming to the rescue in almost every episode. That shit started from episode three to the finale. Also there was absolute zero character developments among characters except for slain. Go back to valvrave and you will see that each of those characters had their moments and developments.</br>  So it's come down to this huh? It's not enough to argue about how my fav anime is better than your fav. We've now got to argue for why one shit series is a bigger piece of shit than the other one.<br><br><br>Let me tell you why that's bullshit. After the first few episodes, I came to V3 expecting some ridiculous shit out of it; the sort of campy stuff you might get in a B movie. I wasn't expecting high plot, just ridiculous characters like Elf doing ridiculous shit in the vein of 80s/90s action stars. I got what I went into for.<br><br>Now AZ on the other hand? War drama? Nope. Regular romance/drama? Nope. Cool mecha fights? Almost, but eventually nope. The central conflict about Earth vs Mars? Nope. Music aside, I got nothing out of AZ. AZ was just a series of build ups that mounted to nothing. Just promises, no punch line.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam SEED</br>  <br>You misspelled gunbuster anon</br>  <br>But you were still able to remember defining character traits for the valvrave cast. Could you do the same for a/z if asked?</br>  <br>KEK, sure Gundam Seed is not the best Gundam but call it as worst when we have show like A/Z is completely wrong</br>  <br>hm... lesse<br> borderline autism MC who's got great aim and enough knowledge of physics that he should already have a degree <br> the shirley <br> the Euphemia who (somehow) doesn't die <br> the second MC who has to endure just about everything awful until he's crazier than a sack full of weasels <br> Snazzbaum, the sleazy smug bad guy who still had a likable motive <br> the most boring Heroes' best friend <br> a bunch of bad guys most of whom are killed off before they could become interesting <br> a surprisingly interesting Euphemia/Nunally crossover <br><br>Frankly, I watched this show because of Inaho, Slaine, Snazzbaum, Lemrina and Asseylum (and the awesome awesome music). I didn't like all the story decisions, but I actually found the fights to be well animated and with great music, pretty much just like Guilty Crown, except with a slightly more agreeable ending and less shitty story decisions along the way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam Seed Destiny is still better than A/Z tell me what Destiny did that is worse than A/Z</br>  <br>I'll give you the part about being repetitive, gary-stu rescue was overused. Other points not so much.<br><br>Plot for VVV was really shit. Aldnoah sort of stayed the same and was true to being shit, VVV tried to pile more and more shit to the pile until you really couldn't tell what sort of space-vampire-alien-conspiracy shit it was trying to be. And it really was one of those things that on paper sounds really fun, but it was never portrayed as ironic work and you couldn't even get chuckles out of vampire-rape as it was never played as comedy. Only thing that made the series "good" were the treads on /a/ and that really has nothing to do with the series itself.<br><br>As for the characters I feel the general problem was, which you pointed out, that they were never quite developed. There were some characters that could have been something if given spotlight, like ptsd-drunk or the martian girl, but never got anywhere. But hell, potential existed, whereas VVV cast was just very uninteresting. Only person that I ever felt could go somewhere was the eyepatch-antagonist as he was portrayed sort of mystically in the beginning, but the character development and spotlight that "every character got" turned out him being just some alien or something.<br><br><br>But I don't see that as a problem. Both works are bad, but at least you expected something from Aldnoah, which would mean that at some point, some time, you believed the series would have something. To me even that alone is a bigger merit than series being intentionally shit, and I don't know if VVV actually ever tried to be shit, as it never was quite the comedy /a/ made it to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Frankly, for a lot of the main cast I had to look at the TVTropes page. For A/Z, see<br> (though I still had to look up Lemrina's name)</br></br>  <br><br>Certain bits of the show (like when Renton went berserk at the mook and found out it is actually piloted when he sees the pilots remains) and the manga is pretty "edgy"</br></br>  <br> it will probably sell worse than even G-Reco <br>The last time i check the last volume of A/Z sells worse than even Cross Ange</br></br>  <br>I like it when Bones anime gets edgy. DtB and FMA did that really well, especially the latter; but I don't think E7 handled the edge nearly as well as either of those series. I think it would have been just as good if the violence weren't as overtly-graphic as it turned out being.</br>  <br>Now that I recall it did have that edgy factor to it. I never really noticed at the time but I still thought the ost was god and the animation was decent. While the cg was jarring at times I didn't find it too distracting. He story while it wasn't a masterpiece it was at least somehing mild and the two "twists" can be seen from a mile away if you've seen a couple of meha series</br>  <br>Valvrave still had the better cast anon. Inaho was a shitty gary stu with no character background. Nothing from his character. I can't beleive that you even liked asseylum. I honestly can't take you serious again after hearing that. <br>The only thing I'm getting from pro aldnoah anons are better music and mech designs which isn't saying much.</br></br>  <br> at least you expected something <br>No, I went into it by being cautious, expecting nothing in particular. I didn't expect much, maybe cool mecha fights at least.<br><br>It was in hindsight, i.e., after actually finishing it, that I can look at it and say that they wanted to achieve many things and did none. At all.<br><br> a bigger merit <br>No it isn't. It's the reverse. That is the absolute worst thing to do. It just made the whole thing a complete waste of time (barring the threads on /a/.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could've forgave Aldnoah Zero if had stopped at the end of the first season and the war continued in a whole new direction in the second with a new MC and cast.<br><br>Or at least Inaho and Princess got together for fucking sakes.</br></br></br>  <br> the two "twists" can be seen from a mile away if you've seen a couple of meha series <br>That's one element which made it sort of bad, it was very cliche but still tried to pull the twists with shock-value alone.<br><br>Not that anon but I can't defend any character from VVV either. There was some aliens and eruerufu did some plans no one understood. Problem in Aldnoah was that many characters were never really developed but even by existing they made the series far better than VVWild ride.<br><br>Aldnoah get's the "at least you tried" medal, while VVV is the strange guy who rolls around in puddle because he realizes he will never amount to anything. Trying is more positive than being just shit.<br><br>In the image you can see the moment where the main cast sort of realizes their own show is shit and stop trying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's say it this way:<br>After they tried to scare the viewers with Asseylum's death the fifth time, I started getting attached to her like "come on, you've bullshited us with this so many times, you're not actually gonna do it, right? Right?" and I sort of liked how ignorant of the world she was. After the series is over, the best I can say about her is how she took a huge stinking shit on convention and ended the whole clusterfuck in a political marriage, thereby ending a conflict surprisingly neatly and putting a giant gravestone on a thousand shipping debates.<br><br>My favorite character was still Snazzbaum and I'm still pissed at Slaine for murdering him, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> at some point, some time, you believed the series would have something. To me even that alone is a bigger merit <br>What kind of shitty logic is that? Having 'believe' in it is irrelevant to the show's actual quality. You're on fucking /a/, where people jump to conclusions about shows that haven't aired and we're neighbours with /m/, which is already shitting on the new Gundam show based on trailers and staff announced.</br></br>  <br>i was really mad that Chaika got a shitty budget in comparison. The characters and the fights there still ended up being enjoyable, but I know they could have done so much better.</br>  <br>If nothing else, it means the series had a beginning that left you wanting more.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/5038527  <br> Aldnoah get's the "at least you tried" medal <br>Are you American? Because that medal is worth nothing.<br><br> he realizes he will never amount to anything.  <br>Yeah, nope. V3 had better mecha battles than AZ. Not mounting to anything describes AZ more than V3.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Princess <br> Wanting that Sora 2.0 piece of shit to be happy </br></br>  <br>/m/ has be pretty chill about g-tekketsu they loved the designs so far and like how it gives of an "after war gundam X" vibe. I'm pretty excited myself the director is at least competent enough to give us a 7/10 series at least</br>  <br>tengen toppa gurren lagann</br>  <br> had a beginning that left you wanting more <br>So Valvrape then. A body jacking space vampire sounds way more promising than the plot of what sounds like another cheap attempt at imitating Gundam.</br></br>  <br> Had better mecha battles <br>I don't remember any of them. They were in space at some point I guess. It was just unmemorable shit with ugly mech design. And what was the thing with harakiri-super attack? You couldn't come up with anything more ridiculous?<br><br>Really? I guess it's your opinion and all, but body-jacking vampires pretty much sums up what was wrong with the series. It's just stupid and tries to rake in the retardation-points.</br></br></br></br>  <br> by existing they made the series far better than VVWild ride <br>Just to make you think like that because the potential it promised but it never happened which is why it is bad writing</br></br>  <br> Lol it's now edgy to shit on what a lot consider the best ever <br>the post<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128644518 <br> I'm a newfag who still thinks mocking eva makes me look cool <br> I'm a newfag who hasn't realized that people only hate Shinji ironically now <br>the post<br><br><br> First episode ends with New Orleans nuked from orbit <br>Say against that show what you want, but THAT actually looked like it had potential<br><br>Though, to be fair, Valvrave's beginning also looked promising, until the writers forgot about the Vampire thing for six episodes and then thought, "shit, our characters have done fuck all vampity lately, so let's throw in some LEL EDGY RAPE SCENE"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128644625 <br>Gundam</br>  <br>But if you have a character you want to see developed and shone light into means you are interested in the said character. Which is automatically more than I can say about any of VVV characters.</br>  <br>Yeah I see what you mean there but I feel the reason most people bring that up is due to the shows artstyle. Eureka seven's genki yoshida designs do set you in that happy mood so when the darker parts of the show occur it can be unsettling (like the scene with renton going crazy with after killing those pilots)<br><br><br>Yeah I've been meaning to get to the manga. From what I heard it's the victory gundam of the eureka seven franchise</br></br></br></br>  <br>Came out 35 years ago</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128645315 <br>Yes?</br>  <br> But if you have a character you want to see developed and shone light into means you are interested in the said characters <br>It is everyshow ever</br></br>  <br> It's still not as bad as Gundam Seed Destiny though <br>Nah, GSD actually makes sense, everyone is that show is a fucking idiot. Nothing in A/Z makes sense hell not even the title makes sense since it was suppose to be about Slaine apparently reaching "zero"</br></br>  <br>Except Valvrave</br>  <br>So what does that make you think that better than VVV characters</br>  <br> I didn't have a problem with Aldnoah Zero and I loved the ending because it was (kind of) out of nowhere <br>Jesus fuck this shit taste</br></br>  I give VVV the credit it's due, at least it accomplished what it set out to do with revealing the truth of the world. A/Z had no point and felt like a huge waste of time.  <br>The franchise still continue and watching all of them are good</br>  At least VVV had god-tier cast and OPs unlike Aldnoahshit.    <br>You have to admit the decision to kill (even though the second season ruined that) seemed kinda ballsy. It really made the finale go from "meh" to interesting.</br>  <br>Not everything has to be musashi Gundoh to be shit. It was extremely uninspired fights for the robot CGI and the animation for characters was passable but nothing to write home about. Further, the direction of the animation is part of the animation and when you have scenes like anti-anti-tank missile loli jeep you can probably call it shit,</br>  <br>Valvrave is the easy answer, it is literally the physical incarnation of all hopelessness focused entirely on twists and shock value that becomes outdated after the firs viewing. It is a textbook example of everything that could go wrong without the concept being a factor and everything wrong with the mecha genre ever since Code Geass was successful in omni-pandering and Haruhi Suzumiya and K-ON sentenced the industry into the current fad of slice of life shows being the "in" hip thing.</br>  <br>Not really because it was fucking obvious that it was meant to grab idiots to watch the second season, anyone who was smart enough knew what they were doing.</br>  <br>actually I had a giant nerd-gasm when I saw Inaho stepping out of the car at the start of S2.</br>  <br><br><br>This is what happens when idiots watch G-Reco</br></br></br>  <br>VVV ended with witch mobs that killed thouusands and liberated no one.<br>Aldnoah was at least entertaining.</br></br>  <br>You are everything that's wrong with anime fandom</br>  <br>because the eye</br>  <br><br> This is why "Stick to A/Z faggot" became a thing in /m/ due to some of the people there got sick and tired of others begging to be spoonfed </br></br>  <br>but it wasn't the Code Geass I was craving for</br>  <br>The ending where the main girl gets taken over by the supercomputer and starts behaving like a slut goddess is pretty good. Sure the fight animation for the ending was pretty good, but it was a dull fight. All I cared about was how how hana was evil.<br><br>Delicious evil brown.</br></br></br>  <br>Worst piece of shit I have ever completed.<br>I felt like I wasted my time in nothing when I finished, all the characters were shit. <br>Marito did nothing.<br>The other 2 girls that I can't remeber what their names are were useless.<br>Slaine was a fucking retard.<br>Inaho was a damn robot.<br><br>I can't believe people liked this garbage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>VVV also didn't introduce a new character 2 episodes before its finale to tie up its loose ends. <br><br>The very existence of Crutons Jr. is easily the worse writing in any mecha this decade.</br></br></br>  How come everybody hates CGI?  <br>Well it worked. We got less people complaining about G-Reco</br>  <br>People who aren't idiots don't. It's badly done CGI that's hated on.<br><br>Akito OVA's CGI wasn't being hated on since it was actually done well.</br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave is definitely worse.</br>  <br>Everybody hates CHEAP CGI. Looks fine when it has effort put into it.</br>  <br> now that I recall <br>Early on the mahvess seemed to be powered by the pain and suffering of angsty teens. I thought the edginess was pretty on-the-nose.<br><br>I think that the underlying concept of communication was pretty good. It certainly wasn't executed very well, and there were some plot points I wish they could have gone even edgier in (MC with his brothers fiancee sexual tension?)<br>maybe 6/10 (slightly better than average) but could have been better if it was just presented in a more exciting and less trite manner.</br></br></br></br></br>  Valvrave is legitimately the single worst mecha anime ever and that is in no way a meme and an exaggeration.  <br>Because it generally looks bad? Especially among mecha fans because, as on of anime's oldest genres, it had it's golden age in a time when CGI didn't exist..<br><br>Full CGI like sidonia S1 looks okay, MJP is probably the best example in recent mecha to pull it off well. AZ's bad CGI is just another tick mark on its long list of faults.</br></br></br>  <br> MJP is probably the best example in recent mecha to pull it off well <br>Fafner EXODUS's CGI has also been fantastic so far.</br></br>    AZ threads were filled with fujoshits from tumblr. Therefore it's the worst.  <br>I liked the progression of the second season a lot more. Sure, it was shit, but with all of the new orbital knights and the ocassional slaine HAPPENING moment, it was a lot more entertaining than most of the first season. If they had actually pulled something closer to code geass, I'm sure most of us would feel it was more entertaining, but certain things really brought it eg princess drama.<br><br><br>Haruto acting violent was foreshadowed for a few episodes in advance. No one was surprised that he might attack someone during airing. What was surprising was the accompanying rape.</br></br></br></br>   A/Z <br> Valvrave <br> G-Reco <br>Mecha is pretty much dead, Fafner is just desperate life support</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's vvv that is the worst. In comparison to A/Z it has worse cast, worse characters, worse plot, worse writing, worse action, worse cgi, worse music, and overall unenjoyable unlike A/Z which was moderately enjoyable.</br>  <br>Valvrave is the worst. <br>Aldnoah.Zero does undoubtedly want you to take it seriously. You can really tell it's trying to be an epic space adventure, filled with interesting politics and awesome characters, but... it just isn't. It's not like, say Valvrave, that pretty much just insulted your intelligence and credibility as an anime fan by just watching it; Aldnoah.Zero legitimately wants you to be pulled into this world, to care about these characters, and to really be on the edge of your seat as events play out.</br></br>  <br>GOING GOING HIKARI E</br>  <br> Haruto acting violent was foreshadowed for a few episodes in advance. No one was surprised that he might attack someone during airing. What was surprising was the accompanying rape. <br>At episode 2, tgat is not foreshadowing. Then nothing with the vampires is done, so yes they did forget it, then suddenly rape.</br></br>  <br> one tries to be serious but fails <br> ultimately insults your intelligence by putting up pretenses of intelligence (rayleigh scattering etc.) <br> one tries to be goofy with silly plot twists <br> on-the-nose writing, but you know what you're getting into <br><br>I don't know how you can argue on those grounds. Valvrave failed in a lot of ways, but it managed to entertain in the ways it wanted to. Yes it is stupid, but its hard to argue that a show that was trying to be intelligent and ended up being just as dumb is somehow superior. Maybe less disingenuous, but that's like arguing a statement made ironically is equally uninformed as the same statement made in earnest.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  At least the first cour of VVV was fun to watch. A/Z was just awful. It's like the writers improvise all the time. At the end of A/Z's first cour they make think there's something between Inaho and the princess, but then they only have scene together in the second cour and he possessed by his bionic eye. I don't know why they even bothered.  <br>Valvrave is the worst when all is said and done. Valvrave is a complete failure, a failure to provide good characters, memorable scenes, or even to entertain. Why does Valvrave fail at being dumb fun? And why should you not watch Valvrave as opposed to an anime very much like it, or an anime whose sole purpose is to provide easy brain candy. After looking at the lack-luster characters, the stupid plot-twists and all that other wonderful bullshit. For all its eccentricities, Valvrave is a show that's missing a lot of soul. When you watch a show that tries to achieve that same feeling that Valvrave attempts, I at least feel, it's a show born because the creators wanted the audience to have a little fun. Valvrave feels like it's engineered for the sole purpose of keeping the audience around long enough so they feel obligated to buy merchandise, and all the craziness that it contains: those stupid plot-twists and ludicrous situations, are born from that. And yes, you could argue that's the purpose of every anime that's ever existed, but still, you're not supposed to be so obvious about it. Valvrave is an empty fireworks show; an hollow mess that's devoid of passion, creativity and soul, that feels like its very blue-prints was built to pander to the biggest demographic possible. Valvrave is the worst mecha-anime. Not self-aware. Not "so-bad-it's-good". Not clever in any way. It's the inevitable result of putting together as many typical tropes of the mecha genre as possible, mashing them together, and hoping that it will be eaten up by the masses. So yes, just... plain... bad.</br>  <br>Bodyswap hijinx? I'm pretty sure that occurred before the rape. And though it's been a while, I recall haruto lashing out in the episode previous.</br>  <br>No you are rememberingwrong Aldnoah was fun and vvv was just shit.</br>  <br>in stillframes, sidonia-type cgi looks okay<br><br>during any movement whatsoever, it's fucking shit-tier eye cancer of the worst goddamned kind<br><br>who the actual fuck thought it was okay to render that shit at 12 fucking frames per goddamned fucking second?<br><br>jesus christ</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the other way around. <br>VAMPIRES IN SPACE &gt; Autistic kiddo defeating every enemy without breaking a sweat</br></br>  <br> Bodyswap hijinx? <br>Never actually happened. People wanted to see them but there were none.</br></br>  <br>is this pasta? I agree valvrave was meh and stopped watching it after like 4 episodes, but holy shit that wall.</br>  <br>Except both of them wanted to be serious and be taken seriously. It's just that Aldnoah actually tried while vvv did not.</br>  <br>g-reco was fucking awful<br><br>schizophrenic pacing, endless numbers of one-dimensional characters (often introduced and then discarded one or two episodes apart), a confusing (admittedly less so after additional research after the show finished airing) story that couldn't decide what it wanted to do, and varying animation quality does not a good or even acceptable anime make<br><br>much less one falling under the gundam banner<br><br>it was a fucking catastrophe, and you know it<br><br>the ONLY acceptable parts of it were the good fight sequences</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you really arguing that A/Z was any better? Obvious female gaze pandering, lazy writing, lazy setpieces, the bare minimum effort to make the MC look OH-SO-COOL compared to other characters, and just as many idiotic plot twists as valvrave also designed to simply rope in the audience each week.<br><br>When you consider that valvrave was SUNRISE and like gundam EXISTS TO SELL MERCH (no one has any illusions about gundam so why have 'em about valvrave) it's hard to feel betrayed. A/Z may have started with a soul, but the writers just started doing things near the end because whatever. It's just as messy and nonsensical.</br></br></br>  <br>So autistic retard losing with a giant robot and needed a white haired Russian gary stu, who can't pilot, save him is more entertaining than a standard robot fight with interesting tactics?</br>  Aldnoah failed because they did everything they can to not be Gundam. It needed to be Gundam Seed for it to even click locally. They avoid that and then it flopped. Had Aldnoah done a more grounded approach to SEED's storyline, it would've actually taken off as a franchise  <br><br>It is actually, and it is basically spammed by the same autist in /m/ (with different variants) because VVV raped him or something</br></br>  <br>No, I sat through the drek that is Valvrave and at no point found anything worthwhile or of value in it.</br>  Oh, I see G-Reco's finally getting mentioned as well. Time to bring in Cross Ange so we can get the full party going.<br><br> lesbians, lesbian rape, mind rape and tons of women and children getting killed is fine <br> nipples is still no no even in BDs. <br>CA is indeed the worst.</br></br></br></br>  <br> A/Z <br> Valvrave <br> G-Reco <br>One of the these things is not like the other<br><br>One of these things just doesn't belong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure why you bother responding, when all you'll get is some "you didn't like if because you're an idiot who didn't understand it" strawman.</br>  <br>Infinite Stratos 2 counts as a mecha show, right?</br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br>Best example of them trying to not be SEED is personified with Asseylum. They tried hard to not draw the obvious comparison to Lacus Clyne or heck, even Releena Darlian, as a result, her characterization suffered immensely</br>   VVV  <br>So bad it was fun to watch<br> Aldnoah <br>The same but you knew there was good intent but it was completely mishandled<br> Reco G <br>Just completely bland so it became uninteresting I couldn't tell if it was good or bad<br> CA <br>Just stupid fun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> VVV  <br> So bad it was fun to watch <br>Sorry meant to say so bad that it's bad and not fun at all.</br></br></br>  1. Code Geass<br>2. Full metal panic<br>3. Dunno haven't watched any other mecha anime</br></br>  <br>what is entertaining of standard robot fight with tactics from gary tsu MC? are you 12 years old?</br>  <br>No it's an accurate analysis of why vvv is so awful.</br>    <br>More entertaining than a robot overheating and freezing up every five minutes.</br>  <br> of course asspull is more interesting </br>  <br>Asspulls is literally all vvv is.</br>  <br>First season is pretty good if that helps</br>  <br>Gundress. Hands down.</br>  <br>Probably the faggot reviewer who is getting his opinion from /a/ and sharing it on youtueb</br>  <br> implying all of A/Z is not asspull more </br>  Whats wrong with AGE? I know its not great but I cant quite put my finger on where it sucks  <br>It isn't. If you think tgat then you obviously didn't watch it.</br>  <br>best post in the thread<br>not to mention that some of the best mecha designs is in 00, audio/ music is god tier too(duh), Kawaii is just GOAT)</br></br>  <br>this Exodus had godly cgi. you can always count on xebec to do good cgi I would even go as far as to say I prefer it to he originals animation</br>  <br>The MC itself is an asspull, how can you still defend that?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628302 <br> Evangelion <br> Mecha <br>Pick one, shitlord.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off /m/oron</br>  <br>if those are your complaints you haven't watched enough mecha. In the mecha genre rape and child abuse of all kind go hand in hand</br>  <br>So is Sue-Elf from vvv and that shit also comes with the most inconpetent useless Shinji ripoff that is even worse. How can you defend that?</br>  <br>NGE isn't about the mecha. It's about the characters, m8.</br>  <br>Not my fault you suck at reading comprehension.</br>  <br> implying a/z wasn't an asspull <br> inaho didn't get shot in the head it was his eye and now we have technology to give him a new eye that will cause him to surpass kira yamato but it's only for inaho and NO other soldier would get this upgrade even though a squad of them would win the war. BUT WAIT if he uses it too long he'll die. <br> lol jk we took it out of him </br></br></br>  <br>people didn't like the final arc because it became seed/destiny again where the mc was too afraid to pull the trigger and just became a mecha butcher</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128644625 <br>Gunbuster<br>Diebuster<br>Evangelion<br>TTGL<br>Mostly Gainax stuff. There's probably something else I'm forgetting that isn't Gainax.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The inconpetent was helped by the competent one who was trained child soldiers for 8 years, that's make sense</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128628390 <br>wb NGE</br>  <br>And they were still more boring and infuriating than Inaho who was at least entertaining.</br>  <br>It liberated the world from the Magius and accomplished the goal of exposing the truth. Honestly A/Z bored me, the fights were too predictable. If the mecha action isn't fun then I'm out.</br>  <br>The sad part is it didn't have to be that way, they could have easily introduced him earlier and not made him feel like an afterthought. It really feels like he was thought up last minute because they didn't have the guts to follow through on anything. Really the show should have just been 12 episodes, the "plot" didn't warrant 24.</br>  Well, since we seem to be /m/ today: What did y'all think of Linebarrels of Iron and/or Overman King Gainer? Based on the overviews, they look to be at least fun.  <br>You're trolling right?</br>  <br>Well there's also Mari Okada's Aquarion Evol, M3 and the new Gundam she's going to ruin with her shit writing as well.</br>  <br>It didn't liberate people. It took away freedom and turned into a red scare situation with witch mobs and people selling each other out.</br>  <br>I know right, what a great ending.</br>  <br>You didn't like EVOL's deep symbolism?</br>  <br> MC literally IM SO COOL bait with asspull <br> It is more entertaining <br>You just prove you are 12 years old</br></br></br>   defending aldnoah unironically itt <br>ay</br>  <br>I don't speak the language of the cur. It all sounds like barks to me.</br>  <br>L-Elf was overpowered but he wasn't a one noted Mary Sue. Cain beat his ass in first season and he failed to protect the one he wanted to protect, also he lost his best friend and had an actual emotional range unlike Inaho who was a boring flat character without a personality who was a plot device without carrying the show.<br><br>Unlike Inaho, L-Elf wasn't well liked or accepted by the Module until he proved himself. Inaho never fucking struggled for anything.</br></br></br>  <br> Inaho who was at least entertaining <br><br>Inaho's so irrelevant in his own show that Aniplex shuns him in Wonfes.</br></br></br>  <br> boring flat character without a personality who was a plot device without carrying the show <br>You literally just described L-Elf. <br><br>And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that cannon probably raised the price by 2000 yen</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128649840 <br>The first season was the same boring shit as the second one. There is no difference between them quality wise. They are both the worst.</br>  <br>In the end she really didn't have much characterization to speak of, she was very much a parrot spouting things others had said. They really had no idea of what to do with her, so they put her in a coma for a good chunk of the show.</br>  <br>Slaine's getting another figure too, I find it ridiculous how Inaho has been ignored. They're not even hiding their favoritism now.</br>  <br> another <br>That's the same one that was announced before, the only difference is that it's colored. Inaho is getting one of that maker too.</br></br>  <br> And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season. <br><br>No, he didn't. He was a monotonous plot device now with forced homolust in second season.<br><br>L-Elf carried VVV easily. He struggled, committed mistakes and got an actual character arc.<br><br>Inaho's entire arc was dropped so he could become Slaine's therapist. He was such a shitty character nobody cared about him besides what he would do for Slaine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And Inaho struggled with his personal issues in the second season. <br><br>His eye? That amounted to nothing and was handwaved? They made it sound like it was too late and that it would kill him, turns out he could remove it and suffered no repercussions.</br></br></br>  <br>This is bad. Why couldn't Aniplex add an Inaho little stick too? It seems mean spirited.</br>  <br> L-Elf carried VVV easily. He struggled, committed mistakes and got an actual character arc. </br>  <br>How is that wrong you retard, did you even watch the show?</br>  <br>I think so too. Adding something that tiny and ridiculous to one but not the other makes it look like they only want to troll whoever buys the other one. Not that I care since I won't buy either but it's kind of a dick move since they'll probably cost the same. Actually I bet Sleipnir will be even more expensive.</br>  <br>Hey newfag, that guy is a regular troll in every mecha thread. He greenquotes you with an epic maymay picture to start shit and then watches quietly as you all fall for his bait and reply to each other thinking it's him. Ignore his posts and lurk the fuck more.</br>  <br>They seem to love to ignore him, I think they viewed Sleipnir as the face of the show more than they ever did Inaho. He never even got a solo spread, it's pathetic.</br>  <br>Really, who wouldn't want a teeny tiny Inaho to go along with Sleipnir? Unless they fucked up and Sleipnir isn't to scale with Tharsis.</br>  <br>Yes I did and he is easily the secobd worst character in the show. His plan always work, he takes on giant robots without one of his own and wins, has no trouble durung the show at all, as lways gets what he wants.</br>  <br>It is. You can see it in here  that's the correct scale, Tharsis is 17m and Sleipnir is 13,5m. I'm thinking they might add it later since Tharsis didn't come with that tiny Slaine initially, but if they don't, then that's a dick move. I wouldn't be surprised after what happened with the magazine spreads, though. They were never discreet about their bias.</br>  <br>How they've treated Inaho just feels weird, I know Aniplex only cares about money but usually it's not this obvious.</br>  <br>I'll never understand why they keep pushing Inaho as a main character in interviews and focus so much on UFE and Inaho and then pretend he doesn't exist outside of that. Maybe they're just that bad reading their audience. For example when Inaho got shot in S1 they were legit surprised at how many fans were worried about him and how little cared about Hime dying again. It looks like they underestimated their own character and thought no one would care about Inaho because Slaine was in the show. Incidentally they overestimated Hime and don't know how to deal with the hate she got so they ignore or avoid any questions about her that are politically incorrect. This is amazing in it's own way, they're clinically delusional.</br>  <br><br>Aniplex is no stranger to hyping shit up but that series took the cake.</br></br>  <br><br> Hurr hurr hurr I'm a retard on /a/. I'm going to "implying" that you said something stupid but I'm not going to take it any further than that because I'm a retard on /a/. <br><br>Seriously why do people do this shit, like you literally aren't even saying anything, you've done absolutely nothing to counter his point whatsoever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a retard from /m/ actually.</br>  <br><br>It really does feel like he practically Alan Smitheed himself off of the project. I haven't seen him mention it once on twitter and he actually seemed to get agitated when people brought it up to him at a con as if it was supposed to be on the screened questions list but it managed to get by and he was forced to talk about it. He even still mentions and talks about Gargantia on occassion and he wrote even less scripts for that one.</br></br>  <br><br>It's in the latest SRW game so obviously not. Honestly the show was alright up until the last quarter or so where the 3rd generation MC and antagonists motivations and actions stopped really making any sort of logical sense even within the context of the course of events.</br></br>  <br><br>It seemed like they basically just copied ideas from the latest Gundam series that were coming out at the time like AGE and Unicorn. They really seemed to specifically want it to be their own version of Unicorn with the disc and merchandise sales to go with it. They even got the same composer to try to do the music even if he captured none of what made his work on Unicorn so strong.<br><br>The thing with Unicorn is though that it's capitalizing on over 3 decades worth of continuity, themes and canon within a franchise while Aldnoah was supposed to be a starter series, yet they seemed to have the expectation that if they got that specific assortment of people that it'd all work out.</br></br></br></br>  I'm not reading through all this shit thread but, OP, you honestly haven't seen true garbage bin mecha if you think Aldnoah Zero is that bad. <br><br>az was, if nothing else, a huge pit of wasted potential because the basic premise is promising (although the actual worldbuilding itself turned out to be flimsy at best). In that sense, it might be the most disappointing mecha anime I've seen in a long while (although between GBF Try and G. Reco being from a similar timeframe, it's a pretty damn well contested spot). <br><br>I thought americans might be familiar with something on the level of Candidate for Goddess's shittitude, since it aired on adult swim back during its initial run. Or maybe M3, because it's contemporary? You know, actual absolute trash.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly UC Gundam is pretty great in general as are most Gundam series as long as you are not a complete cynical contrarian asshole. I'd personally avoid Seed Destiny and AGE though, the former for not really capturing what it is that makes most Gundam series great and enjoyable and the latter for really just not being able to capitalize on it's ideas and really just kind of insulting the intelligence of the viewer in it's last act especially.</br></br>  <br><br>He managed to make penance to Bandai at least by making Yokai Watch.</br></br>  <br>If eva is mecha then so is SnK</br>  <br>Fan-art by the way.<br>Eva's have a mouth.</br></br>  <br><br>That's what a lot of his fanboys claimed so that they could keep it in their heads that he's utterly infallible, but the reality is that even Urobuchi admits that he wrote a template for them that they sort of kind of followed albeit with tweaks of their own. The guys credited as original creator for crying out loud, I don't know how much higher up the echelon of a franchises order of prestige and authority you get than that. Yeah he didn't create, write scripts and lyrics for, direct and storyboard it like Tomino did Mobile Suit Gundam, but still that original creator credit isn't just there for show.</br></br>  <br>Better?</br>  <br><br>That's cause they tried to make the show all "grit and serious" like in the producers own words Man of Steel.</br></br>  <br><br>Symphogear and Kamen Rider are /m/.<br><br>Your argument is collapsing here just as bad as it does on /m/.<br><br>You don't have to wonder why he's shitposting about &gt;/m/ on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>L-Elf had a personality, though. It's just that both he and Eggs were Gary Stus.</br>  <br>not that guy but those count as power armor</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128652808 <br> what is an AT field </br>  <br> L-Elf had a personality <br>Epic meme!</br></br>  <br> I'm not reading through all this shit thread but, OP, you honestly haven't seen true garbage bin mecha if you think Aldnoah Zero is that bad. <br>That is true. Valvrave is the worst.</br></br>  <br>SnK is /m/, we just don't talk about it because we don't like it. Just like Doctor Who.</br>  <br>Slainefags love making up meta fanfics.</br>    <br>Cross Ange, VVV, and maybe Guilty Crown (if we even want to count it as mech) were all worse.</br>  <br>They did a very good job marketing it, if only they put that much effort into the actual show.</br>  <br> has no trouble durung the show at all <br>Cain beats him and half of the Module is gassed.<br>He fails to save Lieselotte. He broke down and most of the Module was killed.<br>He finally manages to beat Cain but Haruto dies just after he became friends with him.<br><br>You don't have to even like VVV but L-Elf was okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tharsis didn't come with a tiny Slaine, but they did a Count Slaine fig to showcase last Wonfes too (Aniplex made). It wasn't on scale as this. I don't think it's trolling but mostly that they know Slaine gives them money.</br>  <br>What focus? All Inaho amounted as "save muh Slaine" in the end.</br>  aldnoah zero is as much mecha as code geass, having mechas does not make a show mecha  <br>L-Elf wasn't a Gary Stu. He was overpowered, but to be one he had to be flawless and well loved and praised and L-Elf was neither of this. He was also held back by not piloting or having super powers.<br><br>He was competent because he was a child soldier raised by an ancient fascist alien.</br></br></br>  <br>Having mecha does in fact make a show mecha, and aldnoah zero had less mecha than code geass.<br><br>In case you haven't noticed, Code Geass follows the gundam formula and is very mecha.</br></br></br>  <br>valvrave, that shit was straight up the worst show I've ever seen. not even gonna post pic cause I don't want to save it to my computer.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128655620 <br> not liking melodramatic Mazinger Z </br>  <br>Because eggs</br>  <br>Both Aquarions are good, but Nobu and Daimidaler are both worse than Aldnoah.<br><br>Valvrave is WAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY worse than Aldnoah.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Am I the only one who noticed this?</br></br>  <br>good? what good about that, the retarded MC? the retarded mecha pilots? retarded earth forces logistics? or the fucking white base that they find for i don't know, plot convenience</br>  <br>The more I look at that picture the more angrier I get</br>  <br>My ebony skinned long lost brother!</br>   everyone has forgotten buddy complex <br>Next someone will claim it was actually good when the only entertainment came from how hilariously stupid the characters were.</br>  <br> a forgettable series is being forgotten <br>No way.</br></br>  <br>VVV is better than Aldnoah. Are you high? Aldnoah was hyped and overhyped as a good show and was shitty. VVV was always trainwrecky and never took itself seriously.</br>  <br><br>Good job trip-kun.</br></br>  <br>FUCK. I want the Tharsis. It looks so good painted.</br>  Guys, stop replying <br>He's an autist from various forums trying to shit up /a/ and /m/<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Nothing is better than Valvrave.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>NOTHING.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can't decide which is worse, A/Z or G-Reco apologists. Both of these shows are utterly shit but each side pretends that their champion is somehow better than what it was.  <br> who the actual fuck thought it was okay to render that shit at 12 fucking frames per goddamned fucking second? <br><br>Japanese</br></br></br>  What did everyone think of Break Blade? I saw the tv broadcast episodes and I was super fucking entertained by it. Is the manga better?  <br>Fafner and Exodus</br>  <br> Valvrave was the worst. <br><br>Valvrave had these two, making it much better then Aldnoah.</br></br></br>  <br>Plus, Exia. MOTHERFUCKING EXIA! the name alone is golden, not to mention it's amazing design.</br>  Are you seriously implying the A.Z cast was better than the one in VVV? Even Shoko is better than Asshime.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128652808 <br>spics sure do</br>  <br>Break Blade was fun, it had some great mechs in it.</br>  Aldnoah.Zero was a 2 season long Sawano music video  which means it is 100% worth watching.   <br> Sawano music video <br>If I wanted that, I'd just watch Unicorn. AZ is easily one of his weaker works.</br></br>  <br> he's the best MC gundam has ever seen <br>But Uso Ewin. Setsuna is pretty great regardless.</br></br>  /m/ says hi  <br>But it was probably the second best 2014 mecha show after Argevollen.</br>  Is there a shitposter that can match VLVRGR?<br>I can only think of degeneracy-kun.</br>  <br>Fucking hilarious</br>  <br> degeneracy-kun <br>Which one is that? The anti-loli guy? The anti-crack yuri pairing one? I've kinda lost track who and what are around.</br></br>  <br>I was referring to the anti-crack guy. "Degrading the characters" was his catchphrase.</br>  <br><br>Replying to high quality bait</br></br>  There were four good things about A.Z:<br>1. Sawano OST<br>2. Kalafina songs<br>3. El Dorito<br>4. Rat-chan</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, then definitely him. He's crazier than vlvrgr on the basis that as far as I'm aware, the latter doesn't buy doujin of things he hate just to tear them apart later.</br>  <br>pretty decent show. enjoyed it very much</br>  <br>Shingeki noKyojin</br>  ZZ Gundam  <br>You see, if a show doesn't try to be some deep war drama masterpiece, it doesn't matter if it isn't. <br>If, however, it does try to be just that, it's just pure shit because it tries to be something it isn't.<br><br>Stop being a dumb child. <br>No show is better because "AT LEAST IT TRIED".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even VVV is better than Aldnoah.</br>  <br>No valvrave took itself seriously too. It just never tried to do anything unlike Aldnoah which at least tried to be good.</br>  <br> Terrible character with mediocre voice actors <br>No, Aldnoah.Zero is still better.</br></br>  <br>A/Z cast is far superior.</br>  <br>GBF S1, it was pure fun and one of the best mecha OST</br>  <br> valvrave took itself seriously too <br>what<br> at least tried to be good <br>Most anime don't get made with the hope of being bad. That excuse means nothing.<br><br>Yeah, you really should stick to AZ.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You haven't seen a lot of mecha, have you?</br>  <br> No show is better because "AT LEAST IT TRIED". <br>Fucking Americans, man. Them and their 'medals for everyone as long as they tried' is really toxic attitude to have.</br></br>  <br>But Valvrave never took itself seriously. Look at episode 5. It was always promoted as mecha trash for fanservice by Aniplex and Sunrise. <br><br><br>Moses has more characterization than anyone from Aldnoah, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No it always took itself seriously and wanted to be taken seriously. And it was promoted as some mysterious serious show.</br>  <br> valvrave took itself seriously too <br>Only because you're retarded. <br><br> It just never tried to do anything <br>Just like AZ then.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, it is Valvrave. <br>With Aldnoah.Zero you can tell that tge staff cared about the project, unlike Valvrave'sstaff who have stated that they didn't care about writing for most of the cast and did care about the story.</br></br>    <br> And it was promoted as some mysterious serious show. <br><br>no, it wasn't? it was promoted as mecha trash and fujobait with haruto "meeting a boy who will change his fate."</br></br></br>  No Im@s thread; then lets make one.<br><br>Did /a/ enjoy the top cake?</br></br>  <br>And we make some small ajustments and we've for CG's vocal powerhouse and a bankrupt Cygames all in 1 turn.</br>  <br>Mecha spinoff is related to the series only in name. Personalities drastically differ and voice actors too. The only thing in common is the base designs and names of the characters. Otherwise, it's your standard sunrise mecha show.<br><br>Aside from a shared setting, there isn't really any connection between the two. (Although CG chronologically takes place after the 2011 series). The approach and story framing of 2011 and CG drastically differ from each other so each is a completely different experience and it doesn't matter which you start on. But for Chronology's sake, go start on 2011 first.<br><br>In my opinion, both series are well animated where it counts (i.e. the performances) but fuck should I know what your standards are for these things, so it's best you watch it for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we've for <br>we've got</br></br>  <br>I love Rin and Uzuki</br>  <br>the fake CMs were easily the best part of the idolmaster anime, i'd love to see them do one with kaede as protag</br>  Who is your  second  favorite seiyuu?

They should exercise like the ancient Greeks.<br><br><br> muh <br><br><br>The action was awful another major weak point of the show; 0/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> terrible <br>  Why are they in track suits, anyway? <br> action was awful <br>0/10</br></br></br></br>  <br> wisely <br> great battles <br>It's just tournament shit without anything at stake, and the artstyle made it worthless, not to mention one minute of action scene would have been enough for 50 minutes of high tier fanservice.<br>Yet the faggots decided they will blow all money into only one thing, because their morality doesn't let anything more, and it was still cheap, filled with QUALITY and had horrible designs to begin with,<br><br><br>Well Prisma Illya was adapted far too tame as well, they always blow their efforts into the kiss scenes, and forget to draw their bodies delicious and lewd.<br>At least it's nowhere near ViVid's complete faggotry level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Obviously. <br>Also, screw the haters I'm looking forward to season 2.</br></br></br>  <br><br> New /a/ doesn't even talk about the current airing show <br><br>That's because the old shows wasn't carried only by loli fanservice. Even StrikerS had a passable story, setting and characters. Vivid has nothing going for with besides the service scenes, I might as well just download some Nanoha hentai, which there are plenty, and be done with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That didn't stop people from discussing it though. There was still a lot of fighting among the fanbase, but the threads used to last for days even though it wasn't airing.</br></br>  <br>I want to hug her.</br>  <br> Vivid has nothing going for with besides the service scenes <br>It doesn't even have service scenes aside from a very ridiculously tame shitty bath scene.</br></br>  <br>This is what happens when the slow panning service scene of the adaptation looks like this.<br>ViVid died.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if Seven Arcs released that fucking movie we'd have something to talk about.</br>  I enjoy the Nanoha franchise a lot, but I do not like parts of the fanbase. The fightan and powerlevelfags are okay but the /u/fags and the lolifags are cancer. Can't even enjoy cute girls doing cute things unless they're being massively pandered to. It's obnoxious.  New /a/ is old /a/ recycled except a bit more serious. Instead of faggots from gaia and chatango we have people from r/anime acting like pretentious douchebags. On the plus side blogshit is kept to a minimum but the whole 3DPD thing has literally become a meme where its posted in shit like Seiyuu threads.<br><br>Honestly I'm different but it's still funny to see people flip when someone posts ;_; though people /r9k/ need to go since they're actually annoying.</br></br>  <br> massively pandered to <br>More like seeing them being appreciated, instead of awkwardly covered up as if they were disgusting shit, and giving them QUALITY designs since "who cares, they are disgusting shit anyways".<br>No, thanks, I'd rather a staff that doesn't think like that, and maybe after that I could enjoy cute girls doing cute things. <br>Not that any of them did any cute thing in ViVid, since there weren't SoL scenes, only fighting and training.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the lolifags are cancer <br>Who the fuck do you think made this franchise big after the first two series?<br>Ungrateful fucking action fags I swear to god.</br></br></br>   Innocent Sound Stage <br>Anime soon  after the GoD anime .<br><br><br> Old /a/ used to talk about Nanoha daily <br>Not really.</br></br></br></br></br>    old nanoha threads were just garbage animesuki transplants anyway. why would you miss talking about a series with retards who think innocent is good?  <br><br>Fuck off. Tournaments are great. Not everything has to be life or death battles. The battles in Vivid were fun, and I'm glad they chose to spend their little budget in them instead of fanservice<br>Action&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fanse<wbr>rvice.</wbr></br></br></br>  I want LRD and annoyed hetfags to go.  <br><br><br> normies <br>Jesus christ.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a fucking retard that can't even read or comprehend the problem some people have it.<br>Action and fanservice are both an important part of ViVid.<br>Action scenes cost 100 times more than fanservice scenes.<br>They still cut out all fanservice, just because of their shitty morality, and despite that the show still looked horrible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want people who don't like loli or care about their fanservice to go.</br>  <br>Get fucked, fanservicefag<br>Fanservice should always be an optional side dish<br>Action is the main dish. I prefer great and fun battles to fanservice. I'm glad they didn't pander to fucks like you. It's not because of morality. It's because they had budget and/or production issues. Every single show by A1 in Spring looked shitty</br></br></br>  OP is a normie  You wouldn't a Yuri.    <br> It's not because of morality. It's because they had budget and/or production issues. <br>No, since it wouldn't take anything not to cut the fanservice. It has nothing to do with budget or production. This is A-1 faggotry.</br></br>  <br>But they didn't cut it. The bath scenes were still there. The problem is that it looked shitty for budget and/or production issues. Every single show by them in Spring looked shitty. That can't be a coincidence</br>  <br>Oh they cut or changed just enough scenes besides the bath scene.<br>The funnies was the bathing with mamas "give Fate a service shot, but don't dare show Vivio's body" bullshit.</br></br>  Amite is my waifu.  <br>I always figured nanoha has been a unpopular series since forever.</br>    Higa Yukari  <br>You'd have point, if they didn't show everyone during the hot springs scene</br>  <br>It's not like they showed much.<br>And bath scenes are bath scenes either ways, even the most innocent shows have them for a reason.<br>Unless they focus strongly on them it's not real fanservice, and they sure did focus more on that shit eating number than any of the lolis.</br></br></br>      <br>If you are who I think you are, you're just a shitposter who wants a loli hentai to air on TV. Even on Prisma, you complain, and that sure as hell focuses on the lolis in it's TV version</br>  Best Onee-chan.        <br>Nice shitpost</br>    <br> who wants a loli hentai <br>I just want lolicon material to at least be brought into animation on an almost regular ecchi level.<br>I don't need it to be extremely lewd, just some nicely drawn bodies. Illya blew all budget on the kiss scene, and they didn't draw their bodies basically.</br></br></br>  dat hair    <br>The bodies in Illya are well drawn, you shitposter. <br>Hell, if we're gonna compare to regular ecchi shows, it actually looks better than DxD S3</br></br>  <br> completely remove subaru and teana's nipples in hotspring scene <br> "waah muh lolis r ruined" -you </br></br>  I want a proper scan.  Reminder that normie is a term made up by normalfags trying to fit in, alot like OP and this thread.  <br> current airing show <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Not true. DxD S3 had plenty of cameltoes and curvy legs/butts. Even this season has show like Shimoneta or Okuusama with well drawn bodies. I don't even need them to go that way, but the blob navels are a bit too much.<br><br>It's almost sad how lewd that small girl is, and how far away the anime is from the manga.</br></br></br>      <br>Now I know you're shitposting. <br>Illya looks really nice, and definitely better than the QUALITY fest that was BorN</br></br>  oh god Stern  <br> Illya looks really nice <br>Maybe, but they are not nearly drawing them as lewd as DxD or the manga is.<br>No tone, shine, shadow, vagina bones, cameltoes on them.</br></br></br>    I want to pet Lynith.  <br>Everyone moved onto Symphogear.</br>  <br> lolifans died with ViVid anime <br> mechafans died with Symphogear <br>Quite funny.</br></br></br>    <br>Nanoha isn't a loli anymore so I've lost interest.</br>  Nanoha is too good for normies to watch tbh<br>They don't have to even know it tbh</br>    <br> lucky star tier characters <br>So, good characters?</br></br>  Don't mind me, just posting bestest Vivid.  <br> Symphogear <br>We have the Corona though.</br></br>    <br> Has /a/ been taken over by normies? <br>Yes. The most reasurring confirmation of that is that you, the OP pretending to be an oldfag, is using normie isntead of normalfag. It's normalfag, not normie.<br><br>Fucking newfags.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>StrikerS was disappointing but otherwise alright.<br><br>The first movie was good, the second movie was missing a lot of content.<br><br>Vivid is kind of boring. Force is just all around shit.<br><br>Nanoha is dead mate. I remember all those Nanoha/Fate threads but the magic is gone. Let go already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>          <br> It's not lewd, so it's bad <br>What a shtty logic</br></br>  <br>They need some evil force/organization and a threat. I remember watching the first to third season of Nanoha and rooting for Nanoha as she faces overwhelming odds.<br><br>The tournament arc of Vivid is ok though, but it could have been a lot better.</br></br></br>      <br><br>I agree with you at least. <br>Fanservice should always be second to good action and believable character relationships.</br></br></br>  <br> not lewd, so it's bad <br>I didn't say that.<br>Just that they didn't really drew their bodies lewd for the adaptation.</br></br></br>    Best Vivid.    <br>Houki type is always worst.</br>    <br>If it's not bad, then why are you complaining?<br>Do you really expect anime adaptations to be able to match the manga art styles? <br>Because you should stop expecting that. It's dumb to think weekly anime can have drawings with the quality of monthly manga</br></br></br>    <br>I don't really like her for some reason.</br>      <br>No, and you should stop exaggerating my words or playing dumb/intentionally not understanding my complaint.<br>They sure as hell have budget to draw some definitions to the bodies, plump asses and nice thighs, buttcheeks and cameltoes. They are also in the manga as well.<br>But do we get them in the anime? No. Do we get them for any shitty ecchi with cowtit girls? Yes, even if they don't have 1/10th the budget of Prisma Illya.<br>It's a good thing that it's not garbage as ViVid anime was, but it's still a shame they aren't going for nice bodies we could appreciate or service shots of them. I'm a loli body enthusiast, that's important to me.<br>If they went so far with the kiss scene either ways, it wouldn't have hurt them to casually draw their bodies more lewd, and considering the fuckload amount of budget they will eventually have in the action scenes, it wouldn't have hurt the wallet either,</br></br></br></br></br>      I can't believe there's still no BDs for this. They're not even up for preorders, but why? I suppose they will release a BD box eventually, however the fact that they haven't even announced it smells like shitty marketing.    <br>I'm not playing dumb. <br>Don't assume everyone has to understand your shitty logic<br>Also, I don't rermeber Luvia or Rin having ther bodies more defined than the lolis, so stop thinking it's some evil illuminati conspirancy against loli</br></br></br>  <br> normies <br>Posting in an /r9k/ thread.</br></br>    <br> Also, I don't rermeber Luvia or Rin having ther bodies more defined than the lolis, so stop thinking it's some evil illuminati conspirancy against loli <br>No, you misunderstand me. I'm not really angry at Illya, more like I'm disappointed and underwhelmed. It's still alright, but a shame they didn't put a bit of effort into drawing the girls' bodies. All in all, Illya is fine, not good but not inherently bad.<br>ViVid on the other hand is a complete fucking bullshit, that is a worthless pile of shit that completely butchered the loli service on moral grounds, or because the staff was probably disgusted by lolis.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what King Records/Aniplex/Seven Arcs are thinking. It's insane.</br>     downloaded nanoha at the start of the year <br> never ended up watching it <br>Welp<br>I don't think that's going to change any time soon either</br></br></br>  Sette is cute.  <br><br>No fans would buy it, or care.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  /r/ full pic  <br>Delete it.

I love the bits with the Materials in innocent just because of that. </br>  <br>They didn't suffer it quite as hard as the lolis did (Fate did get her service scene, and the ass focus on Teana/Subaru/whichever number in bath scene was more than the lolis got), despite ViVid having more loli service originally.</br>  <br>Damn, I need an anime with Materials.</br>  <br>This.

This is the world that Vita protected, that’s why we can relax like this. <br> Hayate: Ah, I wish we could stay like this forever. <br> Vita: You can, if you want. <br> Hayate: Is that so? <br> Vita: Yeah… </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-2/<br><br> When will Spyro return with the new translations? </br></br></wbr>   Never   <br>What is Iroha supposed to be?

Maybe rejection will facilitate that?</br></br>  What would Yui and Yukino think if they saw 8man playing with Keika? Would they tell Komachi she may have been replaced? Would they get jealous? <br><br>Would they imagine having him care for their own children?</br></br>   no Iroha to look down on me   <br>Not sure how being rejected again will help her grow.<br>Only reason rejection helped HIkki grow was because he was rejected over and over until it didn't even phase him anymore.</br></br>  <br> you will never smell her fluids </br>  <br>Rejection didn't really help him grow though. Just because he was going through some major growing pains before doesn't mean he wasn't still completely stunted by all the rejections.</br>    Couldn't say thanks for the Irohasu thread in time. <br>But yeah, thanks, brothers.<br><br><br><br>Stop it you, I can't do it right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not getting what you want gives people a backbone, there's a reason why spoiled brats exist. Although she doesn't seem like a spoiled brat in terms of physical needs, she isn't well versed in relationships. Might also pass the genuine lesson from Hiratsuka where being in a relationship with someone means you're ready to hurt/get hurt. There's a lot of things that can only be realized through rejection.<br><br>But then again I'm not saying that I don't want Yukino to end up with 8man, I just want both of them to grow which is exactly what the major premise of the story. I would be really happy if all the little things the novel showed be brought up again such as <br> the picture she bought from the Christmas trip show up again in their living room once 8man and her settle down and have a family  <br> having 8man's third question result in not being friends but lovers.  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei and 8man would be head over heels for him. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei <br> Drinks <br> Smokes <br> Ancient anime references <br> Punches <br>Do you really want this?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's not what 8man found alluring in sensei.</br>  <br>She probably can't handle drinks and with her condition smoking is the worst she can do.<br>She does tend to go on rants about the things she likes but not as intense as Hiratsuka does.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but that's the point.</br>  <br>Was it really necessary to continue these threads under a trick like that? Let's just let them die. It's time to move on to new series and new discussions. Really now at this point there's nothing left to discuss about the series. At least the Irohafags are honest about only wanting to waifu worship.</br>  <br>This will happen if 8man rejects Yukino, what will make her realize she is actually Sensei from the past, then they'll battle it out to see who is the real Yukino</br>  <br>We have important things to talk about such as...<br><br>How would Yukino initiate sex? Would she bluntly state her need to have children or would she beat around the bush (like she often does) and imply it only to shyly reject the idea once 8man catches on?<br><br>This is important information dammit!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious how she'll act by the end of the series.</br>  <br>Is that before or after she goes super Yukinon when Hachiman dies?</br>  <br>She would keep teasing him until he's unable to resist. She wouldn't be the first to initiate early on in the relationship.</br>  <br>I think it'll be 90% hormones when she does it, but it'll start with her working a jab at 8man's sexual prowess into her banter and escalate to a "yeah, well prove it" moment when she gets right in 8man's face. Then finally realizes what the hell she's doing and that she really, really wants to pin him down and take a ride on the 8 inches, and from there it's just a matter of who caves first.<br><br>I'm wondering how Yui would work it now too. I think the shy hint-dropping would be more up her alley, though I can see her just showing up in the bedroom in new lingerie and letting nature take its course too.</br></br></br>  Rank the following Yaharis by order of intelligence (currently in random order): Yukino, Yui, Iroha, Hachiman, Saki, Komachi, Sensei, Yumiko, Cunt, Tobe, Zaimokuza, Saika  <br>I'm also quite curious about what their family interactions would be like<br><br> The hikigaya family goes to the beach <br> 8man unconsciously stares at girls <br> "Hachiman, what are you looking at?" <br> "N-nothing really" <br> "Is that so? Hey, have you heard? There were news yesterday that a wife killed her husband" <br>"R-really? why?"<br>"She had believed he had been cheating on him, shows that people shouldn't underestimate a woman's jealousy huh.."<br>"I-I suppose.."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Damn.

You might as well say you like her because of her japanese beauty traits</br></br></br>  <br> Nope, she also wants to be genuine and will be loyal to Hachiman <br>So do the other two girls, and they're the only ones we've seen putting any effort into it.</br></br>  <br>The other girls only want 8man to reach his genuine-ty, what Iroha wants is genuine for herself.<br>If anything, Yui is the biggest transgressor against genuine since she wanted to keep the status quo and I have no idea whats up with Yukino but going back to the destinyland she wants something neither 8man or Haruno have which probably alludes more to independence than something genuine.<br><br>Only Iroha and 8man share the same goal.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Still better than ending up with Iroha. She may want genuine but once she hears another guy getting emotional she'll hop off the 8man train as fast as she hopped off the Hayama train</br></br>  <br> Still better than... <br><br>At least put some effort into defending your waifu</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> thinking 8man wouldn't like Yukino's bitchiness <br>he literally said he liked her bitchiness because it was refreshing and not superficial bullshit, if you think he's going to divorce her because of that you're delusional<br> the only reason they're going to divorce is because he's been accidentally fucking other girls behind her back </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was never a waifufaggot like you, it's just clear to me that unloyal girls aren't worth anyone's time</br>  <br> once she hears another guy getting emotional she'll hop off the 8man train as fast as she hopped off the Hayama train <br><br>how nice you ignored the efforts 8man is spending on Iroha. Helping her win the election, helping her organizing Chrismas event, caring bags, boxes and other things (this is important), remembering birthday etc.<br><br>Traditional and cliche course, but from other (and Iroha) perspectives it's obvious that he is hitting on her (and winning scores also).<br><br>Meanwhile Yukipasta is too busy copy other, and Yui still wet-dreaming about "someday dates"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying I'm a Yukinofag <br>Yes, I meant that once she reaches final form she won't be bitchy anymore to 8man, it's barely a complete change in character</br></br>  You know, I think it's strange how Irohafag arguments against Yui and Yukino as relationship partners never amount to more than meme-tier nonesense like "Copypastanon" and "Yui a dumb"<br><br>It's almost as if they don't have any real ground to stand on or something.</br></br>  <br>She will drive him mad, alright. Just not the way you were hoping for.</br>  <br> he literally said he liked her bitchiness because it was refreshing and not superficial bullshit, if you think he's going to divorce her because of that you're delusional <br>It's refreshing when you only hear them for 1 hour a day in the club room. But hearing the bitching 24/7 after being married? That's the number 1 reason of a divorce<br><br><br>Oh okay, so you are just a shitposter/hater</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> efforts 8man spending on Iroha <br>so the next guy who sees a cute girl and flirts with her she'll fall for? <br> boxes and other things (this is important) <br>you're saying that a for a girl like Iroha, a guy helping her out will win her heart too. If you don't think that's sluttiness then your waifu goggles are on too tight.<br><br>At least the other girls won't whore themselves out, loyalty is miles better than being a slut.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dragging out that poorly written copypasta again?<br><br>I mean the concept is amusing sure, but it's worse than that time I tried to actually read 50 Shades of Grey.</br></br></br>  <br> if he isn't a cancerous waifufaggot he's a shitposter/hater <br>You believe whatever you want, friend.</br></br>  <br>Let it flow.</br>  <br>The truth my dear friend, is that Yuifags and Yukinofags have nothing going on for their generic waifus which leads them to lash against each others and other girls</br>  <br> But hearing the bitching 24/7 after being married? <br>Did you even read the fucking LN? 8man was never tired of her banter. Sure he complained about it but he legitimately enjoys his interaction with her. You have literally no basis for the argument of that he'll leave her if he's bitchy.</br></br>  <br> Implying you aren't a shitposter <br>It's like you don't even read what you post</br></br>  <br>I'm still not hearing any arguments. I'm gonna assume you ran out of them.</br>  This fucking thread.  <br>Why are Yukinofags and Yuifags such slutloving fucks?<br>Give me a proper post and you'll receive a proper reply.</br></br>  yukino with cat ears is too much  <br>Yes, I read the LN. And if your reading comprehension wasn't this low, you would realize I said<br> It's refreshing when you only hear them for 1 hour a day in the club room. <br><br>They don't spend all the day together and banter, they just do it when classes are over and they are in the clubroom. Another different story is when you live 24/7 with someone with whom your only interaction is just insults</br></br></br></br>  <br>Before asking for arguments, present yours instead of this low quality bait</br>  <br>The fact that you're implying waifufaggots aren't shitposters is even worse.<br>And I was just judging the girls based on how I saw them, if you that triggers you I don't give a fuck</br></br>  <br> I can't present any arguments so I'll just call the other girls sluts based on no actual fact <br>Nice one</br></br>  Just posting the best girl  <br>Yukino offers 8man an intellectual equal and a mental sparring partner to keep him on his toes.<br><br>Yui provides him with emotional support and validation that he's sorely in need of along with gentle pushes to become a progressively better person.<br><br>Iroha is cute, manipulative, and claims she wants something genuine.<br><br>And last but not least, 8man actually cares about his relationships with Yukino and Yui.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yui is dumb and wouldn't be able to hold a stimulating conversation with 8man. <br><br> Yukino's feeling are not genuine, she has redistributed her feelings for hayama to 8man (being her white knight and a person she can rely on). Furthermore, she is confusing love with dependency. <br><br> Iroha is still unproven in being genuine. <br><br>That's why he should get together with Saki or just date one of Orimoto's cute friends (Orimoto will be 8man's wingwoman).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you actually think Yukino will be 24/7 bitchy with him? You're lying if you think that every interaction with him is just her 100% insulting him.<br><br>You're also projecting too hard, just because you won't be able to take bitchiness doesn't mean 8man can't. He has taken it and given it back, you have no proof he will leave her if she acts like she does.<br><br>Not to mention if he enters a marriage with her won't he be prepared to face that? Assuming he would be dating her after high school ends, that leaves several years where he would experience it. I'm 100% sure 8man can deal with it, no matter how far you want to project yourself onto him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The fact that you're implying waifufaggots aren't shitposters is even worse. <br> Didn't even present an argument about not being a shitposter <br>Yes, you are a shitposter, and a very retarded one if you are saying all waifufags are shitposters</br></br></br>  <br>Are we reading the same LN?<br> Everytime they talk Yukino throws some insults to him or mocks his family name <br> 8man tries to get back at in his inner monologue but he's too beta to speak his mind <br><br>Apart from the drama dialogues and unfunny cat jokes, she has always talked to him with one-sided insults</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like you beat out Cap Cunt nowadays.</br>  The funny thing is, not once have I talked bad about the YY girls until today and I was proud of that fact.<br>Guess we should let these threads die.</br>  <br>He stopped the cuntkilling after 4 months. These threads should also stop, there's nothing to discuss and 28 IPs after 6 hours is just lame</br>  I didn't see any new Yahari figs in the Wonfes threads yesterday, I thought this series was popular!  <br> Considering that sexualizing the girls brings him PTSD <br>That's only new 8man, he has no problem sexualizing Yukino and Yui in the past.<br>Up until the camping trip he kept trying to etch Yukino half naked figure into his mind.</br></br></br>  <br>You just won't stop, huh?<br><br>Fine, here's your reply, seeing as this is your second attempt this thread.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet she gets disappointed when he doesn't fight back, it's not like she insults him out of malice.<br>Rather she's pretty similar to Haruno in this regard, just like how Haruno likes etasiing and scaring Yukino, Yukino likes to tease Hachiman but she likes it when he at least bites back.</br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> Putting in any effort <br>Don't skip your meds friend, take it from a guy with ADHD.</br></br></br>  <br> girl a draw <br> boy it a call <br>Let we keep do why happening this?</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha <br> loyal <br><br> not a filthy slut who chase after two guys at the same time <br><br>Irohafags sure are delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Implying that isn't the only reason because we love him</br>  <br> Yui is a two-timing slut chasing after 8man and cookie guy <br> Yukino is Hayama's sloppy seconds <br> Iroha is an innocent kouhai who is going after the cool senpai which is usual of cute kouhais, besides if you arent a dense MC you would know this is just a masquerade of her own, extending her slyness even further </br></br></br>    Please don't war about waifus<br>Why can't we just appreciate our 8.8/8 male model Hikigaya-kun? He's leading on three girls at the same time and is going to  reject  them all because he's just that alpha.</br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/oallemjcap.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>This Ikemen</br>  Hello faggots, anyone have the link of 8man and Saika doujin? No sadpanda  <br>Does Iroha still admire Hayama? Yes.<br>Does she still has a shallow crush on him? Quite likely.<br>Has a more serious interest on 8man? Yes.<br>Going after him harder and harder as time passes? Yes.<br>Does she lie about all of those? No.<br><br>Iroha is the most honest one out of the girls, both Yui and Yukino are full of shit. It's almost as if she's  genuine. <br>Besides, Iroha is precisely his type, whether you like it or not.<br>No wonder 8man has no complaints about her and is busy lusting over her, trying not to fall for it while having to deal with double YY bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “Yui’s pretty nice too, but she’s kinda air-headed, ya know?” <br><br> Oh, yeah. She was pretty air-headed. But for someone as idiotic as him to say that was pretty much the pot calling the kettle black. <br><br> “Also, it’s obvious she’s popular, so there’s lots of competition.” <br><br> … <br><br> Well, yeah, I guess <br><br> Nice girls are popular. It’s scary how unpopular and clueless guys are so attracted to them. They reeled you in hook, line and sinker. You ended up blue in the face like Grander Musashi. <br><br> That’s why I won’t get surprised I won’t tremble I won’t get taken off guard I won’t be shocked I won’t tremble I won’t get surprised. What the hell? I was trembling like a leaf. <br><br> Indifferent to my quiet sighing, Tobe went on <br><br>Meh, 8man is such a hypocrite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being genuine and having "something genuine" aren't the same thing.<br><br>8man gave an abstract definition of an idealistic relationship. Just because a person is honest with themselves doesn't mean they'll be able to understand and be understood by others.</br></br></br>  <br>If she was genuine she wouldn't use Hayama as a pretense to get with 8man and actually go after him genuinely. She's his type but he's lusted after the other girls as well. <br><br>And in the end, no matter what you say, he still cares for YY much more than he cares for her, and his limited interaction with her shows it. She needs to jump through a shit ton of hoops to hope to get the feelings 8man has for YY, which is why she has literally no chance of winning.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't genuine, not yet at least.<br>None of the girls are genuine yet except for Miura.</br></br>  <br> And in the end, no matter what you say <br>Welp.<br> he still cares for YY much more than he cares for her, and his limited interaction with her shows it. She needs to jump through a shit ton of hoops to hope to get the feelings 8man has for YY, which is why she has literally no chance of winning <br>Is this going to become a meme?<br><br>Didn't know WW posted here, I'm sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is precisely his type <br>Kek<br><br>Come back when your waifu gets the beauty description like Yukino does.</br></br></br></br>  <br> miura <br> implying <br>if anything it'd be Dayone who is genuine - genuinely gives no fucks.<br>Something is hilarious? laugh at it<br>Something sounds good? preach it<br><br>She's honestly too good for 8man. Glad she isn't part of the 8bowl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No wonder 8man has no complaints about her <br>Because he doesn't care about her enough to complain about her? <br>And if you think she's more genuine than the other girls then you're delusional</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha is much further from genuine than Y+Y, and there's no more damning scene than the cooking class. Almost immediately after 8man inadvertently sideswipes her with his "but I don't hate it" what does she do but run off to Hayama. She's not remotely ready to be honest with her feelings nor do we see any signs that she struggles with the fact that she should be like Y+Y are.<br><br><br> Is this going to become a meme? <br>If calling out things you hate that are blindingly evident is a meme, then yes. It'll probably be the biggest meme since Batman.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I disagree with it so it's a meme <br>Deep down you know it's true, don't be delusional</br></br>  <br>That isn't a type either.<br>8man's real type is someone who will take care of him and let him do what he wants.<br><br>Komachi fills this roll because his mom is always sleeping or working.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Watari's definition of genuine doesn't make any difference when double YY are still fake to the core.<br><br>Being genuine yourself is already a big step foward, regardless of what "something genuine" means to somebody else.<br>8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him.<br><br><br><br>Ayy, we're back at volume 8.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who is this cookie guy you are talking about?</br>  <br>A joke.</br>  <br>Hayama, the answer is always Hayama.<br>Yui wanted cookie man and was trying hard to fit in his group<br>Yukino gave him choco and did who knows what else with him.<br>Iroha wanted him too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> double YY are still fake to the core <br>please justify this claim<br> 8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him. <br>didn't he say himself that he wants to understand, not be understood?<br> Ayy, we're back at volume 8. <br>and you still aren't out of your delusion, are you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Watari's definition of genuine doesn't make any difference when double YY are still fake to the core. <br>Yui and Yukino are in the middle of something called character development. If you're really so shortsighted as to think things won't change then I suggest you read/watch a few more stories to get a better understanding of how literature differs from reality.<br><br> Being genuine yourself is already a big step foward, regardless of what "something genuine" means to somebody else. <br>How would you know? Like I said just because someone is honest with themselves doesn't mean they will suddenly be understood by others or understand others.<br> 8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him. <br>I'm going to need to know why you think that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only reason why you waifufaggots like Iroha is because you're all self inserting and want an aggressive slutty girl to make the first move <br><br> inb4 Iroha has no emotional baggage <br><br>Relationships are all about overcoming those, what do you expect? Happily ever after?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to need to know why you think that. <br>Because she lied to him to get him to do something, which apparently means she understands him.</br></br>    <br><br>Iroha is a fox.</br></br>  <br> "Hikki, here, to thank you for that time." <br><br> And with that said, Yuigahama took something gently out from her bag. A beautiful wrapping that contained cookies was held reverently by both her hands. <br><br>It was just confirmed recently that cookie man is Hikki all along.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No,  Totsuka is the little fox. </br>  I was better off lurking.  <br>A relationship with literally no emotional difficulties is destined to crash really hard in any story<br>8man and Iroha's relationship is no different</br></br>  <br>I am sincerely biting just becasue there is nothing else to fuel these threads: and look, it has even spawned some conversation relating to the current psyche the girls have right now. Maybe it wasn't that bad to contribute to the shitposting a little.</br>  <br>Well, they're right that she understands how 8man thinks, but that's hardly unusual. both Hayama and Haruno have a pretty good grasp of that too, as does Yukino when she's not busy building more pedestals to put him on. Yui understands him too, just on an emotional level instead of an intellectual one.<br><br>The reason Irohafags shout so much about Iroha understanding 8man is because she weaponizes it to get her date. Whether that's anything to actually be proud of is a completely different story though.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, me too. I was totally biting all those times just to makes the threads go longer. I in no way responded for any other purpose.</br>  <br>My brother in arms.<br>We are the real batmans, sacrificing our integrity for the sake of discussion.</br></br>  <br>and they call her the most genuine when she uses Hayama as a front to get closer to 8man<br><br> inb4 3rd grade hikigaya certificate <br><br>that's only because she understood his tendency of being a shut in, but let's be honest. who doesn't out of the three? that line gets way too much credit than what it actually entails.</br></br></br></br></br>  This shit is almost as bad as Haganai threads back then, almost.<br>But it's still a disaster.</br>   we were supposed to be discussing about best guy <br> instead we go back to waifu wars <br>I hope cute coffee fearing 8man will change your minds</br></br>  <br><br><br> disagrees with what is being discussed <br> can't find any arguments against them <br> resorts to posting 3D reaction images straight of funnyjunk instead of just ignoring it <br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets called out on bait <br> continues to bait <br>We get it, you really like the b2b threads</br></br></br>  <br> Sees irrefutable arguments <br> Calls it bait <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br>Yet you keep responding and bumping the thread<br>Again, just because you disagree with it doesn't give you an excuse to shitpost</br></br>  <br> But (surprise, surprise!) this time the rice was damn good. <br><br>8man is a qt when having a crush.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he no longer batman.</br>  <br>Batman can feel emotion<br>but he still does what he as to do, like when he told Yukino do fix her shit herself</br></br>  I don't keep up with these thread so sorry for asking, but has Volume 11 been completely translated yet and If so, where can I find it, since spyro only did chapter 1?  <br>Spyro's been busy with work or some shit. That or Yen Press kidnapped him.</br>  <br>Spyro is dead buddy<br>some anons translated the Iroha spoonfeeding scene, I can't spoonfeed the link to you because I didn't read it<br>they also translated the final scene which I'm too lazy to find</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, that's unfortunate, thanks for the answer.</br></br>  <br> translated the final scene <br><br>http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi</br></br></br>  Anybody got the scans of the BD special volume n ?  <br> kept trying to etch Yukino half naked figure into his mind. <br>I'm interested in Yukino's lack of reaction to this, she didn't get mad, she didn't blush, she just kind of stared back.<br>Second time he does it she doesn't pay his staring any mind.<br>Third time she just casually covers herself up.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people still think 甘すぎだな means the same thing as just 甘すぎ?  Where I can read the raws of the last chapters?  <br>We don't. And I tried talking about his final line "甘すぎだな " on the Iroha thread but there was no interest.<br> I still think he meant "too naive", and not "too sweet". </br></br>  <br>Come back when 8man actually sexualizes Yukino in a recent volume.<br><br><br>8man lied about that. He likes spoiling Komachi, just like he likes spoiling Iroha.<br><br> says Komachi takes care of him <br> yet his "big brother instinct" is always as a caretaker <br><br>8man's central conflict as a character is that he actually wants to be a good person, but he's so jaded/self-conscious that he pretends to be a lazy asshole instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What did sensei imply by this?  <br>That it's fine for them to go at it raw.</br>  <br>Surely they're too smart to try something so risky.</br>  <br>The reason the discussion died is that, as the biggest flag in the series so far, it's been shitposted the hardest. It's also pretty ambiguous.<br><br>That said the statement is too significant for it just to be talking about the chocolate. There is an argument to be made that the word 甘すぎ was never used in the chocolate discussion (嫌い was used instead) as well, so he probably is actually referring to her earlier rejection, thus making "naive" the correct definition.<br><br>That said, the statement itself isn't that important so much as what it's referring to. If it's referring to the rejection then the story is basically asking you to re-examine the rejection, as 8man is retroactively assigning significance to the scene from the beginning. To begin with, the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure 8man will probably sexualize Yukino and Yui in the interlude volumes, he just didn't have time to do it in volume 11 because he was too focused on his actual relationships with them to worry about something as minor as his boner.</br>  <br>He'll keep sexualizing Yui because of her Yuis but he doesn't sexualize Yukino anymore since he seems completly focused on her beauty instead to think of anything like that.</br>  <br>What, a senpai looking after his imouto-tier kouhai is suspicious now? I ask you to reconsider this, my man, for this type of thinking is what lead to British men avoiding helping young children in distress in fear of being accused of being a paedo.<br><br>If you analyze it deeper I'm sure that Iroha and 8man interactions could literally happen with Komachi the same, and therefore remains entirely platonic.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure 8man will probably sexualize Yukino and Yui in the interlude volumes <br>My dad works for Yen Press.<br><br> he was too focused on his actual relationships with them to worry about something as minor as his boner. <br>The irony here is that you're calling their relationship platonic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I was using the term in a more generalized sense to include those.<br><br><br> The irony here is that you're calling their relationship platonic. <br> Romantic relationships are entirely defined by sexual arousal <br>nigga you can't actually be that dumb.<br><br> Holy shit i got a number captcha. Did I go back in time by accident or something? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That said, the statement itself isn't that important so much as what it's referring to. If it's referring to the rejection then the story is basically asking you to re-examine the rejection, as 8man is retroactively assigning significance to the scene from the beginning. To begin with, the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious. <br>That's pretty much what I stated on that thread. He had no reason to just walk up to Iroha and praise her while she's doing her thing.<br><br>Even less reasons to say "too sweet" in the end if he's just done licking the remaining choco and when he loves sweet tasting stuff.<br> There is an argument to be made that the word 甘すぎ was never used in the chocolate discussion (嫌い was used instead) as well, so he probably is actually referring to her earlier rejection, thus making "naive" the correct definition. <br>I like this. Iroha herself asked him if he disliked the sweetness, but we know that she wasn't talking about the damned choco taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious. <br>That was 100% onii-chan instincts. Everything else not so much, but his initial approach was very obviously just him playing the kind older brother.</br></br>  <br> What, a senpai looking after his imouto-tier kouhai is suspicious now? <br>You're ignoring this senpai is 8man, who avoids social interactions like the plague and vehemently denies any kind of positive relationship with Iroha whatsoever.<br><br>You're also ignoring the additional connotations to the compliment he went in with ("You're amazing") which Watari specifically created within the story.<br><br>Iroha immediately rejected him for a reason you know.<br><br> If you analyze it deeper I'm sure that Iroha and 8man interactions could literally happen with Komachi the same, and therefore remains entirely platonic. <br>If it were Komachi he'd say "I love you".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll keep sexualizing Yui because of her Yuis <br><br>I don't think so. Most of time 8man just bothered by her Yuis than sexualizing her because he knew how dangerous it is to him(possible make him out of control) and tries his best to avoid it.<br><br>Just like in this scene. <br><br> Isshiki pulled Yuigahama down and forced her body forward. The added effect of her body leaning forward emphasized her chest and the flickering glimpses of her skin from behind her flapping collars. In keeping my gaze from instinctively latching onto that view, I forcibly turned it away. I won’t lose! Humans won’t lose to things like desires! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he only avoids them because he has been alone, Iroha is something different than just an acquaintance, she's like a second little sister to him -- and 8man is deep down is an amiable man whom if close to will definitely respond with some warmth as he does with double YY.</br>  <br>This general has deprived the ability for me to distinguish whether this is satire or not</br>  <br>That's because you've finally realized that there's legitimate arguments to be made for practically any argument about a character or relationship due to how consistently unclear or ambiguous the author is.</br>  <br>There is literally nothing in this<br> Isshiki pulled Yuigahama down and forced her body forward. The added effect of her body leaning forward emphasized her chest and the flickering glimpses of her skin from behind her flapping collars. In keeping my gaze from instinctively latching onto that view, I forcibly turned it away. I won’t lose! Humans won’t lose to things like desires! <br>That's not sexualized.  What the fuck dude, really? <br>You're blaming WW for being ambiguous even though you are literally retarded to not think that it's not sexualization</br></br></br></br>  <br>That means he still thinks of her Yuis as sexual and fears them as such.<br><br>This is what looking at someone's chest non-sexually looks like.<br> Stop it! Don’t squish Yukinon anymore! She already has to deal with the blowing wind that runs across the open fields of Kanto, namely, her chest! If you’re going to keep pressing her together like that, at least do it in an upwards-like manner! </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure you believe in your opinions very strongly.<br><br>I however choose to understand that there are many different perspectives to be had on any topic and that any one of them could be correct.<br><br>There are times when you can analyze something further to gain a better understanding of it but in cases like this the knowledge gained is all but entirely irrelevant so it's simply not worth it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> legitimate arguments <br> posts 8man sexualizing Yui and say it's not him sexualizing Yui </br></br>  <br>Let's say that they are, Iroha still recognized it as 8man making a pass at her, and it was still significant enough that 8man was thinking about his rejection after the encounter. <br><br>Maybe now that Iroha is aware that 8man has an imouto he dotes on, she drew the connection between that and how he treats her. So when he compliments her, he calls them "sweet nothings", IE she recognizes that 8man's being non-genuine by being affectionate to her like an imouto, and she's telling him that she sees through it.<br><br>Here 8man fails to tsukkomi her rejection for the first time, and just sighs, and she shoves the spoon in his mouth. Maybe she thought he felt the rejection and did it to give him a pat on the back.<br><br>Then there's the chocolate conversation which is significant but I still am not really sure what she's referring to. If anything now it's even more unclear because she could be confirming 8man's feelings toward her, or she could be asking 8man to confirm his feelings toward her. It's really hard to say.<br><br>In any case the scene actually draws a huge parallel between 8man and Iroha, because it turns the tables and says that 8man's (intentionally or not) flirting with Iroha with Komachi as a pretense, whereas the usual interpretation is that Iroha flirts with 8man with Hayama as a pretense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant<br>That doesn't mean you should even remotely entertain retards like this </br></br>  <br> Romantic relationships are entirely defined by sexual arousal <br>Sexual desires are precisely what sets apart platonic and romantic love.</br></br>  <br> Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant <br>Interesting. What is your reasoning behind this statement.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand. Why did they make eye contact after sensei said that?</br>  <br>And yet there is still so much more to them than just sexual desire. It's almost as if romantic relationships aren't defined solely by that one factor.</br>  <br>They considered for a moment what they would do if they didn't have to fear the repercussions of their actions.<br><br>Really though it's probably just to reaffirm that they understood that sensei was talking about the service club's problems.</br></br></br>  IROHA OR DEATH !  <br> Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant <br> this i know btw </br></br>  <br> Iroha accuses 8man of being "sly" on multiple occasions <br><br> Iroha learns 8man has an imouto <br> immediately suspects he's a siscon <br> later gets 8man to declare being a siscon <br> this shows Iroha understands the nature behind how he treats her <br><br> 8man nonchalantly walks up to Iroha and calls her amazing for being able to cook <br> Iroha rejects 8man and calls his compliment "sweet nothings" -- In other words, Iroha rejects 8man for being non-genuine. <br> 8man sighs <br> Iroha shoves the spoon in his mouth to get his attention <br> Asks him if he likes sweetness <br> Asks him if he likes her sweetness/the kind in their relationship <br> 8man answers favorably to both <br> "Thanks for the reference" then immediately drops the conversation to talk to Hayama <br><br>I think I finally understand what happened there. Iroha called 8man out on being non-genuine, then makes him confirm his feelings, then gives him a taste of his own medicine (by pretending their flirting was a reference for Hayama) to show him how he's being "sly" to her.<br><br>Basically the conversation was Iroha saying that she's interested in 8man, but he needs to get his act together first. This is also consistent with how she encouraged him to be a publishing editor in 10.5. She likes him but doesn't want to enable a manchild. 8man's "甘すぎだな" shows that he was contemplating the exchange that took place, showing that she managed to get through to him at least on some level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not up for a philosophical debate<br>I'm just here to shitpost like everyone else</br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't try to communicate such ideas unless you wanted them heard.</br>  <br>Scene was different in the LN.<br> “I see, then let me scold you properly.

If she does any more and I suffer even more body injuries, I’ll become used goods and I’ll have to have you take responsibility and take me for a husband. But wait, that’s actually my goal all along… <br> While I was restless about various things, Yukinoshita looked perfectly calm. <br> “I don’t mind since I’ve never been scolded before.” <br> “Yukinoshita, being scolded isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It just means that someone’s looking out for you.” <br> Yukinoshita’s shoulders dropped slightly from Ms. Shiratsuka’s words. She lowered her head and looked downwards. I hadn’t the slightest idea if something had caught her eyes or not. <br> Ms. Hiratsuka gently patted Yukinoshita’s shoulder. <br> “I’m looking over you, so don’t worry and make all the blunders you want.” <br> We got off the taxi that drove us back and Ms. Hiratsuka began walking in the opposite direction of the hotel. <br> “I’m going to go buy some sake for a good drinking session. See you. Be careful on your way back.” <br> Is that really okay? <br> Ms. Hiratsuka waved her hands and we responded in the same fashion. Yukinoshita and I began walking towards the inn. We were both silent but I felt this was completely natural for the both of us. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yahari Ore no OVERANALYSIS Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru  <br>Yahari is the Monogatari of this generation.</br>  <br>The people that had no idea what happened in this show left ages ago so now we're stuck with faggots that analyze everything.

Why do they like talking about those things so much?” <br> W-What kind of conversation could that be… It wasn’t of any interest to me, but it felt like she’d get angry at me if I asked about it so I kept it to myself. Instead, times like this were where I should say something to ensure my well-being. <br> “Well, you should consider getting into it yourself if you’re going to get asked about it. Not a bad thing, right?” <br> “You talk like it has nothing to do with you. In the first place, during the Culture Festival, you…” <br> The stare that looked down on me turned into a sharp glare that pierced at me halfway through. <br> “M-Me…? No, wait. I’m not at fault here.” <br> I hadn’t a clue what she was referring to, but for now, I made sure to be insistent about it. When I did, Yukinoshita pressed against her temples and closed her eyes. She opened her mouth in resignation. <br> “…It’s nothing.

So I'll go first. <br><br>I'm an Irohafag because I generally prefer younger girls, especially the fun flirty type that like to tease you. I literally can't into serious relationship but having someone to mess around with is pretty fun. I understand that people can fall into situations where until a certain point they can't choose between one person or the other. All those poorfag Iroha theories just sort of make me like her more, it contributes to her character in a way. I like the sweater she wears under her blazer and its long sleeves. I like the colors of her eyes and hair. I'm an absolute sucker for her VA.

What exactly does this sentence translate to?<br><br>"大学の近くに何がありますか。”<br><br>What do you have at Chikaku University...?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not "Chikaku" University. 近く is a word, not a name. Try looking it up.</br>    <br>Woops. I got it now. Thanks.</br>  <br> intermediate listening hell <br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Be very aware that they should not be your only source of studying. I found that the 読解 book is actually a little bit easier than the real N2 test. Complete them and then try to move on to Kaiten Master if you can.</br>  <br>You can hear stuff if it's spoken at non-native speed and with known vocabulary but can't hear anything else without rewinding and looking up words, I presume.</br>  <br>You could almost watch stuff raw, but there's always going to be a few spots per episode where you just can't catch what's said and need to check with subs or replay several times until you get it and it ruins the immersion.<br><br>So basically, normal intermediate hell except with stuff you can't 聞き取る rather than words you don't know.</br></br></br>  <br> Kaiten Master <br>Kanzen Master?</br></br>  <br>Yea that, I've never used it on my own but one of the students in my volunteer class brings in his book. With the teacher there helping us I can understand it, but as a study guide on my own its still a little too advanced</br>  <br><br> tfw never had this or didn't notice it <br>Starting studying after already watching anime raw might have something to do with it</br></br></br>  <br>why dont you just ignore the line you dont get?</br>  <br>Why would you do that? That's like just skipping over vocabulary words when you're reading at an intermediate level. Sure you could still understand most of it, but I don't know how I would improve if I don't try to find out what the hard to hear line was, and then play it a few times until it sounds natural to me.<br><br><br>Well yeah, I started learning japanese when the only anime I had seen was rozen maiden and I watched it with the sound off because I didn't have headphones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because it ruins the immersion?</br>  <br>Not knowing what was said ruins the immersion too.</br>  <br>do you think kids pause a tv show and rewind several times until they understand a word they missed? no. they don't, they just take it and are immersed anyways</br>  <br>No it actually teaches you a good skill to have if you ever actually have a conversation with a Japanese person, becoming good at guessing the meaning. The worst thing is having a conversation come to a halt because you don't understand a word or two. Normal people will just try to end the conversation politely and your friends will just be annoyed</br>  <br>I thought we had all accepted by now that learning languages like kids do isn't very smart.<br><br><br>Yeah so I might as well actually try to improve my listening comprehension when I'm alone watching anime and won't bother anyone by relistening 10 times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you said that it ruins the immersion, but kids do it all the fucking time while still being immersed</br>  <br>Kids are kids, they are used to not understanding shit, because they have to filter shit out every time adults are talking.</br>  <br>go filter it out then you retard. you were a kid, so you did it once before</br>   ～みたい <br> ～らしい <br> ～っぽい <br><br>The meanings all the same to me.

Are you actually suggesting otherwise?</br>  <br>I just looked and it doesn't even have an entry for らしい in the sense that he cares about. You just recommended it without even looking at it, and acted arrogant as fuck while doing so. So please, kill yourself now and do us all a favor.</br>  <br>Suggesting a beginner not worry about learning the nuanced differences between みたい、らしい、っぽい、until they can understand a video on youtube is either stupidity or advertising. <br><br>The concepts are explained well enough for people in English. With your arbitrary reasoning they may as well not study grammar at all and just grok everything till things start to stick.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop lying.</br>  <br> The concepts are explained well enough for people in English. With your arbitrary reasoning they may as well not study grammar at all and just grok everything till things start to stick. <br>No, because I am not advocating against learning them at all. There is a big difference though, in learning something well enough to understand it when reading, and in learning it well enough to use it properly in production. Aiming for the latter as a beginner is a waste, because you're likely to fuck up anyway because of lack of experience, and even if you get it right you'll be fucking everything else up.<br><br>And either way, DOJG just doesn't answer the question, so you just blindly suggesting it for everything is not helpful at all.<br><br><br>Watch the nihongonomori video, then look at DOJG again and show me where it explains the difference like that.

Actually DoJG doesn't seem to have a direct explanation of the contrast between them. I found some information under -ppoi in DoIJG but I didn't find the explanation very clear at all.
