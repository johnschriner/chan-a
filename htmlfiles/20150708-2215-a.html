Thank you.</br></br></br>  Is there a list somewhere of all the Wani artists who are blacklisted from sadpanda? I want to hoard as much shit as possible and I don't like the fact that there's some stuff i can't find on panda, especially dope shit like homunculus.  <br><br>https://www.fakku.net/fakku-books<br>Scroll down.</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br> is incomplete, in some cases incorrect, and wholly misleading.<br>Artists aren't blacklisted, Wani is. Some artists work for other magazines on the side, sometimes artists from other magazines are featured as guests in Wani magazines (recent example: Moketa), and of course any doujinshi an artist does wouldn't fall under that. Going by an artist list is just going to give you headaches.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a damn shame. Is there like some kind of full english translation torrent of those big wani things like x-eros and kairakuten and whatnot? That would be p cool</br>  <br>that's not plump that's fat</br>  <br>i remember playing this way back and it wasn't even translated, anyone get this finished and/or with a 100% save? pls spoonfeed senpai</br>  Joe, tell tenboro to fix thumbnails.  <br>Wait for the patch that supposedly comes out today.</br>  <br><br><br>I think you are the same poster.<br><br> here<br><br>I see no problems with any of these galleries.

Few hours ago they just blocked sadpanda. Where do I learn DNS?  <br>Pretty sure it won't actually be a patch, since Coconut basically had to remake the entire game or something like that.<br><br>It's going to be a full game download, I believe.</br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/830545/499b23<wbr>282b/<br><br>Done with the milfssage.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Drop dead.</br>  <br>It's not wasted to me.</br>  Why are archive downloads sometimes fast and sometimes really fucking slow?  <br>Different servers.</br>  <br>Hah.

Anyone else experiencing this?  Thank you Olympics!  <br>I saw the panda for the first time in years earlier today. I'd apparently been logged out, but luckily the good old cookie method got me back in. It was hella weird.<br>I also changed my password just in case, though I don't know why someone would want my account.</br></br>  <br>Cookies expire after I think a year by default? You can set them to last way longer though.</br>  <br><br>It might be a cookie problem, just accessed it from another browser and it's all fine.</br></br>  What a lovely auntie-type.  <br>Why no one translated that new work? ;_;</br>  Do sb know when Comic Shingeki and Heroine Pinch scans are to be released?  <br>But that's the best part.</br>  Bump with old school yuri<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/810961/1efc2e<wbr>87a2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/740865/588d88<wbr>7322/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/740864/e71c89<wbr>3d4e/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  can't someone explain to me why groups are refusing to translate Wani stuff? just because they can't upload it to sad panda and fakku? I translated a few Wani stories and got PMs telling to just give up because it's a waste of time, those people are such pussies, it's not like there aren't other places to upload porn manga.  <br>Wait, more info on this? There was a guy on /jp/ that was doing an uncensor patch but I thought that died. What's this for? I thought it was already pretty much translated.</br>  <br>Because most of them got DMCAs from Wani last April and chose to obey them.</br>  So how does /a/ feel about Fakku going full Crunchyroll and making a subscription model for Wani mags?  <br>Did someone translate this one? I recall the magazine with it was posted in a previous thread but it got a translate request but I never saw the link</br>  <br>Read the thread.<br><br>Read the archives.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking of http://exhentai.org/s/5fc4c4615b/82<wbr>9259-66<br><br>but thanks for the kind response anyway</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> .rar <br>Please don't use a meme compression</br></br>  <br> wasted <br>I want plebs to leave.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127672144 <br>Kill yourself back to reddit, retard</br>  Any good NTR?  <br> NTR <br> good </br></br>  <br>subsciption is fucking stupid, only casuals (which means all the fakku audience) will go for it.</br>  <br>Subscription is fucking stupid because they won't include the download links and we'll be stuck with 1800px rips which are barely better than japan's 1500px digital releases.</br>  <br> subsciption is fucking stupid <br><br>Have you ever used any subscription services yourself, out of curiosity? I thought the same until I tried out Netflix, and while I have issues with Netflix's quality (mainly subtitle quality), it was very easy to see the value that a catalog rental subscription model can offer.<br><br>And it's really the only way to legally replicate the kind of H-manga reading experience you get illegally with sites like sadpanda etc where you get new content constantly and read said new content without paying for things individually.<br><br><br>The online reading images are going to get a slight bump in resolution soon, but really, 1800px isn't exactly that tiny as it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think most of them just respect Wani's request. If you do scanlations, you know how much time goes into a single release, and if no one will see it, it kinda defeats the purpose (e-peen if you're a cynical leecher, or sharing your labor of love if realistic). <br><br>Some might seriously be scared of legal actions, but that's a fairly unreasonable fear. Fakku won't try to stop you, and you need to make a name for yourself before Wani-senpai notices you.</br></br></br>  <br> shilling intensifies </br>  <br>No download means I won't subscribe.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Daiz. Everyone here wishes you were dead and you know it so the only reason you would come here is to start up shit or shill for Fakku.</br>  <br>I have a 2K monitor. That shit looks tiny.<br>Bump it up to 2400px at least.</br></br>  <br> (e-peen if you're a cynical leecher, or sharing your labor of love if realistic) <br>It's e-peen (or money, or furthering your own abilities), there's nothing cynical about it. Altruism may or may not exist, but if it does, it certainly wouldn't manifest in something as unbelievably tedious as editing manga.</br></br>  <br>Why can't it be a mixture of both?</br>  New lewd moth noises<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/830582/56110a<wbr>0138/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Well, sorry to say, but there's probably never going to be a subscription service that would allow you to download everything.<br><br>I mean, even on the panda you have to pay pandabucks to download things.<br><br><br>There are actually some technical limitations to maximum image size right now due to having to support some older mobile devices. The bump I'm talking about will push it up to basically that limit - going further than that would require more extensive work for the reader to support multiple resolutions for the same pages.<br><br>Anyway, what exactly is your display's resolution and how do tend to read on it? Technically you could count basic 1920x1080 as "2K" already since 3840x2160 is considered "4K". And if you had a say, 2560x1440 display in pivot, with the reader fullscreened and set to fit to width, you'd only need 1440x2036 pages to fill the screen - 1600x2262 in case of 2560x1600 in pivot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean, even on the panda you have to pay pandabucks to download things. <br>except, you know, torrents.</br></br>  <br>Netflix offers a wide variety of genres, while Fakku currently only provides h-manga, and only that of the wani brand.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then the obvious solution is to allow the purchase of individual magazines along side of a subscription service.<br><br>Alternatively, several premium streaming services allow offline access. <br><br>Also, pandabucks is a bit of a strawman. They have torrents and you can download each individual image if you so choose. <br><br>Basically it comes down to how easily can I access the magazines offline? What sort of DRM are we talking about? Will I be able to download individual images fairly easily? DRM is horseshit and you know it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to add that you can rent dvds and blurays from netflix and rip them to your hard drive.</br>  <br>Of course, the perceived quality of the catalog is in direct relation to the perceived value of a catalog rental subscription. But I was talking about the concept of catalog rental subscription in general and how there is value to it.<br><br>Anyway, the point about pandabucks was that online reading and downloading are quite different levels of access, to the point that even a pirate site makes you "pay" individually for their primary direct download method.<br><br><br>Well yes, being able to buy individual magazines (and even individual chapters) would be ideal in my opinion, and hopefully that can happen down the line. I've been pushing for that from the start and I will be pushing for it until it can be made to happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw the thought of renting h magazines just entered my mind </br>  <br> Switching trough crusty pages </br>  <br>July 6th is now over. Still no patch.</br>  <br>So how much DRM are we talking here? If I can rip the magazines without a loss of quality with some scripting, I may consider it. I supported the tank releases since you can download them at full quality DRM-free. I refuse to support anything that impedes the customer from consuming digital goods in their preferred manner. You don't beat piracy by making your content harder to consume. You beat it with ease of access. Why the fuck do companies not realize this?</br>  <br>I just tried playing this and I don't get it. It's really subpar.</br>  <br>It's probably your unmatched shit taste acting up.</br>  <br>It's a catalog rental subscription. You're not supposed to download stuff to own with it. If that's not to your liking, then well, don't subscribe. <br><br>As I said, ideally we would be able to offer individual magazine purchases to have legitimate downloads available too (in my ideal digital distribution model everything should be available for individual purchase with nothing restricted to rental subscription only), but it's not something we can offer right from the start.</br></br></br>  <br> but it's not something we can offer right from the start. <br>Why not, cuntlips?</br></br>  <br>Because the ultimate decision is not ours to make for the content we have.</br>  <br>Probably in the license agreement. <br><br><br><br>I think you should have fought harder for it. I'm pretty disappointed in the decision to use DRM, not going to lie. All it does is drive potential customers away.<br><br>Actually it is your(FAKKU) decision to make since you agreed to the license/contract.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop dodging the issue. Who's decision is it to make and why can't they offer that particular service?</br>  <br>Maybe I didn't play the right game but it was some shitty VN that had Newgrounds level of touche-her-breast gameplay.</br>  <br>I'd like to know what newgrounds games you've playing that have that quality of art and animation, faggot-kun.</br>  Bumping with Watamote: <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/627789/371428<wbr>635b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/575394/00268c<wbr>8d41/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>God damn. Doujin-moe isn't even this fucking bad. At least when you sub to them you can download everything they've done in the past in full quality till your sub is up. This has to be something imposed by wani. I don't believe the guy who preaches about full res highest quality everything would do this without being forced. Of course if it is, you can't say anything. This is fucking dumb though and you know it. I would have subscribed but I was afraid this arbitrary shit would happen.</br>  Hey guys, we just finished QCing this thing. Enjoy. http://exhentai.org/g/830615/ae54da<wbr>d65d/</wbr>  <br>WANI is probably just using FAKKU as a guinea pig to see what works and don't. In the long run, they'll probably terminate the contract and do it themselves.</br>  <br>Well it's 5 pm in here, give it some time.</br>  <br> I think you should have fought harder for it. <br><br>We obviously ask for as much as possible, but this is what we got for now. And as much as it frustrates me, I can understand the cautiousness. Pretty sure a "simulpublishing" deal like this hasn't been made for H-magazines before, and as progressive a company Wani has been with their licensing otherwise, this seems to be their limit at the moment. I'd expect them to relax as we continue to show our prowess, though, which in turn should hopefully allow us to eventually get to the point that is my ideal digital distribution service.<br><br><br>Newflash: Doujin-Moe is a pirate site, and them being able to offer unlimited downloads comes straight from that because they don't have to pay any kind of licensing fees and such. As I said earlier, a legit subscription service where you'd be able to download everything DRM-free is just not something that is going to happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you Daiz.</br>  <br> a legit subscription service where you'd be able to download everything DRM-free is just not something that is going to happen <br><br>Speaking for yourself of course. Lots of really good subscription services do it.</br></br></br>  Reminder to report all shilling and samefagging "discussion".  <br>Like what? Can you name me some that would actually have a larger catalog consisting of multiple artists? Because the only things I know are basically small single-artist kind of things.</br>  <br>W-what<br>Where did you get this, I'm loving that people are starting to translate his manga works.<br>Are you working on it anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Use this actually, http://exhentai.org/g/830618/e0b43d<wbr>381f/ had to change the title and the credits page cause I couldn't be arsed to translate properly.</wbr></br>  <br>I guess I'll just stick with the DRM-free tanks and pirate the magazines, then. Being forced to access content through an online viewer is something I refuse to support. Ideally, there will be enough people like me to make the gap between the subscription model and the DRM-free model large enough for Wani to change their position. I imagine that if the subscription model was super popular, Wani may not budge since they're getting enough money to not justify DRM-free magazine releases.</br>  <br><br> ahegao <br>Bless you anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't talking about hentai specifically. There's music and movie streaming services that offer full drm free download of their entire back catalog starting the moment you sub.</br>  <br> Being forced to access content through an online viewer is something I refuse to support. <br><br>Is the online thing your main issue with it? If that's the case, then yeah, can't really help that. If it's the online viewer, though, then that's something that can be worked on.<br><br><br>Like what? Again, I know stuff like that exists on smaller scale, but I've yet to see any in larger scale myself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> forced to access content through an online viewer <br><br>This. This is the worst part of it. Not gonna fap like some common pleb that doesn't download everything. And you faggots shit on anyone who says they stream anime. Hypocrites.</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of DRM are we talking about here? Does it just not let you save files or does it prevent you from taking monitor screenshots? Some of the DRM image viewers that do let you screenshot don't let you view the original resolution, only a version scaled to your monitor. <br><br>Nevertheless, nothing beats lossless capture cards, unless you take infeasibly drastic measures, so it's all pointless anyway.</br></br></br>   Came so hard that the cum went trough a sock and hit my monitor <br><br>I'm not sure if i should be amazed or worried that my cum is not thick enough.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824456/b4fd03<wbr>dc59/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>No offline access in the program/app of my choice is a no go in my book. Online viewers are not customizeable (filters/interpolation/upscaling/et<wbr>c), and have sluggish performance, especially when seeking.</wbr></br>  <br><br> Newflash: Doujin-Moe is a pirate site <br><br>So is Fakku, right now. This is literally irrefutable, but I know you'll try anyway.</br></br></br></br>  Good things to do after fapping?<br><br>Drink water, what else?</br></br>  <br>Eat something.</br>  <br>Read cute hentai mangos.</br>  <br> new Orutoro <br><br>OH GOD YES</br></br></br>  <br>Clean your onahole.</br>  <br>Take a nap.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Eat the cum for the protein</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dont stand up for atleast 15 minutes, less stand up quick just after you came.</br>  <br>JESUS CHRIST FUCK OFF</br>  <br> Online viewers are not customizeable (filters/interpolation/upscaling/et<wbr>c)</wbr> <br><br>Personally I don't think the lack of customization in scaling filters is an issue as long as the methods used by default are good. Admittedly FAKKU's online reader does currently rely on just browser scaling, but hopefully I can do something about that in the future. Anyway, filtering is really the one big area where providing customization in an online reader would be hard, but otherwise offering customization isn't really any different than offering it in any other reading application.<br><br> and have sluggish performance <br><br>Man, I really should set up an open demo for the FAKKU reader somewhere just so I could ask any random person to take a look at it themselves. But since I sadly don't have that, I can only give you my word that performance has been a major concern in my reader - I want it to perform like a desktop application, and I'd say it does a pretty good at that...<br><br> especially when seeking. <br><br>...albeit admittedly fast seeking (basically holding down next/previous page button) is something it lacks right now (I do have an idea on how to implement that, though). But at least there's chapter points to let you jump around to where you likely want to go anyway quickly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That filename, jesus christ I can't stop laughing.</br>  <br>This is the fucking worst part of owning an onahole. It's not that it's a hassle to clean. It's the shame and embarrassment as you scrape your cum out of a rubber tube and wash it down the drain. I always imagine some sad violin music playing as I'm doing it.</br>  <br>I've never felt this, I actually like seeing how much cum i pumped inside.</br>  Any good vanilla doujins featuring impregnation and pregnant sex?  how often do you have a sad cum  <br>Sure you can optimize your reader, but it will never come close to the features/performance of a dedicated program. And what options do you have if the site is down or you don't currently have internet access (traveling, isp issues, etc)? You lose access to something you paid for. I think paying for something but not owning it is dumb.</br>  <br> that initial load of cum that plops down when you turn it over <br><br>Almost makes me want to go again.</br></br></br>  <br>Never sad just "ruined". Like accidentally closing what you were reading just as you cum because your hands became retarded and now you can't get it open in time because your shaking.</br>  <br>IT'S OUT IT'S OUT IT'S OUT IT'S OUT IT'S OUT IT'S OUT <br>http://belldandy100.tumblr.com/</br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't mind washing them out. I fucking hate drying them though. I've actually been using those tenga eggs recently. They take less prep time and you can reuse them even though they're disposable. Cleaning them is a breeze, too. I just rinse them out and let them air dry on top of some microfiber cloth.</br></br></br>  <br>Time to fap.</br>  <br>Have you even cummed too soon? Cumming during foreplay can be underwhelming.</br>  <br>At least you don't have siblings who takes your stuff without asking.</br>  <br> but it will never come close to the features/performance of a dedicated program. <br><br>I beg to differ on that. The web is a pretty powerful platform these days, you know.<br><br> I think paying for something but not owning it is dumb. <br><br>Well, as I've been saying, it's a catalog RENTAL subscription. You pay a fee to have a rental-like access to a catalog for a limited time. The value of this model has been demonstrated by a great many services. But if you don't want to pay for it, then well, don't. But preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either. <br>At least pretend like you know where you are.</br></br>  Diaz don't you have somewhere better to advertise your shit?  <br><br> people actually spent 2 years translating and decensoring a work whose art looks like it came out 20 years ago <br><br>Why? What a waste.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either. <br><br>Did you really just fucking say this? I really never thought you could shill any harder but you somehow find a way.</br></br></br>  <br>Cool bait dude</br>  <br> At least pretend like you know where you are. <br><br>Well, it doesn't hurt to say it, you know. And there's still plenty of non-Wani content that is not easily legally available, so it's not like it'd be that infeasible of a request.</br></br></br>  <br><br> But preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either. <br><br>Where the fuck do think we are? Holy shit, Sad panda will always be the superior site, fucking kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The web is a pretty powerful platform these days, you know. <br><br>Would you rather stream anime or watch it locally? Talking about home viewing here so don't try and make up some "great if traveling" strawman.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you trying to say that my eyesight is "bait"? Anon please.</br>  <br> But preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either. <br>Has the chemo damaged your brain? Or were you born retarded?</br></br>  does anyone have the translated TOC for Shitsurakuten 2015-06? i was on a trip when it came out and the jews already removed it from the panda. i can't find it anywhere else  Is there a way to filter out fujoshi content in search other than using the '-' function without being reminded of it? Bad thing is that I might miss out on some stuff from time to time if they are tagged wrongly or is only a small portion of it.  <br>Video playback (especially anime/fansub playback) is more complicated that local playback would be preferable due to better availability of technical possibilities, but I wouldn't be opposed to high quality streaming either (think eg. 10-bit HEVC with hardsubbed typesetting and softsubbed dialogue with high quality HTML5 canvas rendering - picture related from some experimenting I did a good while back).<br><br>Manga reading is technically much simpler, though, with scaling algorithms used being basically the most complicated thing involved, and I believe you could get some nice results on that front with WebGL and some shader work.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure the web is powerful, but there will always be high overhead.<br><br>If you don't want me to pirate, use a DRM-free viewer. But of course, you won't do that. I really don't get the logic. You have 3 groups of people interested in the content. One group who doesn't care about offline access, one group who will pirate regardless, and one group who does care about offline access. Group 1 will be paying customers regardless. By trying to deter group 2, you alienate group 3 and they'll just pirate like group 2.</br></br></br>  <br>Tag Flagging perk.</br>  <br>Cover Artist: Inoue Makito (イノウエマキト)<br><br>003 Yumeno Tanuki (夢乃狸)<br>027 momi<br>047 Mario (まりお)<br>067 Deyuyama (でゆ山)<br>085 Saemon (サエモン)<br>103 Yunioshi (ゆにおし)<br>125 Ao Banana (青ばなな)<br>141 Satou Souji (佐藤想次)<br>159 Inoue Makito (イノウエマキト)<br>163 Sayori (さより)<br>171 Meme50 (メメ50)<br>191 utu<br>209 Kotengu (コテング)<br>225 Ma-kurou (まー九郎)<br>243 Tamano Kedama (玉之けだま)<br>261 Komame Maru (こまめ丸)<br>277 Tatsu Tairagi (燵成)<br>295 Syuuen (終焉)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cover - Inoue Makito<br>003 - Yumeno Tanuki<br>027 - momi<br>047 - Mario<br>067 - Deyuyama<br>085 - Saemon<br>103 - Yunioshi<br>125 - Ao Banana<br>141 - Satou Souji<br>159 - Inoue Makito<br>163 - Sayori<br>171 - Meme50<br>191 - utu<br>209 - Kotengu<br>225 - Ma-kurou<br>243 - Tamano Kedama<br>261 - Komame Maru<br>277 - Tatsu Tairagi<br>295 - Syuuen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>thanks</br></br>  <br>Why not just look yourself?<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821996/d26bc3<wbr>c2c3/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Because not everyone thinks the same way as you do.</br>  <br>You know what would be nice since you guys have the originals and all, would be for you to make it possible to turn off the text outside bubbles.</br>  <br>e-hentai filter script + tag flagging perk<br>filter out males_only</br></br>  What the fuck is Daiz doing in a hentai thread??  <br>As I said earlier, if we could serve both 1 and 3, we would, and hopefully we can do that in the future, but for now we'll be only able to serve 1.</br>  <br>I've been waiting for this.</br>  <br>hmm. i thought it wasn't available anymore. i could've swore i searched and didn't find. must've used a blacklisted term.</br>  <br>Can you fuck off?</br>  <br>It's been almost 2 months since the last purge.<br><br> soon </br></br></br>  <br> Do sb know when Comic Shingeki and Heroine Pinch scans are to be released? <br>Shingeki?

The shitty part is really the not being able to also sell the magazines individually DRM-free like with everything else, but given time I believe we'll get there too.</br>  <br>You could always just offer a premium+ style service that includes downloads.</br>  <br>I can't color correct it at all with a ColorMatrix conversion.<br>The difference is this bad:<br>screenshotcomparison.com/comparison<wbr>/134025<br>I just read the lastest Torchlight blog entry (https://mechaweaponsvidya.wordpres<wbr>s.com/2015/05/21/merging-colourimet<wbr>rically-different-sources/) and he seems he didn't manage to color correct CR successfully. So should I let the colors as they are or should I go with MX?<br><br><br>In this case, I'd like to color correct a web stream.<br><br><br>Nothing wrong with it, I wish we would have someone like him in the french fansub scene. Groups here in France are filled with 14 years old fuckers who only know how to rip CR, re-encode their stream and burn their sub in a bitrate starved mp4. The worst is when they're attempting at translating english subs for a show, there's literally a mistake every 3 sentences.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It's 100% malware. Only things I can think of that do that are ones that force you to download their own viewer that basically locks your computer down while it's open.

A service you have to pay to access the downloads is already content protection. I've poured a fair amount of money into hentai over the years and I was mildly optimistic about seeing a lot more translated content from Wani but this is bullshit.<br><br>Stop trying to justify this crap, you're not getting a single cent from me again as long as you're this stupid as to make people pay for online viewer-only. No amount of your shilling or 'but it's HTML5!' will change the fact that it's still a freaking online viewer only.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Quickshot. </br>  <br>I always finish reading whatever I'm reading and go back to the good part first.</br>  <br>Again, sorry to say, but when it comes to a catalog subscription model, it's basically rental or nothing. DRM-free downloads will only be available for individual purchases, and ideally we'll be eventually selling magazines like that as well, but you're just not going to get a catalog subscription with DRM-free downloads.

You can also change pages with Page Up and Page Down, and jump chapters with Home / End (as well as Q and E). Space also works for Next Page. You can also use the scroll wheel to change pages at the top &amp; bottom, though you can turn that off in the options if you wish. F or the button in the top bar to go fullscreen, Enter to hide / show the UI (also toggles via mouse movement and slightly after page changes).<br><br>There's also some touch controls for mobile devices but for some reason this demo version seems to be crashing my phone browser (while the version on FAKKU has no issues) so I don't recommend trying that right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't it say that anywhere on the site? Just says "Download any hentai gallery to your hard drive as a single zip-file which you can keep and view forever." as what you get for subbing.

It doesn't work optimally on laptops though or anything that produces a ton of scroll events, which is why there's an option to turn it off in the settings.<br><br>I do plan on investigating if I could improve on the behavior. If nothing else, I'll probably just make it default to off if tons of scroll events are detected in rapid succession.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127706785 <br><br><br><br> click on NEED HELP? <br> tells me to buy a book if I want help <br>DAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIZZZZZZZ!<wbr>!!!!!<br>Otherwise, it seems fine.

Anyone that did something bad such as being late to class was "punished". Can someone help me remember that title?  <br>It takes under 5 minutes to set it up manually.

I'm glad he's now being published in a magazine, makes him get over his fucking doujinshi and jump on original material.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess its different tastes. The girl is kinda sjitty and the teacher has as much character as a floating dick which makesthe NTR kinda lame.<br>Also tell me your opinions on why the girl still says she loves MC despite being so vile to him and trying to make him raise a bastard child. Maybe you got a bigger insight to this.</br></br>  <br>Dunno if you're still here Daiz (who am I kidding, you have nothing better to do), but when you say DRM are you talking the current reader-only stuff or will you be ramping it up somehow?</br>  Anyone got som NTR artist recommendations with the girl cheating on her husband/ boyfriend willingly without the use of drugs, blackmail or resulting in mindbreak?<br>Kinda like Mizuryu Kei pkus NTR (Im aware that he has some NTR stuff)</br>  <br> Also tell me your opinions on why the girl still says she loves MC despite being so vile to him <br>Because she awoke her sadistic side, possibly? Because she has been drugged and twisted her mind? You can see in the end she went full sadistic and bitch. And this is NTR so of course she will prefer the stealer's cock. You don't have to look further to "understand" this story.<br> and trying to make him raise a bastard child <br>Because it's hot to the reader?

It's definitely worth it since, unless you can read Japanese, it's the only way to finish the series after The Second Raid.</br></br>  <br><br>Steel Ball Mind.</br></br>  <br><br> he later died of a cold </br></br>  <br><br>I just finished that about 30 minutes ago, I thought I'd be crying or depressed, but all I have is a melancholic smile on my face.</br></br>  based best girl  <br>Well it implies that life goes on instead of simply cease to move forward<br><br><br>Mah nigga</br></br></br></br>  I was extremly satisfied with the ending of Gantz.  onanie master kurosawa    <br>the ending was good but the last game was absolute garbage.<br><br><br>Never been so moved by such a short and over the top manga.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Bittersweet ending's are really good when the next best option is a tragedy.</br>  <br>A very satisfying and well thought-out conclusion</br>  I still wanted more but I was alright with it ending.<br><br><br><br>I usually avoid sports-manga like the plague but damn I'm so glad I read this one. The art is amazing.</br></br></br></br>        <br>Sports manga is such a loose term, its ridiculous to call KKNH a sports manga.</br>  <br>Does someone have the Bakuman edit where the Editor says "Mx0 and Double Arts were less interesting than Naruto so we had to cancel them"?</br>  <br>I feel like I recognise this.<br><br>what series?</br></br></br>    <br>That one about an interoverted mountain climber. Think it was base on a real story</br>    <br>Nevermind I found it</br>  <br> he actually died <br>This was such a shitty manga (dropped it I don't remember when) but apparently it concluded with a 10/10 ending.</br></br>  Really? Nobody?<br><br>It was a perfect ending. They brought every plot thread to a close and managed to make the epilogue concise but not feel rushed, so you get closure for everyone.</br></br>  <br>I know, it's usually the competitve ball-sports manga I dislike. Which is why I gave that manga a chance.</br>  <br> You will never be a member of a retired superhero team, now content to relax with your waifu and other hero bros with the knowledge that you saved Earth </br>  <br> Really? Nobody? </br>    <br>I read a few chapters, I thought he was going to end up with the redhead bitch</br>    <br>I rally liked it, There was times when everything was too cute for me, but I accidentally the whole manga.</br>  I really wanted more but I guess the ending was satisfying. It didn't feel rushed either since it was just a SoL  <br>Oi oi, don't joke like that...</br>  Jokes aside, my favorites endings were Shin Angyo Onshi, GTO, PunPun , The world only knows and the more I read I realize that a good manga doesn't necessarily need over one thousand chapters.    <br>Huh? The readhead girl isn't even in the first few volumes.</br>  <br>No wait, ignore that, I suck dicks. You are of course referring to the OTP.</br>    I had to recheck my files this had good endings:<br>Apollos Song<br>The Voynich Hotel<br>Fraken Fran <br>A girl by the Sea <br>Ping Pong<br>Parasite<br>Planetes<br>YKK<br>Sundome, but this one took a while to digest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Franken Fran <br>I don't remember that having much of an ending. Not that it needed one, really.</br></br>    <br>gotta have that trap booty</br>  <br>You finally did it. But still in line with the thread, i mean, no loose ends.</br>    One cant ever expect a good ending nowadays, most of the time one will keep reading even shitty manga and the reason is very simple.  <br>Source?</br>  <br>just found it you fucking fuck<br>don't be a shit</br></br>      <br>he comes back and they get together.<br><br><br><br>I saw only people being upset at that ending and it made me glad I dropped it.<br><br>Here's another satisfying one.<br><br>Some say the story is a bluff, or that they got separated, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Anything from Adachi Mitsuru have a good story.  It was sad to see it end the way it did, but I really, really, really enjoyed Binbougami Ga!'s ending.    <br> Some say the story is a bluff, or that they got separated, but whatever. <br>Honestly, even if they end up separated it's still quite a nice story.<br><br>He grew from his worthless otaku scum self to be a better person, the romance is just a part of that progress.</br></br></br></br>  <br> in the end, nothing actually mattered and she got away with it. <br><br>Just awful.</br></br></br>  <br/>   <br>I got to say even though the final arc was shitty (part from kanchome and the golden book) I cried like a bitch when this happened</br>  <br>*apart</br>  <br>Ending, along with the entire last arc, was fucking shit<br><br><br><br><br>You best be trolling</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>RIS doesn't work for me.</br>  <br> Fraken Fran <br> Good ending </br></br>  <br> Anything from Adachi Mitsuru have a same story <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  The ending of the manga was even happier and more fulfilling than the animu  <br>Both endings were garbage</br>   tfw your waifu will never be your right hand   <br> everyone becomes a god in the final battle <br><br>This annoyed me because of the sheer amount of shonen-y it was.</br></br></br>  <br> The Voynich Hotel <br>Sayman can pump out some satisfying endings. Nickelodeon had some good shit at the end too.</br></br>  <br>Came here to post this. An old man with a puppet shouldn't be able to teach so many life lessons and make you feel so much.</br>  literally 10/10 perfect as a flower  <br>I'm still fucking puzzled as to how he was allowed to do that, but it was fucking great.</br>  The best love story ever told.  Just finished Homunculus and I'm glad I read it.  <br>I liked it better than ichi the killer</br>  <br>I'll give that one a try if it's by the same author.</br>  <br>less metaphors more gore porn coincidentally it also had a stratifying ending</br>    I think this one had a nice pacing and handled out the "drama" nicely enough, AKA in a way that does not make one go nuts.        <br>what is the moral?</br>  <br>Having a "big realization" moment wont suddenly fix everything.</br>  <br>looks familiar, is this from the mayo chicken?</br>    <br>We now bring you Miura's new work: Loli and Gorilla</br>  <br>but there's no way her piss heals right</br>  <br>this</br>      <br>The secret is that she tricked him into thinking her piss is a cure-all, and since he's an idiot, every time he gets hurt he wrings her like a lemon into his mouth. Shes just a fetish pervert.</br>  <br> Meanwhile, shitty moe nonsense thrives <br><br>Mx0 made a lot of use of moe too. Moe isn't your enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>The only chapter I remember the most is the sidekick magnet guy's dream test where he's in a harem.</br>  <br><br>Fullmetal Alchemist has one of the most satisfying Manga endings of all time.</br></br>  <br>Shamo's ending was thematically perfect i loved it.</br>  <br><br>This manga and Holyland were both fantastic.</br></br>  <br>Just finished that 2 weeks ago. Really great read. The last climb was especially exciting because of the larger consequences. I'm just glad towards the end he found his happiness in both family and mountains.</br>  <br>It sure does, Kanye-san</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I've been keeping with the series monthy since chapter 26, literally years of build up to the finale and it was all spectacular.</br></br>  <br>When the lyrics to Amazing Grace appeared I knew it was solidly in my top 10 manga list.</br>  Depressing manga but good ending. 10/10 Revenge  <br>I liked the ending to this. Pic related wasn't the ending but I just like looking at this scene. <br><br><br>my favorite jojo ending</br></br></br></br>  Thank god the brother of the Mc and the goddess saved this manga.  <br>and of course I forgot the pic <br><br>I also really like the ending to onani master kurosawa, slam dunk, and the original dragon ball. Goku outperforming "god" the creator of the dragon balls, finally winning the tournament and to be married soon. Much better the shitty Z ending.</br></br></br>  <br>I appreciated how the manga showed his loneliness. It was much better then say naruto. 8000 flashbacks of him on that stupid swing, and then he suddenly becomes friends with everyone. And even then with other flashbacks it clearly showed he had friends.  sorry to go on a tangent I just really dislike naruto. But I do think the ending was sort of satisfying. With him finally becoming hokage after a long read and all </br>  <br><br>That's because shonen is meant for little boys to read while seinen is targeted to young adults.</br></br>    Endings where all of the enemies and allies of the series come together are fantastic for me  <br><br><br>Ya'll missed out on reading this manga without this perfection in the background. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9<wbr>qvauLlmo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Shit gives me chills and now every time I listen to that song I remember lonely ass Buntarou struggling on a cold mountain and not Interstellar. A good intrumental really enhances the experience its incredible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No luck for me.<br> Sauce? </br></br>  So do we all agree that Kokuo no Hito is one of the best manga of all time?  <br>Isn't the scanlation still not caught up?<br>Talk about spoilers. /a/ was all over this months ago.</br></br>  Couldn't have ended better imo  Suzuka had a pretty good ending!<br><br>well untill, you know. trucks.</br></br>    <br>I can't find the source and I don't wanna be a saucefag, is this a Kiyohiko manga? Looks similar to Yotsuba</br>  <br>A cautionary tale of the dangers of unlicensed hypnotism.</br>  <br>*Kiyohiko Azuma</br>  part V will always be my favorite.  <br><br>that belongs in a series ruined by their sequels thread, like eureka 7</br></br>  <br> Those eyes <br>Greatest running joke.</br></br>    <br>Man, I don't even want to finish that manga after cellphone girl  became god . That multiverse shit was exhausting.</br>  <br>This is mayo chicken.</br>  <br>I still can't believe he dropped Sumire-17, though. The love triangle was kinda fun.<br><br>Not to mention those girls are from 17, which kinda implies 16 is a prequel.</br></br></br>  <br>Soon, Gintama will end.<br>What a beautiful ending it will be</br></br>  <br>Are you trying to make me cry</br>  The whole final chapter was just perfect.  The manga's ending was better than the anime's by an order of magnitude.  <br>Im literally hold off reading/watching so my old friend Gin doesnt break my heart.</br>  <br>Prunus Girl <br><br>Nuff said</br></br></br>    Underrated ending.  <br>i wasn't satisified, we never got to see some trap dick</br>  <br>only thing mashima did that was moderately ok and maybe the first few arcs of fairy shit</br>  <br>There are no beginnings or ends young one. The author needs rest after finishing a manga, but will eventually wake from his slumber and begin the next one. Like an eternal Phoenix dying and rising from the ashes, as long as there's spirit in the hand that hold the pen the flames of passion will never die.</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br><br> we will never get a redo of the anime <br> Viz will never finish publishing the manga <br><br>Why even live?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The final beat down is my favorite in the series. </br>  <br>Finally some posted this one</br>  Has this been posted yet?<br><br>Greatest Magic Girlfriend series ever.</br></br>  <br>what are you talking about, someone already posted it before</br>  The ending fitted it very well  <br> this ending <br> this entire manga <br>I wish there was a short sequel</br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked Akumetsu's ending way more.</br></br>    <br>At this point I would accept a new chapter of Gigantomakhia as a (lesser) substitute to Berserk. Just let us know you're still alive, Miura!</br>  <br>now that's a blast from the past. I remember reading that 8 years ago</br>  <br>Statist please. You fuckers would have me paying for a breathing license.</br>  <br>What a disgusting double entendre.</br>  Fuck you guys for not saying this master piece. Love inuyasha  <br>Fucking this. The ending was the perfect mixture of him finally getting a happy normal life and also getting slightly fucked up go almost abandoning it. I knew he would choose to climb, but I was still mad about it which split me on wanting to see him make it back or to die on the mountain.</br>  <br> magic <br><br>It's a gost uncultured shit</br></br></br>  Still my favorite after 8 years.  <br>The only manga where I was satisfied with the ending was record of a fallen vampire.</br>  Ended just like it started.  <br>Hated this. What a copout.</br>  I know it's not over, but if this had been the ending I wouldn't have been mad.  <br>I almost forgot this existed.</br>  <br>Too Calvin and Hobbes. The whole childhood soldiers on into the big wide world thing has already been done perfectly.</br>  <br>You would have the transgendered planting inappropriate ideas into young minds.</br>  10/10 manga with 10/10 ending  <br>I liked the ending of the novelization better.</br>  It may not have been very long, but Koisome Momiji was fantastic for it's entire run, and the ending was no exception.  <br> mangafox <br>Why do you do this to yourself?</br></br>  Inb4 some faggot says they broke up in real life again.  <br><br>I think I'm the only person in the entire planet who didn't like this manga.</br></br>  <br>Magic girlfriend is a genre. They don't have to be literal maho shoujos.</br>  <br>Fucking this</br>    <br>I know /a/ wont admit this but its naruto</br>  I honestly cried at the end.<br><br><br>My nigger.<br>Truly a great ending.<br><br>They're happy together but you know it won't last.<br>I love how it's not a 'now they'll be happy together forever' like most romances.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the ending for Shigurui was very good.<br>It ended perfectly, without any glamour or excitement, the fight being shit, no one watching understanding the history between those two samurai and it ends with the victor losing everything he had.<br><br>The ending simply reinforced the theme even more.</br></br></br></br>  The only way it could have ended  <br>oh so it's that kind of thread</br>  And the sweetest ending  <br>Everyone was glad that pile of shit finally ended.</br>  <br>that was pretty depressing, though<br> despite the relentless spirit of man, entropy is inevitable </br></br>  <br>no, its by the guy who did silver nina<br>It was translated and dumped on /a/.</br></br>  <br>this<br>epilogues weren't even necessary<br>those color pages would've been the absolute perfect ending to a ghost story</br></br></br>  Its kind sad to go through all the images and realize you were so addicted on going through so many manga out there that you recognize all of them.<br><br>Now I have to wait or search for more obscure ones</br></br>  <br><br>Don't give us that shit. Gorilla is incapable of thinking up an ending, so this will go on forever</br></br>   muh feels   <br>Thank fuck someone else posted this, was the perfect way to end his reign of justice.</br>  <br>I somewhat felt like the ending could have been even darker but the author felt it might have gone too far.<br>Rather than it taking place on an alternate earth, imagine if the whole thing took place on the earth of the main protagonists. <br> Killing millions of his own people, killing most of the planet just so that it can survive. </br></br></br>    <br>I have 668 series to read, plus rec. charts and I am doing a re-read.<br>Scythe.</br></br>  <br>wat</br>    <br>super underrated post right here</br>    <br> yakumo all alone <br>it isn't right anon<br>it isn't right</br></br></br>  <br>I am on the far opposite of the spectrum, too much to read.</br>  <br>well fuck you then.<br>Hope you someday run out like me and wait just like rest of us</br></br>    Nothing tops this ending though.  <br>It was decent.<br>I remember someone here getting really upset that Yusuke ended up as some noodle shack guy, which is retarded because he was never an academic type in the first place.</br></br>  Best girl always win  <br>What happens? I really need to check it out.</br>  <br>Wonder if shin lone wolf and cub is any good?</br>  <br>I originally wanted to see the old guy get fucked up, but after seeing the movie I think that would have been the worse way to end it.</br>    <br><br>they can't break up if they don't exist in the first place</br></br>  <br>My nigga<br><br>Personally, only pic related beats it<br><br>Honestly surprised no one has posted it.</br></br></br></br></br>  It was a pretty mediocre manga, but holy fuck the ending was perfect.  <br>triggered</br>  <br>They were pretty necessary. The ending without the epilogue didn't let us see them interact or explain in any way how their life was going to be. It just ended on her coming back and even subtly implied that she "spirited him away".<br><br>The epilogue makes it clear that she's going to remain on earth as a ghost, but that she's going to live with him, takes back with him, and sleep in his bed every night until he dies.</br></br></br>  <br>The "spirited away" ending was more fitting of a true ghost story, in my opinion.</br>  I wouldn't have minded some more ship fuel tho  <br>I didnt cry at the end. The ending was surprisingly upbeat. <br>I cried when it happened, and it showed Ikuru afterwards, dead to the world</br></br>  <br>You read Mars?<br/></br>  <br>Because it's not good at all. There has been tons of threads about this ending, if you check the archive I'm pretty sure you can realize it's not a good ending.</br>  <br>It is good</br>    Pretty rushed final chapter but good ending  Tezuka always knew how to wrap up a story.  <br>that did not have a satisfying ending, what about best girl akane</br>  <br>Nar, he usually just died before wrapping most things up.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're only familiar with a handful of his 150+ series.</br>  mx0 got axed, and had a shit ending. If that's a good ending, man ...  <br>I wait too, I made the mistake of choosing some series that were not done yet and for sure I wont ever pick up One Piece.<br><br>I thought she was going to disappear and that he in time he would have dealt with it and get together with the...nephew? the parent what's her name.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a joke, he's one of my faves. I'm just salty he never finished phoenix and Dororo.</br>  <br> tfw cant fap because of the feels </br>  <br> pluto <br> mediocre <br><br>it was better than Monster.</br></br></br></br>  <br> better than Monster <br>Please, Monster had a great ending.<br><br>And how do you think love roma had a good ending?<br>It was cute but their relationship was boring as fuck. The story and romance honestly somewhat got stale near the middle and towards the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a Quzilax story, this was downright happy. At least the loli wasn't viciously raped</br>  Ending made me go out and buy all the available volumes.  <br>Any help with this, I tried looking but the closest was Ohno Satoshi but he's a drama actor. A list of completed harem manga isn't that helpful either. I thought I had a close match with ichiban ushiro no daimaou but I'm not sure.</br>  <br><br>Monster is a masterpiece though.</br></br>  <br> good ending <br><br>I'm still fucking pissed that samidare won when snake was best girl.<br><br>what the fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was actually really mad when he decided not to climb at first, like fuck no Mori, don't leave it at that you're finally there. It was an understandable decision but fuck, guess that goes to show tough of a choice it was, the dream he had been holding up to for over a decade or his new found happiness at home.</br>    Happy, cozy ending with a big Gyoza feast, soon.  <br> manga named after main girl <br> worst girl of all <br> dropped it <br><br><br> she didn't win <br><br><br>HOLY SHIT I HAVE TO PICK THIS UP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Artwork looks familiar<br><br><br>Is this the same guy who did High Score Girl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zamurai's final fight was great but it didn't end the way it should've ended. Probably editor pressure because thematically it didn't add up.</br>  <br>How, it was an asspull of astronomic proportions.<br><br> &gt;Build up for a brain anevrism <br> &gt;I'm a doc and I say he's medically dead <br> &gt;FUCK REALITY <br><br>Also Fujisawa is an hack</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When is it ending anyway? I postponed reading it after the boss turned into a devil tube monster.</br>  <br>After chapters of rape suffering, anything was satisfactory</br>  <br>Fuck you, that wasn't satisfying at all<br> he sacrificed himself to save us... <br> timeskip <br> "hey guys, I'm alive, now it's over!" <br>It would have been far more impactful had he just stayed dead<br>Kongou banchou was going downhill before then anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love School Rumble, but I hate how inconsistent the art is.<br><br>Sometimes it's ubercharged, sometimes, he barely draws BGs.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you<br><br>It still hurts they continue Legal Drug and Gate7 over this</br></br></br>    <br>Everything by him has a pleasant ending</br>  <br>How should it have ended according to you?</br>    <br>Shame All of his series are so mediocre to downright bad tho.</br>  <br><br>Last time Gantz was brought up here, I was under the impression that many people were disappointed with it, guess I visited at the wrong time.<br><br>I was also satisfied with the ending, even if a lot of the arcs were weird, with characters that only seemed important  only to die and be revived only to die permanently for sure <br><br>what sealed the deal for me was the entire Muscle Rider scenario, and his personal ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No unexplained survival. That rainy forest had a good atmosphere to just end it right there. A few pages of epilogue showing what happened afterwards were unnecessary. The cat shouldn't have gone on a trip too.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, good stuff.</br>    <br>Nakaba hates to kill his character, like it or not.<br>Coward Banchou's last big battle was completely fucking awesome and Kongou vs his brother is hilariously over the top and fun.</br></br>  <br><br>I've read the first three volumes, and art-wise, it's very good. Similar to Kojima's, but Mori also leaves his own mark on it (and IMO is a better artist overall, and this comes from someone who loves Kojima). Action scenes are also good, and like with the original LWAC, there's just enough esoteric samurai bullshit in it for it to be interesting instead of overwhelming. <br><br>The plot is okay, the biggest problem so far is the characters. The new Wolf is a badass, but he's no Ogami Itto (at least so far), and "dude from Satsuma who speaks local dialect gets dragged into a plot" is simply not as interesting as "ex-Kogi Kaishakunin now works as an assassin to get revenge". Likewise, the new villain(s) don't have shit on the Yagyu. Still, I want to see where it goes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  The only ending that would be fitting for this manga.      <br>lmao</br>    Well, I had a good emotional battery from that ending.  <br>yea but the suffering after that scene made me feel bad</br>  <br>My god. How long has it been.</br>  I'm probably the only one but i like ambiguous &amp; tragic endings. Also i hate :re so i'm biased.  <br><br>Wanted to post that.<br>It was so sad yet so good, all the last 3 volumes were 10/10</br></br></br>      <br>I just funished this. Fuck you, man. Fuck. You.<br><br>I cried.</br></br></br>  I don't have the page but Mushishi had a perfect ending for the story.<br><br><br>Seconding</br></br></br>  <br>I should reread this sometime. I remember the ending almost making me cry.</br>  <br>fuck you</br>  <br>Yeah, last confession and ending were too good.</br>  <br>o i get it, when a story is turning sour, kill everyone and discuss the philosophical nature of life.</br>  It may not be the last page, but it is part of the last chapter and closes the circle in tears  <br>It ends in a cliffhanger.</br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <br>Sakaki Mirei</br>  <br> They fucked <br>I should have expected it but didn't, it was good.</br></br>  <br><br>I still can't believe Yotsuba is still going when Azumanga was a nice and compact 4 volumes.</br></br>  top kek  <br>I have no idea what this is but I can tell it'll piss me off.</br>  Sorry I had to get this from a website but this is one of the best ending I ever experienced<br><br><br> implying we don't need more of Calvin and Hobbes-tier endings </br></br></br>    <br>The best girl won and that guy's just butthurt about it.</br>  <br>Cage of Eden</br>  <br>I've just recently read it. Fucking A-mazing. <br>Never learned how to pronounce the freaking names.</br></br>  It was good, but I blame the piece of shit daughter for all the shit that happened.  I still feel a little sad.<br><br>Watching a character evolve so greatly is the best.</br></br>  <br>Why are so few authors brave enough to ship some characters together before the very end?<br>Hell why are there even fewer who even dares to imply they fucked?<br><br>I've been on an anime and manga hiatus because I became bored of all the stereotypes like the tsundere girl, the slut who is all talk and actually a prude, dumb fucking main characters who is either too dumb to notice a girl like him or is too fucking scared to try, and worst of all the slapstick humor where the girl beat up the guy for accidents he has no control over.<br><br>I just saw Cross Ange who sadly still have most of these stereotypes intact, at least had them fuck and the main guy bragging about it to the villain to provoke him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ is butthurt that he didn't get have his waifu or anhero. They think the artist grill is only keeping him alive for her own well-being.</br>  <br> we never found out what happened to his best friend <br> shoddily resolved <br><br>0/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because pairing to work need development over long periods.<br><br>Most manga's these days either steer clear of shipwreaks or just tease bland one dimentional relationships then either wuss out at the ending or rarely continue with the bad ship regardless and usually throw in something extra sappy at the last second.</br></br></br>  <br>It might have had a good ending if it ended several years earlier instead of flogging the horse untill its bones were dust.</br>    <br>Ah found it, thanks bro</br>  I liked it  <br>Man DtB had such a DtB-ending. Was kinda clear from the beginning that it would be without any explaination though.</br>  <br>Came here to post this.</br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br><br>Gunnm Mars Chronicle.

Tsundere done right.</br>  <br> ending </br>  <br>post the last page</br>  <br><br>Underrated manga.</br></br>    <br>Its not underrated but definitely better than Liar Game.</br>  <br> wanting her to be in a loveless marriage <br>Yuu was always gonna love Samidare before her, better she gets with someone who can appreciate her than will always think of her as second best. Also Catman was cool as fuck</br></br>  <br> want to finish <br> know perfect prostitute is gonna get killed due to faggot mc flexing his muscles <br> refuse to read anymore <br>why must he be such a fucking faggot</br></br></br></br>  Not my favorite manga of all time, but for sure my favorite ending of all time.  <br> 2013 <br>why does it feel like this ended in like 2010<br>2 years seems too short</br></br></br>  <br>Monster did have a great ending<br>but it also had an awful middle filled with unnecessary padding, characters, and plotlines. I love Urasawa's stories but he cant stay on track at fucking all, Pluto is the only one that i'm aware of that doesn't do this shit and that's because he didnt write it.</br></br>  <br>compared to the ending that Asano almost did where punpun falls in front of a train saving sachi's baby this was a great ending.</br>  <br>I'm like halfway through this and love it but stopped a couple months back once i realized it was on its final volume. Did the final chapter come out? I saw one came out last week or so but it wasn't labeled [END] so i figured it wasn't</br>  <br>Its not done, I suggest you keep waiting.</br>  I crei.. 10/10 ending for a short manga..  <br>I enjoyed it more than i expected. Picked up that hardcover localization they did over here and its real nice.<br>Missed alot of stuff my first read too, nice reread</br></br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br> strongest and most inteligent alchemist <br> gives away his power <br>POTTERY</br></br></br>  <br>I never finished the manga (I should pick it up again)but I did finish the movies. Do you know how faithful the last movie is to the manga? It had all this 'black magic' shit in it that didn't seem very lone wolf and cub.</br>  <br>I thought it ended with him literally saying 'You're already dead'</br>  <br>I remember reading an interview between the guys who made those 'even a monkey can draw manga' books and the guy who made Scott Pilgrim. They said they were really impressed how Scott regularly had casual sex and how that would never happen in most manga.</br>  <br>Ditto<br> I do like the whole "we become our own universe" thing from the movie more than Tetsuo and the kids simply dying though. </br></br>  <br>so much effort but i like you</br>  <br>Casual sex is quite common in seinen/josei manga though. It's really only in shounen manga and anime where you get this blueballing and an aversion for actually showing or implying sex.</br>  <br>Sauce, search came up with nothing.</br>  <br>Fuck you, I've been in most Punpun threads, and I know that there are just as many people who liked the ending as there are who disliked it, since it depends a lot on how you think Punpun ended up and this often involves a lot of projection from the reader.</br>  I completely forgot about this until i saw this thread.  <br>Maybe you should stop reading shit.</br>  <br>mate you need to spend more time on mangafox, this is tier 2 entry level stuff</br>  <br>I rarely do that but i went and read it after i saw your post...

There's also a letter at the end that Marii wrote to Gaku in the event of her death, written in broken English, it may make you cry.</br>  <br> implying this, trainman, nurse-kun, oral hygiene brother, or that guy who told stories about the little girl who hated pizza have any basis in reality whatsoever </br>  <br>But MM is based on 2chan posts right?

Even assassins know the might of God Usopp and his 500mil beri bounty    Needs more Gintama, S1 Hayate, and Sket Dance.  <br>I'm not sure why. I know he references Eva because it was important to him personally and influenced his decision to be a mangaka. And, he references KyoAni because he hates them.<br><br>But, I'm not sure about the reasons behind the SEED references.It's not clear to me if the SEED references are because he likes, hates it, or is just using it because of its popularity in Japan.</br></br></br>  Nobody has posted this yet?<br>http://nyaruref.blogspot.fi/2012/04<wbr>/haiyore-nyaruko-san-episode-1.html<wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>He references the older Gundam series like 0079 and Zeta a few times as well, but I just found it kind of funny that he references SEED the most by far.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F9a<wbr>PnqyWoqY</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8cw<wbr>h0mTuFMQ</wbr>  [ ]  <br> saw with my parents and felt uncomfortable being at </br>  Apparently Kinmoza referenced Gundam during the beach episode with Karen saying "Not even my papa hit me!"      <br>Probably Kittan and his goddamn Brooklyn Rage.</br>        <br>I bet you fuckers are wondering why women have never date you and your stuck with 2d waifu</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qBt<wbr>i2QqhSf8</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q_R<wbr>ZRuCa6wU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6J4<wbr>GJ2NSygk</wbr>  [ ]          <br>What did they choose, /a/?</br>    I guess all the ending previews for GDGD Fairies if that show counts.

It doesn't ruin anything for me. People on /a/ act like this incredible story was butchered by alterations made in the dub, but Dragon Ball hadn't been much of an incredible story to begin with(at the very least, after King Picollo died, it'd became standardized and formulaic) and while it wasn't bad, it was far from ruined. Sub or dub, nothing about the core of Dragon Ball Z really changes. And if I recall, nobody complains about the Dragon Ball dub so that can't have been altered much.<br><br>Anyway, enough of the bullshit. Dragon Ball thread I guess. What's your favorite Super Saiyan form, /a/? Mine is Full-power Super Saiyan, since it's basically Super Saiyan 1 and I think SSJ1 had the best hair. Everything afterwards looked a lot more defined and I didn't like how it was shaded then either.</br></br>  The dub is a hot mess, but I love it.  <br> I haven't watched the episode yet. What happened to the dub?</br>  The Kai dub is 10 times better than any other version  <br>Dragon Ball Z in Japanese is worse than any dub could ever hope to be.<br>Dragon Ball Z in English is (these days at least), pretty decent.<br><br>Dragon Ball Z back in the 90s? What an awful dub. Absolutely garbage.</br></br></br></br>   X thread I gues <br>Every single time.</br>  The Dragonball dub is one of the best loved dubs on /a/. The Japanese voice cast weren't very good to begin with, so it was easy to improve on them. Censorship was mostly a non-issue with substitutions that oddly fit the Dragonball universe. We like Mr. "Hercule" Satan, and the Home For Infinite Losers is perhaps the greatest instance of genius to ever come out of a censorship office.<br><br>You might consider going somewhere to fuck yourself.</br></br>  <br> The Dragon Ball dub is one of the best loved dubs on /a/. <br><br>Well clearly not everyone shares this opinion, or this thread wouldn't even exist. Why are you telling someone who shares the same opinion as you to fuck off? The OP clearly appreciates the dub and wants to discuss this appreciation with others. <br><br>You're just a fucking bother. You want to start shit and it's disgusting. YOU go away.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, OP here. Sorry, I butchered my post. I meant to say while Dragon Ball wasn't bad it was far from a masterpiece. <br><br><br>Why do you think being the best loved dubs on /a/(which I'm sure it isn't as I've seen nothing but vehement detractors with the occasional defender in the four years I've been here) means that it doesn't have its detractors? Those are the people I was addressing you fucking beaver.</br></br></br></br>  <br> or this thread wouldn't even exist <br>This thread's existence is the problem. <br><br><br>You're arguing with nobody. Safe your breath for when a significant amount of people actually care.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i think the dub has gotten a lot better, but there's no arguing that certain things are changed/compromised/lost in translation. to watch dragon ball z in japanese is to watch it in its purest form</br>  Ultimate Gohan and weighted clothes are the GOAT transformations<br>SSJ3 Gotenks and Kaioken a close second</br>  <br> And if I recall, nobody complains about the Dragon Ball dub so that can't have been altered much. <br>Watch the dubs with subs on.

Kelamis &gt; Schemmel<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuV<wbr>iG2-w_To</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>You post this in every single thread about Dragon Ball dubs, it's always this same scene, and I never understand why this is suppose to prove that Kelamis is better.</br>  <br>I have yet to see an example</br>  <br>I don't remember the original Funi dub and Ocean dub very well, but the DVD redub is terrible. I actually got into the Japanese version because it was so embarrassing to listen to it. The Kai dub is alright though.</br>  <br>Yeah. But, you see. There's a lot of people who don't just stop there, they have to act as if people who like the Dub or prefer it are lesser than they are or somehow unintelligent.<br><br><br>I also don't agree with that poster. Japanese in sub isn't that bad. It's charming too. I don't dislike Goku's voice actress. He voices Dukemon in the X-Evolution and he sounds fine there.</br></br></br></br>  The English dub completely rewrites several characters, their motivations, and pivotal moments. The voice acting is amateurish, a lot of miscasting, and poor direction. They replaced the orchestral musical score with a bunch of edgy nu-metal-new-age-techno-electronica<wbr>-rock jumble bullshit. A fucking collage of shit. <br><br>The Japanese cast is a who's who of some of the most prolific and talented voice actors in Japan. Putting aside people's stupid fucking opinions about Goku's Japanese voice, you have Ryo Horikawa, Toshio Furukawa, Mayumi Tanaka, Hiromi Tsuru, Shigeru Chiba, Ryusei Nakao, and SO many fucking other amazing super talents. <br><br>Yeah, DBZ is mostly just a dumb action show, without a lot of nuance. But the English dub makes it even dumber, sillier, and more childish, by talking down to the audience. <br><br>But hey, at least the English dub of Kai is decent. Most of the VAs improved, and the script was accurate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br> Stupid opinions about Goku's voice <br>How is it a stupid opinion that multiple extremely strong grown men shouldn't have old women voice them? In the English dubs male characters have women voice actors as children but then changed into men when they grew up why didn't the Japanese versions do the same thing.</br></br>  <br><br>You're missing the whole fucking point of the character. <br><br>And anyway, that's a stupid opinion because Nozawa's adult Goku doesn't sound like her child Goku.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The English dub completely rewrites several characters, their motivations, and pivotal moments. The voice acting is amateurish, a lot of miscasting, and poor direction. They replaced the orchestral musical score with a bunch of edgy nu-metal-new-age-techno-electronica<wbr>-rock jumble bullshit. A fucking collage of shit. </wbr> <br><br>See you think this is talking down to the audience, but none of that is really all that bad when you realize the target audience for the Japanese version of Dragon Ball Z and the English version of Dragon Ball Z is exactly the same. It's for kids up to the age of 15. <br><br>Bruce Faulconer's soundtrack may be shallow at times, but it has some pretty decent songs. Ginyu Transformation, Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Goku's Spirit Bomb, and Gohan fights Frieza are catchy tunes that went well with the moments they were played in. I'd like to say Gohan Angers fits in that list too, but it's pretty repetitive after the opener. <br><br>Your first sentence and the line about the VA casting choice is your only legitimate argument. I don't think people who dislike Goku's voice(while, I personally like it) are stupid though. They have a pretty understandable viewpoint on the whole issue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're missing the whole fucking point of the character <br>Uh, no I'm not. He's an innocent, simple, good person who loves to fight and do the right thing. Goku was never complex as a character.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eRJ<wbr>YbvW_6xk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zaL<wbr>oTA6yICc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Atj<wbr>zxHtj-90</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are several reasons as to why the Japanese do this. In Goku's case, it's to convey the fact that he's innocent, even as an adult.</br>  <br>The whole point of the character is that he should sound like an old woman? Why are you acting like his voice is something fucking symbolic and important to the character it's Dragon Ball Z</br>  <br><br>Which is why the Japanese voice is the better one. Even aside from the pitch, Nozawa's actual delivery, the way Goku speaks, his intonations, how he pronounces words, his speech pattern, it's all very suitable for him. <br><br>English Goku is mostly just "friendly hero guy".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you're responding to, but yeah, you hit the nail on the head(save for the do the right thing part. It's pretty questionable if he loves to do the right thing or just so happens to do it while looking out for himself and his desires). It's Japanese culture and tradition though. Because he's an innocent man they use a woman to voice him.</br>  <br>I like Nozawa Goku both child and adult, but it wouldn't be a betrayal to the character if they got a mature voice for Z Goku. Heck Goku has noticeably matured in Z, for example he does less childish grunts and stops doing the "arararararara" charge chant, he doesn't need to stay high pitched. I think he definitely benefited from getting a deeper voice in the various dubs</br>  <br>They think you're unintelligent because the early dubs of Dragonball Z changed so much that even after 18 years most people who have never read the manga or watched a sub still think goku is a superhero who fights for truth and justice. Just look at the threads sense ROF and Super.</br>  <br><br>Yes and I got that from Goku by, guess what, watching the English dub. Ergo the English dub voice suits him well.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. I'm not disagreeing with you. I think they both suit him. I wouldn't pick one over the other.</br>  <br> Dragon Ball Z in Japanese is worse than any dub could ever hope to be. <br>Disliking the Japanese voice acting in Dragon ball is one of the many absolute marks of a pleb.</br></br>  <br> Aloohibebdbemedbeow </br>  <br>Why is Gohan so fucking pink in that pic?<br>Is he already a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan King God Saiyan thing?</br></br>  <br><br>When they completely remove the original motivation of a character in a scene to push some oversimplified Western-style morality, it fucking deadens the scenes. <br><br>Like that bullshit where Vegeta is crying as he's dying on Namek, and in the dub they make him whine about how he was taken from his father, and never had a chance to be anything but Freeza's tool. <br><br>Bullshit. In the Japanese, he's crying because it's hurting his pride to ask Goku to carry on the task of defeating Freeza. He doesn't want to avenge his father or the Saiyans' lives, but their pride.<br><br>Or Goku sparing Vegeta on Earth because, in the dub, "We have to show him we're better than him." A noble sentiment, but not Goku's way. In the Japanese version, he spares him solely so he can have a rematch, because he enjoys fighting strong guys. <br><br>And all those fucking stupid modern slang and hackey jokey lines about cat food commercials, Freeza needing a countdown, and other stupid nonsense. Funimation was desperate to make it THEIR show and it's arrogant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no one complains about dragon ball sub so that can't have been altered much. <br><br>a little lesson in the dubbing history of Dragon Ball.<br><br> tfw Dragon Ball almost never got dubbed in English  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J9n<wbr>FmkfuNT0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>   more dub pandering on /a/ <br>Honestly you should just have your posting privileges removed if you've ever had sex</br>  <br> 30 year old man sounds like 60 year old woman <br> 16 year old boy sounds like 7 year old boy </br></br>  Dragon Ball dub: not even once.  <br>She might sound like 60 but she's actually almost 80.</br>  <br>define sex. I mean I bumped into a girl on the subway once, I can still post right?</br>  Changing Goku's voice literally makes one of the most important moments in the series not make any sense.  <br>You know what fucking sex means</br>  <br>i've had sex so i cant post anymore then? i dont like that rule</br>    <br>kek</br>  <br> be over 18 <br> was brutally raped by my female PE teacher when 7 <br> anon says I can't post <br><br>but anon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> female PE teacher <br> female <br> PE <br>fake</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then you shouldn't be on /a/. The fact that you've had sex shows you're an insufferable normie scumbag that also has the corresponding normie opinions.<br><br>I bet you prefer the dub. And don't even give me that opinion reversal either.</br></br></br>    <br>Source for the doujin</br>  <br>He probably fucked his sister though Normiescum</br>  <br>Nani?<br>I've had a female gym teacher in elementary school and in high school.</br></br>  <br>trust me they were male anon, did you ever see their vagina?</br>  <br><br> normie <br>Please stay on your containment board.</br></br></br>  <br>It's quite normal have female P.E. instructors here in America. Assuming he is from America</br>  <br>Yeah. When they raped me.</br>  <br>that was an asshole, common mixup, you were raped by a male.</br>  <br>What containment board? If you're not a virgin you don't fucking belong here. This is common knowledge.</br>  <br>/b/culture should stay on /b/</br>  <br>But it looked like this.</br>  <br> Like that bullshit where Vegeta is crying as he's dying on Namek, and in the dub they make him whine about how he was taken from his father, and never had a chance to be anything but Freeza's tool.  <br><br>I don't ever remember him whining about being taken from his dad, so much as how he hated living under Freeza and was mad/devastated he couldn't defeat him. As far as I remember, I've always believed that scene to be about pride. Otherwise, why would he have killed Nappa? <br><br> And all those fucking stupid modern slang and hackey jokey lines about cat food commercials <br><br>I'm surprised anybody remembers this at all.<br><br> Funimation was desperate to make it THEIR show and it's arrogant. <br><br>Again, the target audience is children for both the dub and the sub, and I'm not saying that just gives dubbers free reign to make mistakes, but on this particular note, I'm saying, if they're making something for a Western audience of children to enjoy, instilling in them some Western ideology is not a bad thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Schemmel and Sabat were both 10/10 hires and only faggots of the highest pedigree disagree. It's crazy to think Schemmel was just an intern when he was approached to play Goku.  <br>Except the English voices are vastly superior.</br>  <br>lol i prefer the manga but ya i dont mind the english dub on my dragon box set with the japanese music</br>  <br><br>Yeah, if you're a faggot who's driven by nostalgia and ignores objective fact.</br></br>  <br>The original Funi and Ocean dubs are just god awful and you know it. I don't even have anything against dubs in general and watched DBZ obsessively growing up but even I can see that this is true. The Kai dub is much better overall, not just in the voice acting and casting, but in the writing which just goes to show how much more seriously anime is taken in the West nowadays compared to before.</br>  <br>Not him but barring Goku's dub voice, you at least HAVE to agree that Vegeta's, Hercule's, Piccolo's, Buu's, Cell's and Roshi's voice were all top notch, right?</br>  Reminder that if you like Broly you're gay  <br> Gohan </br>  <br>God tier villains:<br> - Buu (all incarnations except for Evil Buu)<br>- Broly<br>- Beerus (if he even counts)<br>- Pilaf</br></br></br> <br><br>Decent tier:<br> - Imperfect and Perfect Cell<br>- Frieza<br>- Cooler<br>- Android 17<br>- Nappa</br></br></br></br> <br><br>Shit tier:<br>Everyone else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just fucking told you that Broly is gay. Your list and opinions suck by the way.</br>  <br>Good list except for that Broly which just makes you gay</br>  <br>You've got it wrong. Vegeta begs Goku to avenge the Saiyans in the manga. What Funimation did wrong is they took out the line where Goku recognizes that Vegeta is lying. They fixed it in Kai though.</br>  Funimation did plenty of things wrong with their first dub, but they don't even compare to what Toei did wrong with the anime as a whole. Acting like the Japanese anime is the "true" Dragon Ball is missing the point entirely.  <br>Yes, the true Dragon Ball is the manga.</br>   Gokus voice in jap <br>I cant do it. Everything else is fine i just cant deal with that voice.</br>  <br>Wow. An American bastard.<br>Srsly dude your country has ruined dragonball enough there is no need for you to overdo it. Just to make excuse about your country's shitty VA,censorship and failconer shit You are saying that goku's character was not good and you are also degrading the story. I know after frieza arc it was not that good but you are saying characters were bad???? Murican db fans are worst srsly just go and suck Falconers dick and listen to techno shit</br></br>  <br>Falconer is better than the Japanese composer though. It's not even debatable, it's an objective fact.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FxP<wbr>cXCqcKj0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NVO<wbr>NKiV8C-s</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7vf<wbr>khDiSijs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the Japanese OST but Falconer's is superior.

Go back to /v/.<br><br> Garbage synth that was literally always playing, never shut the fuck up even in integral scenes <br> better than anything <br>I don't give a fuck about your nostalgia, you're a dumbass moron. Go back to /v/.<br><br>Reminder that if you <br> like the dub <br> prefer alternate soundtracks <br> like any movies that aren't 14 and 15 <br> prefer Z to DB <br> are a Brolyfag <br><br>Go the FUCK back to </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nostalgiavision running a little strong there, secondary?</br>  <br>( ﾟ∀ﾟ)ｱ　Ｕ　ＭＡＤ</br>  <br> Replacing Soul v.s. Soul with generic guitar noise <br><br>How can there still be people who like Falconer's 'never a quiet moment' music when Funi themselves say his music sucked and he was a horrible person.</br></br></br>  <br>Not at all. Just stating an objective fact.</br>  <br>The only objective fact is your secondary taste.</br>  <br>Yeah a fact. Nostalgia is very strong with op and this one. Grow up dude failconer shit sound like someone took soundtrack from another kiddy show and pasted it into dragonballz. No wonder why everyone calls db fans as nostalgiafag all those nostalgia db fans are from your country and those so called anime "elitist" are also from your country who grew up seeing kiddyballz and now they say that db is really crap and do not even consider it as an anime your country not ruined the series. They also ruined the whole fanbase and show's true spirit. You know sometime ago I showed a clip from dub to my japanese friends they were so disgusted by that ahhhhhhhhhhh and that never ending kiddy music.</br>  <br>You're probably a spic but you're alright. Fuck all morons who actually condone Funi shit.</br>  <br> How can there still be people who like Falconer's 'never a quiet moment' music when Funi themselves say his music sucked and he was a horrible person. <br>That there was never a quiet moment doesn't mean that the music was bad, only that they never fucking stopped playing it.</br></br>  <br> Soul vs. Soul <br>The issue with the DBZ English vs. Japanese soundtrack is the same issue with the English vs. Japanese dub. The original was also bad, so English doesn't need to be very good in order to surpass it.<br>Also it's "vs." not "v.s."</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but let me put it this way, bro. I'd love Falconer's soundtrack even if it had nothing at all to do with DBZ. It's just good in and of itself. Why can't you just admit that you only hate on it because it's use is disrespectful of the original OST?</br>  <br>First of all it was godawful. Save for literally a handful of tracks it was all generic synth that aged like milk over the past 15 years. All that you're hearing is that strong ass nostalgia like a fucking homo.<br><br>Second, do you know what a score is? It's not just the music playing, it's the way a studio uses it. The fact that it never stopped playing is part of the way a score is critiqued.</br></br></br>  <br>Go back to the 90s nostalgic faggot</br>  <br>/b/ has the highest percentage of sexhavers according to a 4chan board survey, while /a/ ranks in one of the lowest. Having sex is a /b/ meme, sorry to break it to you.</br>   Not watching your Anime muted while playing Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.8 and No.19, or alternatively one of his many String Quartets. <br><br> Having the nerve to watch anime on a screen any smaller than 60 inches and at anything less than 720p, without a glass of wine that is at least equal to or above the caliber of Dom Perignon. <br><br> Thinking that you can truly understand the Japanese tongue before having seen the Cherry blossoms in person as they fall upon your cheek while you run in a rushed, yet gingerly manner with toast hanging out of your mouth. <br><br> Thinking that any Anime made by a director that doesn't suffer from depression and works with animators that work less than 18 hours a day should even make it onto your palette let alone be worth your time to judge the audio quality and its various versions. <br><br> Not understanding that Anime was a mistake from the start and that despite the preparations you should make before watching it, mentioned at the beginning of this post, started going downhill (in terms of overall quality) after 1918. <br><br>I knew I was among casuals, just not casuals of this bottom scrapping quality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't be serious.

Children are apparently too dumb to comprehend suspense.<br>So yes, we got wall-to-wall synthesizers and HNGH URGH ARGH from every character whenever there was a reaction shot.<br><br>I really, really, really hated the UNGH URGH HNGH when I watched the show as a kid.

As for the Flipdub your guess is as good as mine.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how many people honestly think this way.</br></br>  <br>Uh yeah, I wonder how many people have the correct opinion of thinking sexhavers and dubwatchers are shit and should die.</br>  I don't hate the dub because it's clear to anyone who's watched it that DBZ is a silly show aimed primarily at children and the dub (or at least the one I watched) complimented that fairly well with all the over the top screaming and speeches.  <br>Dem German openings.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RZ6<wbr>O4yvgQ3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>True that. Now if a dubbing company got their hands on and ruined a series known to be mature and for adults, like One Piece, I'd be furious. One of the main reasons I took up activism, it all started with protesting 4kids, then to kony 2012, and finally I'm a part of anti-gamergate.</br>  <br>Nice b8 m8</br>  <br> Onepiece <br> mature <br>hahahahahahaha</br></br></br>  Since Kai, only thing I can say I legit hate about the dub now is Mr. Buu's voice.  <br>I'm fairly that was what we call "a joke" around these parts<br><br>What it had to do with the original post though I don't know</br></br></br>  <br>you are kidding right???</br>  <br>Goku turning SS the first time was definately the best scene.<br><br>I mean, that scream!</br></br></br>  <br>If Faulcouer was so good why did they never use him for the original series and keep the original OST for it and more importantly, why would they switch him out with a new composer (a worse one) for GT? Why was Faulconer not even considered for Kai even though that was pushed even harder for the Z nostalgia factor even more than Japan was to the point it was renamed as Z Kai?<br><br>The answer: Because everybody realized he was completely shit. <br><br><br>I honestly really don't get how people say Funimation's early dub wasn't as shitty as 4Kids' One Piece. I mean it has the exact same problems<br><br>-Shitty censorship<br>-Changing names<br>-"character" voices<br>-And of course replaced music that doesn't shut up because American kids are dumb right<br><br>By the way, I would totally agree with praising the dub if some of you people were talking about Kai or Battle of Gods. Kai's dub is quite good. But of course, you people never are</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drummonds Vegeta suited Scouter vegeta, I prefer Sabat Vegeta for Cell Saga onwards though</br>  <br>On the topic of Buu's voice, I just want to take a moment to say, he had an AMAZING dub voice.

On the other hand, isn't that the dust jacket, which can be removed from the book itself?</br>  <br>Tokyo-MX's one wasn't censored but I don't think there is an uncensored subbed version yet.

Papi seems to have gotten a design change. Smaller wings and they made her chest bigger.

I think it'd look better with black.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's to holding our breath until episode 2.</br>  <br>I assume is hard to maintain the correct proportions in every scene, just let it go. Perhaps the BDs will fix some details.</br>  Since Mero is getting focus in the next chapter(s), will Suu, Ranch, and Lala get their focus after?<br><br>Specifically for Suu, what could the crabman do?

Hence her petiteness.</br>  <br>I have no idea mate, I have only seen the AT-X version up on nyaa.</br>    <br> Implying I'm not a wizards apprentice <br>It's my subconcious telling me that spiders are the worst creatures to have ever existed on this planet. Jumping spiders look tolerable because of their goofy eyes, but are the worst because they FUCKING JUMP.<br><br>So as great as Rachnee may be, I wouldn't a spider. I'd rather a horse pussy because at least I won't go into a shock if I wake up discovering I'm touching a horse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. I would burn the house down and regret nothing. Don't fuck with an arachnophobic guy.</br>  <br> wake up and discover I'm touching a horse <br>I dunno, it worked in the Godfather.</br></br>  <br>Well, at least she doesn't have two sentient dog heads close to where her pussy is.</br>  Crabman's orcs are male only species, right?  <br>Hopefully not. Poor Elves if that is the case.</br>  <br> Waking up next to Rachnee = heart attack <br> Waking up next to Cerea = death threat <br><br>The reasons why Miia is best girl just keep piling up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about waking up inside Suu?</br>  <br>you would drown anon</br>  <br>Spiders are cute, is just that society and your brain makes them look scary and disgusting, get rid of those.</br>  <br>They could, but you either get steady hand, or a portable cradle system similar to the 3d rapid prototyping structure, so you can robotically move it with smooth, steady strokes.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. There's liquids you can breathe, I'm sure Suu could provide me with oxygen. And nutrients. And handle my waste. And never let me out.</br>  <br>Society or not, nothing keeps you awake at night like seeing a spider slowly descend from your ceiling, especially over your bed. And I have the luck that I live in a country where the spiders are generally small (relatively speaking) and not poisenous. I'd kill myself if I lived in Australia, Africa or South America.</br>  I'm animeonlyfag (only read those mini H things) and this right there is fucking AOTS material.    <br> What if orcs and elves are different genders of the same species? </br>  I just realized that Lala is the only girl that doesn't try to rape Darling  <br>That would be fine.</br>  <br> I'm animeonlyfag <br>You have two options here, mate:<br>1: Leave these threads so you remain unspoiled, as well as untouched by /a/'s inherrent elitism.<br><br>2: Remedy your animeonly syndrome by reading the manga<br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Monster-<wbr>Musume-no-Iru-Nichijou/001?id=11461<wbr>4<br><br>The first episode contained the first two chapters, leading us to believe the anime will follow a two chapters per episode format.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless he dies, then the dullahan raping season begins.</br>  <br>Because she won, no matter what they do.</br>  Only Smith gets to lay on Darling dick.  <br> harem gag manga <br> spoilers <br>Ha.<br>But I'm planning to read this anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that sounds wonderful anon, i wish you the best of luck</br>  <br>I'm actually scared of small insects, but a medium sized one doesn't affect me, this sounds fucked up but is true.</br>  <br> nothing keeps you awake at night like seeing a spider slowly descend from your ceiling, especially over your bed. <br>not wanting rachnee to rape you while you're half asleep, moaning like an idiot while she shoves her pointy fingers up your ass</br></br>  <br>Why is Manako the most sensual in that image?</br>  <br>Male Centaurs in the Crabman universe already behave like orcs, really.</br>  <br>Pretty sure Colombian drug cartels or whoever would use snakes for much the same reason.

I mean, I don't mind spiders, but it's easy to see why others consider them nightmare creatures. They're animals with eight spindly legs, multiple fucking eyes, and fangs for literally drinking prey from the inside out. As if all that wasn't enough nature somehow designed them to be more horrifying by giving them the ability to build an elaborate invisible net to capture victims and then tie them up to eat at their leisure. And if that isn't your brand of terror, there's also ones that just fucking tackle victims, and ones that jump out of a fucking hole like a haunted house monster.</br>  <br>That sounds horrible bro. I'd rather have a delicious Miia cuddle me with her endless tail.</br>  <br>don't forget to mention that they use some sort of hydraulics system for legs support, something unheard of in terrestrial biology</br>  <br>But he's died lots of times and she's always brought him back.</br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE RACHNEE  <br> snakes <br> cuddly <br>When will this meme die?</br></br></br>  <br>CASUAL<br> not wanting rachnee to fuck you piledriver style <br><br>wait how would that work, is that back of her that flexible?</br></br></br></br>  <br>SPIDER BABIES!

So yes.  <br>But this is a safe judgement to make, isn't it? For somebody to dislike something that means so much to me implies that we'd probably disagree on a lot of fundamental concepts. It's almost like a way of weeding out people that I probably don't want to be around anyway. Am I wrong?</br>  <br>That's rich. I bet you're the type of person who says people who give Shinji shit are actually really like him too, when I actually was right all along.<br>Those very eager to defend him saw themselves through him.</br></br>  <br>I can see why people wouldn't like it, but I despise when they don't respect it.<br><br>It terms of animation, music, setting, design, direction, composition... Shit Evangelion is one of the most finely crafted anime ever. Years keep passing and Eva feels still fresh.</br></br></br>  <br>No. I think people who give Shinji shit don't understand what it's like to hate yourself, and how fulfilling it is to overcome that hate. And when people shit all over him, it feels like they're shitting on me, and the obstacles I've overcome.</br>  <br>Honestly, I think I can't like someone who hates Shinji because I associate so strongly with him. It's like they're hating me.</br>  <br>That's exactly how I feel.</br>  <br>Well obviously I do understand if I painted you correctly. Though, while I may understand, that doesn't mean I'm familiar with the sentiment.</br>  If you judge anyone by their opinion on a piece of art then youre a prick OP.  <br>no, it makes you a sperg.</br>  <br>I disagree. People's interpretations and opinions of a piece of art are very telling of their personality. Therefore it's valid to make judgements based on those opinions.</br>  <br>Does it make me an asshole if  Rei best girl? </br>  Does is make me an asshole if I let the air out of tires of cars parked in handicapped places?  <br>Just means you have shit taste.</br>  Sex with Rei<br> She lies there like a dead fish in total silence staring at the ceiling until you finish, then gets up and showers <br>Sex with Asuka<br> Starts off teasing, then starts insulting your performance, then starts getting into it and goes -dere, then has a complete psychotic breakdown and scampers back into the corner to curl into a ball and cry hysterically about why her mother won't love her <br>Sex with Shinji<br> Essentially the same as Asuka, replacing 'mother' with 'father' <br>Sex with Kaworu<br> He shows up out of nowhere and talks dirty into your ear from behind for a while, but then when you turn around to actually do something, a meteor crashes through the ceiling and kills him </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>One of my best friends didn't like eva, he complained the whole time that Shinji was a bitch.<br><br>I secretly resent him now.</br></br></br>  <br>As for being an asshole, I think you only are one if you treat someone worse because they hate Shinji. I think it would be difficult for someone to understand me if they don't like him. It makes them no longer able to be one of my really close friends. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't show them compassion. <br><br>Anyway, just wanted you to know that you are (not) alone.</br></br></br>  <br>Asuka is a bitch. But she's the most well made bitch in anime.</br>  The majority of people only like EVA because they watched it when they were young as fuck and are still riding on the nostalgia or they just want to fit in.  I never thought Eva was terrible, I just didn't enjoy it.<br>Also, Shinji was intolerable until he finally got in the robot but afterwards, he was fine.</br>  <br>That's a really good way of putting it.<br><br> I think it would be difficult for someone to understand me if they don't like him. It makes them no longer able to be one of my really close friends. <br>is exactly how I feel about this. But you're right, I shouldn't hate or otherwise treat someone badly just because they haven't had the same experiences as myself. I guess I should reserve judgement for their actions, not how they feel about something.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hate people who say <br> shinji is a pussy <br> shinji is gay <br> asuka is a bitch <br> rei is autistic <br> hurr le whatdu fuk did I jus watch eoe xd <br> 2deep4u  <br> show nobody understands <br>Because it shows that they gave no attempt to understand the show and instead decided to give a one dimensional shallow analysis</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, of course he's not alone, the de-facto or at least majority personality set for anons browsing here is passivity reminiscient of Shinji. Don't need to go crabbing eachother's cocks about it.</br>  <br>You say that, but the fact that someone else in this cesspool bothered to reach out and say something nice meant a lot to me. Doesn't mean this place needs to turn into a hugbox. It's just nice to get a pat on the back once in a while. We're all in this together.</br>  <br> Doesn't mean this place needs to turn into a hugbox. <br> We're all in this together. <br>Platitudes are a great cornerstone for hugbox construction.</br></br></br>  <br>I instantly shun anyone who  disses mai waifu .</br>  <br>Yes, because part of Eva's message is to try to understand others and coexist with them. Form relationships with them despite the pain it might cause, for the benefits of that companionship are infinitely rewarding. By disliking someone because they don't like Eva, you're rejecting Eva's message and themes as you are rejecting that person instead of learning to try and live with them.</br>  <br>I recently had a dream where Asuka was about to kill herself while Komm Susser Tod was playing in the background, but i talked her down and then we just sat on the beach and watched the sunset and it was perfect</br>  <br>If a show means that much to you then you aren't an asshole. You are pathetic, however, so you'll fit in here.</br>  <br> blogposting </br>  <br>I want to  cry with  Asuka.</br>  <br><br>I had typed out the following in parentheses before coming to a realization:<br>(But how can I learn to live with someone that doesn't appreciate something that's such a solid cornerstone of my life? I feel like if they don't like eva, by extension they don't like me.)<br><br>As I wrote that I realized that I was, like you said, going against the very message that Anno was trying to convey. The pain of dealing with someone that might not totally understand me is worth the love and friendship that they otherwise bring.<br><br>But I still hope that someday I meet a  girl? friend who sees eva in the same light as me.<br><br>inb4 wow OP you're actually a giant faglord</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Oh shush, I've been here for years.

Normally dominant Asuka turns into a scared little sub. <br>Sex with Shinji<br> Admittedly doesn't know much about sex but is incredibly open to influence. He refuses to say no, his boundaries are as endless as you want them to be. <br>Sex with Kaworu<br> Startlingly foreign. You've likely never felt sensations like the ones Kaworu provides.

I'm all for disliking beta characters, but I place Shinji as an exception. He's a 14 year-old boy who hasn't gone through puberty yet being forced into a giant fucking god-knows-what organic mech to fight living nightmares. Being scared in that position is pure instinct and you're insane if you think otherwise. <br><br>I think the impact Eva has had on the anime industry is so immense that it's hard not to respect as a series. Even if you disliked it, I would hope you respect the series for the cultural impact it has made.</br></br></br></br></br>  Best girl.  <br>Holy shit, thank you. I just posted above this saying that there is a difference between respecting and disliking a series. I hate Madoka because I couldn't stand Madoka as a character and her deus ex machina ending. The anime itself is stellar in all aspects, but the plot and characters were not for me.</br>    <br>I hate eva so much, even school days has a better ending and i'm not even joking</br>  <br>Wait, are you talking about EoE or the actual anime ending? Because EoE is pretty fucking legit and the true ending to the series.</br>  <br>I'm the same. I don't like people that defend the rebuilds either though.</br>  <br> think the impact Eva has had on the anime industry is so immense that it's hard not to respect as a series. Even if you disliked it, I would hope you respect the series for the cultural impact it has made. <br><br>I don't see how considering mecha's were good before it. the only thingm it had to offer was a little cunt for brains of an ass faggot who has daddy isssues</br></br></br>  <br>See, that's the exact type of shit I can't seem to wrap my head around. People are fucking relentless against Shinji when he's some boy that's never had an actual father figure thrown into some alien bullshit conspiracy.<br><br>By cultural impact, I was mainly referring to the numerous EVA references you see everywhere in anime because of its popularity. Eva scenes are so memorable that it's extremely apparently when a reference is being made.</br></br></br>  <br>If Shinji was a girl, no one would ever complain against him. It's infuriating, really.</br>  <br>Sometimes I'll just say shit about Shinji to observe the replies. I'm probably the only one who does this though.</br>  <br>you realize he is like the exact opposite of what an antagonist in an anime is supposed to be right?</br>  <br>I'm the same, I legit think it's a masterpiece and people only dislike it to be edgy: it's like saying you dislike the sistine chapel ceiling - only retards would do this.</br>  <br>epic meme i like it</br>  <br>Not the person you replied to, but what do you mean by "exact opposite of what an antagonist in an anime is supposed to be"? Genuinely curious.</br>  <br>Yes he is. He's the protagonist.</br>  <br>I get the whole "GET IN THE FUCKING ROBOT SHINJI" meme can be funny because he's a beta character, but his character has the development that shows reasoning behind why he won't get "into the fucking robot"</br>  <br>Not so much that, sometimes I'll just throw out a really hostile post about Shinji and watch the replies from those who identify with him roll in. Try it out some time.</br>  <br>what I meant was he isn't the type of guy who isn't afraid to take on the whole world, all while being a good leader and being able to get any girl's pussy hot and ready. and I mean ceasar's hot n' ready.</br>  This thread is epic, simply epic.  <br>   I lose all respect for someone instantly if they make fun of Shinj <br>If I'm talking to someone about Evangelion and they make any reference to Shinji being a pussy or the whole "get in the robot" meme I disregard any further opinions they have on the series because it's very likely they missed the entire point.<br><br> Watch Evangelion videos on YouTube <br> Recommended feed is now filled with WHY SHINJI SUCKS, SHINJI IS A PUSSY, WHY WE HATE SHINJI vids <br>God dammit just stop</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because I automatically think someone is an asshole for liking Eva.</br>  <br>The fact that so many professed die hard fans of Eva take the idea that it has a message and that they ought to live by it seriously makes it that much easier to be content in not caring what they think.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You, thank you.</br></br></br></br>  Disliking someone because he likes a series is one thing, disliking someone because he dislikes a series is fucking retarded.  <br>I hate to make a substanceless post, but you fucking stole the words from my mouth. I don't get why so many people buy into platitudes as long as they're flashy.</br>  <br>And what is the point? Is it that Shinji is suppose to be a simpering coward who is intentionally aggravating to watch? If so, it seems they get the point quite well and just dislike the point.</br>  <br>  give a one dimensional shallow analysis <br><br>Many of the characters are one dimensional and shallow though, Asuka in particular. Shinji is a character you could read some complexity into, but the series pretends to examine his mental state more than it really does, and by the end of it there is little about him that is really consistent.</br></br></br>  <br>What're your opinions of Rei, then?</br>   TV series spends several episodes establishing that Shinji cannot swim <br> in End he just drops into the red sea and is totally fine <br>What the fuck Anno?</br></br>  <br>I know, what really gets me though is that Eva is so decidedly ambiguous is so many ways, but its fanbase frequently seems so cocksure of their analysis. Especially when people act like eps 25-26 are trivially good, understandable and leave you with a nice message wrapped up in a bow, when nothing could be further from the case.</br>  <br>I think the messages regarding self-assessment and regarding differentiation were easily observable but the problem is you have faggots extrapolating off so little into nebulous shit theories until you get to the point where they fellate the work so much you wonder if they've ever had a single independent thought cross their brains.</br>  <br>No I'm the same. The way I see it there are two types of people in this world. People that like and understand Eva and people who are fucking idiots that need to have a bullet put in their brains.</br>  <br>Rei is deliberately given a weak governing thought process throughout most of the show.<br><br>The 'original' Rei is just a bizarre character who I won't even try to explain, the body we see through most of the series does have some subtleties to it but is held back from developing until she 'dies' and the whole thing is reset.</br></br></br>  <br>I do not remember this at all.</br>  <br>After choosing to reject Instrumentality he wakes up in the sea next to the fallen Rei head and then it cuts to him on the beach with Asuka.</br>  <br>Leave him be. He's the kind of guy who nitpicks shit like why the blood on Misato's cross doesn't dissolve in the LCL in the cockpit, why the Shinji's tears on Asuka dry up within seconds, and crap.<br>As for that particular scene, I'm of the opinion that he's finally overcome his fears and is about to face the real world. So, he's not afraid of the water because that's how he saw himself when he re-imagined his identity to emerge from Instrumentality.</br></br>  <br> why the blood on Misato's cross doesn't dissolve in the LCL in the cockpit <br>More importantly why doesn't it turn into LCL during Instrumentality?</br></br>  Myuugi will always be the strongest character within the medium along with Hajun.<br><br>Demonbane is NOT capable of killing omnipotents, just like everyone else.</br></br>  <br> I didn't read both source material yet I must shitpost cour 2. <br>Hello again.</br></br>  <br> Believing that Hajun is somewhat equal or nearly equal to Myuugi. <br>This is how to recognize secondary parrot retard.<br> Believeing that Demonbane is not capable of killing omnipotents <br>This is how to recognize a dumb dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hajun <br> Tier 2 wielder ES can easily defeat him <br> Not to mention Demonbane who wield tier minus infinity ES <br> Still think that Myuugi is the strongest character </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off!</br>  <br> Believeing that Demonbane is not capable of killing omnipotents <br> This is how to recognize a dumb dumb. <br><br>You're a complete idiot. Go and look up what omnipotent means before coming bacl.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not Madara <br> ISHYGDDT </br></br>  <br>Stop parroting the same shit when you are the one who didn't play the source material.<br>Also what the fuck is bacl?<br>Is that dumb dumb special words or neologism words made by idiot like you?<br>Go back when you learn basic english spelling.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Believe what you want to believe. Everyone already lost to Demonbane anyway.<br>Demonbane didn't work on the concept or notion of logic and mere things like omnipotent.</br></br>  <br>Madara can't be ranked because his top state of being is unbeatable.</br>  How do I turn a girl into a gyaru?  <br>Can't I just have the middle one with blonde hair and tan skin?<br><br>Yamanba and Manba aren't what I want at all!</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off cancer.<br/></br>  <br>Convince her that she needs a makeover and that she should let you handle it.<br><br> It's been going great with my mother. She is now tanned, dyed her hair blond, and her clothes are getting sexier. Even bought her some leopard print underwear. The only thing that is really missing is the make-up but I'm working on that. <br><br>So to make this thread more /a/ related, what are you guys favorite Gyaru character?
