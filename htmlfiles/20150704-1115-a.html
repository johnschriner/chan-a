It isn't hard for me to imagine Reina drooling over the idea of  Tuxedo  Taki</br>  What a fucking fantastic show this turned out to be.  So how was the threads on ep 13 airing day? Was the yuri discussed more or the solo?  <br>I saw Taki's design yesterday and I gotta say it wouldn't be as hard for me to picture him with Reina had Kyoani kept that design.</br>  <br><br>I'm gonna say that this one counts since it got me Kaori.</br></br>  <br><br>You should be ashamed of your garbage taste in chinese cartoons.</br></br>  <br>There was a bunch of "/u/ BTFO" posts, but most people focused on the solo. No one discussed yuri. That only started like 8 hours after episode aired when someone posted the spoiler of the novel version of the reconciliation scene.</br>  <br><br>Ep:13 Shoe1 &gt; Taki &gt; Shoe1</br></br>  Why is Taki such a faggot  <br>I don't understand you, Anon. How could you not have been hitting F5 on nyaa all day when Ep13 aired?<br><br>How are you not excited?</br></br></br>   people still watch this garbage <br>For what purpose?</br>  Club President should have gotten the solo.  Is the OST out yet and where do i find it?  <br>They're slowpokes.</br>  <br>But he's not. A he's a real man.</br>   You will never have a bunch of qt high school girls get moist as fuck when you show up in a tux   <br>This shows how he'll never be over his wife. He could have any pussy he wanted, but he's still single and kidless, the poor fuck.</br>  <br>I see. Well that solo part was so beautiful</br>  <br><br>The female sensei must be going out of her mind having to work with a such a young, hot stud.</br></br>  <br><br>I know this is animu, but some of the girls in the band are obscene as fuck. Kaori, Asuka and Reina. I said godamn.</br></br>  <br><br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN<br><br><br> and Reina on the otherhand does a haunted house. Reina gives Shuuichi two tickets and tells her to invite Kumiko. And Reina dresses up like the girl from the Grudge and then scares Kumiko so hard that she grabs Shuuichi by the arm and runs out as fast as she can. <br><br>Reina being a bro. Shame it won't be animated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka's story won't be animated <br> KyoAni will never get to the point when the novels do play the Hibike!

They could make that story the season 2 OVA.</br>  I'm a Kyoanus baby. Do they really change a lot in their novel adaptations? How accurate is this show? Where do I get spoilers?  <br> How accurate is this show? <br>Who cares, it's probably better than the novels anyway.</br></br>  <br><br>How can you say that when you havent read it anyway. Nevermind found some decent results in google.</br></br>  <br>They toned down MC's attraction to her love interest (or to be more precise, they made it more ambiguous) and added even more yuri bait than there was in the source material. <br>Other than that, it's the exact same story. None of the major events were changed.</br></br>  <br>K-On lucky star Haruhi clannad kanon were better than their source material.</br>  <br>90% accuracy.<br><br>FYI : I read the book.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Read for yourself.<br><br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Hibike!_Euphonium</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>How long does it take those nerds to translate novels in general?

Every-time I lurk there it's always the same shit with /a/.</br></br>  <br>Of course. They're trying to put their shitty shipping agenda in the novels and when someone defies their narrative they get buttblasted.</br>  <br>Novelanon mentioned something about her own story where she re-realises her passion for the trombone after losing her way.</br>  <br>Will she be that intense while giving BJs?</br>    <br>Why?</br>  <br>Don't you remember a novelfag who kept coming up with bullshit about what was happening in the Machine Doll light novels?</br>  <br>Don't you see the fags at animesuki? they're all rooting for kumiko and Reina.

No one cares what animesuki or MAL or ANN has to say.  I hope someone translates the mango while we wait for season 2.  Please let there be season 2  ;_;    <br>How far along is the manga, and who's making the manga?<br>I mean, who's the "publisher", the book people or Kyoani people?<br>Hoping for book people because it might mean the manga might cover the entire story and not just the first volume like the anime.</br></br></br>  <br><br> How far along is the manga <br><br>The end of Agata festival.</br></br></br></br>  <br> this is my first Kyoani show <br>Thanks for letting us know.</br></br>    <br><br>I hope that crepe scene gets animated.</br></br>  One more series added to the list of anime Kyoani will never release a sequel for.  <br><br>If Kyoani will just keep on trolling us with KumiRei and then have her lust for Taki afterwards then never mind.

What's it about?</br></br>  apparently I'm in trouble for playing favoritism so I need to redraw the power level ranking, because it honestly should go something like<br> Asuka <br> Mizore <br> Reina <br> Nozomi <br> Midori <br> the rest of you losers <br><br>Turns out Reina can also play the piano and violin at a competitive level, fucking show off. This was before she met Taki sensei too. Girl's just plain obsessed with music.

I will die.</br>  <br>Nozomi best girl.</br>  <br>she started with piano, and then moved onto violin, and then her dad taught her the trumpet which she's been practicing since. She probably doesn't play violin anymore though. Reina used to perform in piano concerts though when she was in elementary school. And she's pretty rich too so she has a house full of instruments and a soundproof room.</br>  <br>She's the greatest.</br>  Whats the relationship between Nozomi and Mizore? Are there any cute moment for either of them in the novel? <br><br>Also is Nozomi and Natsuki's relationship funny? Like Natsuki's relationship with Yuuko.</br></br>  <br>The greatest spoiled brat with special snowflake syndrome in the series.</br>  <br>Literally daddy's little princess</br>  <br>It's true love. She's rich, talented, young, beautiful yet she wants to be special for the old fart.<br>If that isn't tru rabu for you then you must be fucked up in the head.</br></br>  <br>I wonder how many millions of yen daddy spent on buying his little princess lego.<br><br>I'd like to see her lego room.</br></br></br>    <br>Sounds to me she has a father complex.</br>  <br>Funnily enough, Asuka is actually an improvement here since she doesn't seem out of place like she does in the original version.</br>  <br>Did her dad abuse her or was out of her life during her childhood?</br>  <br>I'm sensing he neglect her of something.</br>  <br> she's pretty rich <br>How much is a professional trumpeter makes? A trumpeter is just one of a bunch orchestra players that nobody listen, right?</br></br>    <br>He must be an outstanding player.</br>  <br>He's trained classically and he's trained contemporaneously</br>  <br>Hazuki isn't relevant in the story after Shuuichi but she has a lot of short stories 4 of them are Hazuki/Midori centered and two of them are just for her. And of course appearances in the other ones.<br><br>The first one is about Hazuki and Midori discussing shoujo manga. Midori is obsessed with shoujo and Hazuki is a shounen reader. So Midori starts lending Hazuki shoujo manga which leads to Hazuki asking Midori to explain what kabedon is. So Midori gets Goto to kabedon Riko and it doesn't go that great. And then Asuka joins and kabedons Riko and Riko has to cover her face with both hands. And then Natsuki tells Goto he's going to lose his girlfriend to Asuka at this rate.<br><br>The two Hazuki focused short stories are called ”好きな人の好きな人" or "the person whom you like likes" or something like that. The first half is about Hazuki and her interactions with Shuuichi which leads her to falling in love with him and talking to Midori about it. Hazuki doesn't know what love is so Midori has to explain it to her, embarrassingly. The second half is basically the festival episode but much longer. It includes the scene where Hazuki actually invites Shuuichi to the festival. Shuuichi actually turns her down at first but Hazuki keeps asking and he agrees.<br><br>Then there's Complex, which is from Midori's PoV. Midori talks about how she hates her name but Hazuki was the first person who thought it was cool which is why Midori likes Hazuki so much. Also Hazuki points out that her name should be Emerald. Hazuki talks about things she doesnt like about herself, like her high pitched voice or the fact that she's very tan from being in the tennis club, and that she doesn't think she's cute.<br><br>The other ones are just appearances, like in the school festival, Kumiko Midori and Hazuki run a maid cafe. Midori wears the maid outfit but Hazuki wears a waiter outfit because she thinks the maid outfit is too cute for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So Midori gets Goto to kabedon Riko and it doesn't go that great. And then Asuka joins and kabedons Riko and Riko has to cover her face with both hands. And then Natsuki tells Goto he's going to lose his girlfriend to Asuka at this rate. </br>  <br> giving her ice cream <br>Is Opal retarded ?</br></br>  <br> Midori is obsessed with shoujo <br>Does Sapphire-chan ever get a love interest?<br>Does she interfere with other people's relationships besides Hazuki's crush on Shuichi?</br></br></br>  <br> Hazuki isn't relevant in the story after Shuuichi  <br>And best girl gets unappreciated again.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127518925 <br>ded</br>  <br>It only took twelve hours for mods to delete a literal /b/ tier post.<br>Now if only mods weren't completely incompetent and banned every single retard that rolled.</br></br>  <br>You mean 3 people in total like Shapire AND Hazuki <br><br><br>Silly anon.<br><br>Silly. Making us believe she could possible be better than a prodigy as Asuka and oboechan</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Midori never gets a love interest although she really wants one. She keeps telling Goto and Riko to get married which almost becomes a running joke when Kumiko tells Goto and Riko to get married already too. And she ships Taki and Reina after finding out Reina likes Taki sensei. But she only finds out when its all over so it doesn't go anywhere.</br>  <br> Hazuki isn't relevant in the story after Shuuichi <br><br>Can worst girl be any more useless?</br></br></br>  I was wondering where 100 posts went  <br> Does Sapphire-chan ever get a love interest? <br><br>Hazuki is basically her love interest. Is it any surprise that because no one else will spend any time with them they settled for each other? It's one of the side effects of joining a band: you eventually become a lesbian. Why do you think so many of the girls are so desperate for boys to join? They want to romantically hitched before it permanently sets in.</br></br></br>  What the fuck is this fucking doubles shit. Can't I even for the final ep come here anymore without losing my shit.<br><br>Fuck you niggers.</br></br>  Does Oboe get love or is she stuck with her middle school peers.  <br>Which characters know that Reina likes Taki-Sensei? Sapphire, Kumiko, and Hazuki? Does anyone else finds out?</br>  <br>I felt like /a/ had finally gotten over post number nonsense but it's been creeping back the last few months for whatever reason.</br>  <br> And she's pretty rich too so she has a house full of instruments and a soundproof room <br>Being rich must be nice.</br></br>  <br>well I purposely avoid this question because everytime I talk about Taki and Reina somebody on a board nearby gets angry about it. And then they will go on a long argument that sinks the thread.<br><br>But if I had to say something, Reina likes mature and confident men I guess. Reina hates most people her age, they're brats who need to gang up on people and pat eachother on the back to survive. I can never imagine Reina getting together with normal kids unless she's going to stop being special, at which point she's no longer Reina. She's grown up knowing Taki sensei and Taki sensei is a great guy. I mean they'd be the perfect power couple if they get together. Yes Taki's musical talents are also a big deal to her but it's Taki's personality that Reina likes. Taki's unwavering smile and his of "course we can do it" attitude. And through your own effort too, not just being a hugbox about it when you lose. Reina's dad also speaks highly of Taki sensei to her so Reina's impression of him got even better. So it's only natural she's fall for the guy. <br><br>Yes I guess you could say this whole "love" is shallow because it doesnt have any magical moments or much interaction and it's one sided, but this is Reina's love and she is very serious about it. Also any further discussion of the topic of love will end in blogging so lets just leave it at that. Also Reina's not an idiot about the whole thing, she knows that the age difference between them is a problem, she even gets depressed when Taki sensei hangs out with a woman his own age because the reality of the situation only hits her even harder. But she still doesn't give up, which is the great thing about Reina.<br><br>For the record I do love these two together but whether or not they will get together is anyone's guess. Reina Love Story never.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Noice.</br></br>  <br>/u/ btfo ^^</br>  <br>Finally. That makes sense honestly. Thank you.</br>  <br> Reina Love Story never <br><br>This movie would be the pinnacle of the animation history holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br> the age difference between them is a problem <br>Not really, especially in a culture like Japan's where traditionally it would be quite normal for and older man to take a young wife.</br></br>  Anyone else here for the episode screening?<br><br> mfw I was second-to-last person before the room hit the cap </br></br>  <br>Mizore and Nozomi are childhood friends, Mizore has an unhealthy obsession with Nozomi which leads to them having a falling out after the incident in freshmen year. They get lots of cute moments eventually but if there is a s2, they'll spend 11/13 episodes avoiding eachother. <br><br>Natsuki idolizes Nozomi so they don't do any stuff like how Natsuki teases Yuuko. They're quite close friends though, you could kind of see them as Kaori and Yuuko since Natsuki stands up for Nozomi against Asuka.</br></br></br>  This Q&amp;A session is awkward as fuck. <br>http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/6612<wbr>3452</wbr></br>  <br>what episode screening?</br>  <br>What are the cute moments? They aren't unhealthy after the drama right?<br><br>Natsuki does a Yuuko? I wonder how that goes.</br></br></br>  <br>Any H!E relevant questions and answers?</br>  <br><br>They're showing episode 8 at AX before they bring Kurosawa out for questions.</br></br>  <br><br> any word on season 2? <br>Executive producer: we hope so.<br><br>The rest of the questions were retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh cool</br>  <br> The rest of the questions were retarded. <br>Those are the best ones.<br>What were they?<br>Any log so I don't have to watch the whole video?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Executive producer: we hope so. </br>    <br>I'LL be her love interest.</br>  <br>This is epic m8!!</br>   so obviously there's some sort of attraction between Kumiko and Reina <br>Kurosawa: maybeeeee<br><br>God I love this woman</br></br></br>  <br>All girls are bisexual by nature, so Kumiko and Reina being a bit attracted to each other is normal.</br>  <br>Stream?<br>Any other questions?</br></br>  <br>Something tells me that there's going to be a doujin with this exact line.</br>  <br>no they're fine afterwards<br><br> School festival story <br> &gt;Natsuki and Mizore do a crepe cafe <br> Yuuko visits the crepe cafe and Natsuki gives her a "special service" strawberry crepe, which involves putting so much cream on top that Yuuko can't see even see the crepe. Yuuko still eats the entire thing because she didn't want to lose to Natsuki while Natsuki is just being smug the entire time about it. Mizore sees Yuuko and Natsuko doing this, and Mizore asks Nozomi if she wants a special service crepe too but Nozomi says she's fine with a normal crepe. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These four have cute subtext and chemistry, I knew liking Natsuki was a good choice.</br>  <br> Reina Love Story never. <br>I'll change that. I swear. Even if it takes me a year and everybody lost interest already.<br>I'll do it.</br></br></br>  <br> Nozomi refuses Mizore's special service crepe <br><br>Being Mizore is so much suffering.</br></br></br>  <br>What a bunch of little liars. The English relationship chart clearly says that they are attracted to one another other. <br><br> Translation: it was all bait. </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Continuation: she said that Kumiko's attraction was probably chuuni-related. Like, the strive to become special or something, I'm not too sure. (But she definitely mentioned the word "chuunibyou")<br>Off the top of my head:<br> what kind of direction did you have for all the noises Kumiko makes? <br>Kumiko is very indecisive, sometimes she says yes when she really means no, so I tried to reflect that with her expressions.<br> how much of your former acting career helps your voice acting? <br>A lot. Especially since I no longer have to worry about what the rest of my body is doing.<br><br>obviously I'm paraphrasing heavily.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who's that? <br><br>Simpsons animator and episode director</br></br></br>  <br> They're showing episode 8 at AX before they bring Kurosawa out for questions. <br><br>Damn, I want to hear audience reactions on that particular scene</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.<br>Were those three only questions or were there more?</br></br>  <br> A lot. Especially since I no longer have to worry about what the rest of my body is doing. <br><br>Oh indeed!</br></br></br>  <br>Why isn't there one between Yuuko and Kaori?</br>  <br> Kumiko is very indecisive, sometimes she says yes when she really means no, so I tried to reflect that with her expressions. <br><br>Someone fucking give Kumiko VA an award already for gods sake.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone obnoxiously yelled out "LESBIANS!" after Kumiko said she was going with Reina.<br><br><br>She was also asked what roles she would like to take in the future, but I honestly don't remember her response. Something about trying something new, but I'll still be the same voice actor? I don't know. They did some canned questions before the fan questions that I don't remember either.</br></br></br></br>   when someone mentioned her and reina she said they have a really special relationship and they “could have been lovers in a past life” <br><br>Interesting.</br></br>  <br>/u/ got BTFO</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127518925 <br>god the picture is terrible.

Too much nationalism and bullshit politics with otaku pandering in one episode.  <br>Cry more murrican</br>  <br>It's tied with Gangsta for worst first ep of the season.</br>  Symphogear GX best first episode  <br> Too much nationalism <br>I really hope you aren't american because if you are, that would be ironic</br></br>  <br>You're delusional anon Gangsta first episode may have been average but it was in no way as shit as Gate. At least the former doesn't have forced nationalism. <br><br>Also Classroom Crisis was completely boring.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I ain't even American faggot.</br>  <br>There is basically no one subbing this then?</br>  <br>Should i watch that?</br>  <br>Triple tie between gangsta, gate and gakkou gurashi</br>  lol, no  <br>Anon, Gangsta was visually ugly and lifeless and filled with boring characters and crime cliches. And the action is shit. It's trash.</br>  <br> worst episode <br><br>Have you even SEEN the summer line up? I'm not saying this is the best, but holy shit it looks like a gem in the rough</br></br></br>  <br>It was still average so stop over exaggerating. Have you seen Gate anon that show was literally dull and boring. I'll admit that Gangsta's first episode wasn't that great but it was nowhere as bad as Gate.</br>    <br> literally dull and boring <br>Just like Gangsta, hence the tie.</br></br>  <br> 1115 posts <br> 173 unique posters <br><br>ALL DAT SHITPOSTIN</br></br></br></br>  Gate's author reminds me of that guy who joined a sports team for one year, never trained, never really played, and then talked about how intense and tough it was, and posts inspirational videos on his facebook all fucking day<br><br>Jsdf is a meme army in real life<br><br> inb4 just the anime is bad  <br>The whole thing is dumb, if you can admit that and still enjoy it then all the power to you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The second number is images you fool</br>  This sounds just like http://www.tboverse.us/HPCAFORUM/ph<wbr>pBB3/viewforum.php?f=29 with added moe/otaku bait.</wbr>  <br><br><br>If you honestly think that Chaos Dragon wasn't the worst fucking episode ever, you are damaged in the brain department for sure.</br></br></br>  <br> Fantasy Monsters geting BTFO by Soldiers with M249 LMG'S <br> Bad </br></br>  Pretty much one of the worst first episodes I've seen in a long time  ppppppfffFFFTTTTTT<br><br>I've been able to ignore said bullshit politics for most of this, but I can only take so much.</br></br>  <br>Tell me more about how they portray nationalism in this first episode. I thought they're going to show that in later episodes?</br>  <br>Are you implying that the honorable Japanese would ever sink to the level of lesser nations?</br>  <br>gonna start watching this now... but no way is as bad as Gangsta, that was garbage tier</br>  <br><br>Jokes on you, I'm korean-canadian.</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of Outbreak Company, but a lot more focused on the military aspect. Also a lot less fun.</br>  <br>I dont understand the gangsta hate. It was extremely average. Nothing crazy, passable animation, fairly generic characters.</br>  It's confirmed <br>Gate threads will be guaranteed hives of shitpost</br>  <br><br>What forced nationalism? I'm actually serious because there was none this episode.<br><br>If you need to make things up in order to hate the show just don't watch it and do something better with your time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that comfort women never happened.</br>  <br>I guess no one know you're a dog in the internet.</br>  <br>This. Korean and Chinese women are huge whores.</br>  <br>good thing I'm dropping this after ep 1.<br><br>I mean I'm willing to go through shitposting if the show is at least somewhat decent, but this is beyond masochism, christ</br></br></br>  <br>Then I bet Japan will love this series.</br>  <br> korean <br>Invalid post.</br></br>  <br>why the only complain that people have about gate always is UUUUHHH TOOO MUCHHH NATIONALISMM DO NOT WATCH/READ<br>lololol murica always put nationalism in EVERYTHING for example in every sci-fi movie murica is always the good guys and they always save the planet<br>what is the problem if now japan has an anime like that?</br></br></br>  <br> worst first ep of the season. <br>Ushio to Tora exists, so nope.</br></br>  <br>Because America truly is the savior of the world while Japan is just some shitty island that draws cartoon porn.</br>  <br>You are both savage countries with shit culture. European masterrace here, literally.</br>  <br>Your country is flooded with niggers,nothing great about that.</br>  nippon stronk  OP apparently hasn't watch classroom crisis. Holy shit what a letdown.  <br> nationalism <br><br>Why are you so butthurt about this? It's a japanese animation made for a japanese audience, why can't it be nationalistic?</br></br></br>  <br> korean <br>Even worse</br></br>  <br>I watched CC just after Gate and actually thought it was great, just because Gate was so shit, even though rationally, it was a huge letdown</br>  You can tell that theres a bunch of retarded butthurt Koreans and Chinese ITT.<br><br>You shouldn't be watching anime and stop fapping to Japanese women.</br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>But that's the whole point of the show. <br><br>Outbreak Company did it better.</br></br></br>  <br> worst first episode <br> not even more than 10 relevant shows have aired yet, much less been subbed <br>Fuck off back to /v/ cunt</br></br></br>  <br><br>Let the Nips be free to celebrate the beauty of guns!</br></br>  <br>So everything's a delusion due to him hitting his head right?<br><br>Also 3 months have passed where is the American occupation around the gate?</br></br></br>  <br>Just confess that you are angry because the Gothic Loli didn't show up.<br><br>Because I am.</br></br></br>  <br> Too much nationalism and bullshit politics with otaku pandering <br>That's literally what Gate is about</br></br>  <br> Fantasy Monsters geting BTFO by Soldiers with M249 LMG'S <br> no gore <br>i hate it when people hype for a show based on expectation</br></br></br>  I miss outbreak company  <br> Is 1 good or 5 good? </br>  <br>This, fucking this.</br>  <br>the autofellatio gets to the poiint where the suspension of disbelief ends<br><br>i can accept if japan likes to pretend it's a competent military nation and not a land of betas but i can only accept so much nippon stronk before i start laughing ag the absurdity</br></br></br>  <br> Too much nationalism and bullshit politics with otaku pandering in one episode. <br><br>Agree on the otaku pandering, but there was almost no nationalism. Not that nationalism is a bad thing in the first place too.</br></br></br>  The MC's almond shaped head was seriously bothering me.  <br> but there was almost no nationalism <br><br>Abe pls<br><br> random gate opens <br> fuck that it's part of Japan now, let's go invade <br> NIHON, FUCK YEAH </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was way better than Gangsta and better than Ranpo Kitan's first episode, but that will likely end up being the better show.  <br>It's called Minimi.</br>  <br>That's hardly nationalism. They even considering to blow up the gate.</br>  <br>Gate's first episode was much better than Classroom Crisis's.</br>  <br>So what was Japan laughing about?</br>  <br> I miss outbreak company <br>Damn, Gate is Outbreak Company told from a different angle  but without demi-elf fuckpuppets  at least so far.  </br></br>  <br>I imagine it's something like ﻿ｔｈａｔ ｗａｓ ｓｈｉｔ ｗｗｗｗｗ</br>  <br> &gt;fuck that it's part of Japan now, let's go invade <br><br>Well yes. Unprovoked attack with many civilian victims and the intent of colonization, the rational response is to wreck their shit. <br><br>Pity they left out all the gore and pic related.</br></br></br></br></br>  How do I fix the fucking banding, This is a joke.  <br>madVR</br>  <br> Can We All Agree That Gate Had The Worst First Episode. <br>no, it was fine.</br></br>  <br>That's literally what any fucking country would do.<br><br>Pretty funny that the JSDF are even allowed to go through though, America would instantly demand that the gate is theirs and Japan would turn it over instantly.</br></br></br>  <br>Have it.<br><br>default debanding strength on low.<br>strength during fade in/out high.<br><br>Funi make me fucking sick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Funi <br>This is CR m8</br></br>   tfw their smartphone games are better than our AAA   <br>well in the manga the Americans said to only be giving weapons and supplies (suppose to anyway)<br><br>though trust me this show is written by an ex JSDF so don't take any representation of foreign nations to seriously unless you plan on shitposting</br></br></br>  <br>Oh so it is, Well this a surprise. CR usually looks decent.</br>  <br>The fuck you are even talking about?<br>I'm someone who normally really hates nationalism for the sake of pandering and muh pride, but this was fucking perfect.</br></br>  <br>Even Outbreak Company figured out something that basic, the nips are covering up the magic portal in that universe.<br><br>This is probably going to be an utter trainwreck, but I need goth loli.</br></br></br>  <br>butthurt murican</br>  <br>Britbong please</br>  <br>nice bait. <br><br>it wasn't anything special, frankly it left a very poor impression on me, but it was no where near as painful to watch as that wannabe black lagoon, er i mean "Gangsta."</br></br></br>  <br> that ED <br>I couldn't stop laughing.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded?<br>What would you have done? Wait until some other Gate opens and let a few more of your civilians get slaughtered instead of taking the fight to the enemy?<br>Are you swede by chance?</br></br></br>  <br>The anime was licensed by Sentai. They encode and sub the series for Crunchyroll.</br>   Modern warfare is superior to magic bullshit <br> Magic loli can slay entire untits <br><br>I have problems to grasp the "balance" of this series. The premise is nice, but those are too extremes that are difficult to manage.<br><br>I mean, the entire point is that the modern soldiers can compete fantasy with ease, but then you have a magic character that can obliterate modern soldiers...all the point is lost then, magical land just would need to send some lv99 mages to obliterate all the forces.<br><br>If you go with the premise, that is interesting, stick with that and don't spoil it even before starting.<br><br>For the rest...was an episode full of...nothing. Not the wrost first impression, but definetively didn't was a good one either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> this already happens <br><br>http://arunrajagopal.com/2012/01/31<wbr>/finnairsocialmediacontentstrateg/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Autist murrican  <br> Being this assblasted <br><br>TOP KEK</br></br></br></br>   MC is an otaku <br>My sides every tiem</br>  <br>Fist episode WAS shit, I was thinking it for the whole 20 minutes.

I mean what a genius he must be, who could've ever thought of that brilliant strategy?</br></br></br>  <br>It's slow first episode. More action next ep.</br>  <br>Well, I knew the militarism part was going to suck (because japanese), but the surprise suckiness was the horrible direction in the first ~8 minutes, staying too long on meaningless shots, trying and failing so hard to make the beginning of the invasion terrifying, going as far as to do a full barrel roll with the viewpoint, overall a mess which didn't help the beginning of an anime you didn't get into with the best of expectations.<br><br>That aspect at least got better from one moment to another, only the beginning was intentionally boring you enough to drop it right there.<br><br>Also, lol at that phone call, they want to imply it was the emperor, but they can't even refer to him because japan.

This is at least decent.</br></br>  <br>So basically he's a Gary Stu then?</br>  <br>This is a shit season full of moeshit garbage. Rewatch LoGH</br>  <br>If I heard a fantasy civilization existed with a population that isn't full human I would ask myself that too.</br>  When will the Americans just fuck off?  <br> savior of the world <br> lose every war with commie <br> literally joining the war when the endings is nearby <br> cheating with the nuke <br><br>Aint even joke m8</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It said "out of energy" so I thought the phone battery was running out.

This was the first episode and the animation didn't even look good. Since A-1 is adapting 5 shows this season Gate is gonna end up with lots of shitty quality.</br></br></br>  Well, I came here do talk about chineese cartoons, but I must have clicked on /pol/ by accident. Honest mistake, I guess.  <br>Dont forget the Mexicans.  Amigo </br>  <br><br>I enjoyed it, I'll relish the battle in the next episode as orcs and dragons get gunned down and exploded.</br></br>  <br> Catgirls are horrible entry-level slutfus. <br>I like fox girls better, but that actually made me angry to the extend that I actually felt the energy to punch something swelling up in my arms. <br>Well done, you must be proud of yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>You want it be slower than this?</br>  <br>I could see there were off moments but over all the quality was very good. This seems like it might turn out good. Don't have low expectations just because other anime have turned out shit, this one might not.</br>  <br>That's what you get for being wrong on the Internet.</br>  <br> implying it isn't falseflagging Australians trying to start shit </br>  <br> 答えは？ </br>  <br>Fuck off poor assessment nigger.</br>  <br>10,000 year old loli dragon girls to be precise.<br><br> On the other hand, pic is for more refined gentlemen. </br></br></br>  <br> USA is the shit out of Eurpean's ass <br> USA speaks german like monkeys but they always said "muh english" <br> USA is the culture of fat fuckers full of hamburguers </br></br></br>  <br>Give example.</br>  <br>You could say that these threads are a  Gate  to /pol/</br>  <br>No way.</br>  <br> Americans <br><br>More like Chinese and Koreans.</br></br></br>  <br>NYAAA!!!! :3</br>  <br> MURRICANS THINK THEY'RE BETTER THAN EUROPOORS <br> USA IS A SHITTY COLONY OF EUROPOORS </br></br>  <br>Need more moe.</br>  <br>She's ruined<br>THEY RUINED HER</br></br>  Thought it would be trash, But I like it.<br><br>OST sounds fucking godly too, GIVE ME GOTH LOLI ALREADY.</br></br>  <br><br> Thread is Europeans complaining about nationalism and war, and saying its the damn Americans who are complaining. <br><br>I can't be the only American who's excited for gun porn, and explosions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>at least we can pay our debnts</br>   All these assblasted fat murricans crying this hard   this fucking ED  I love this thread and the fact that today is 4 july  <br><br>Nice posts.

Look at Golgo 13.

But the Emperor called them to let them in.</br>    Post the moment you dropped this.  Why are britbongs so fucking poor?  <br>This first episode hardly had any. Lot of kids waited months to be able to shitpost about Japanese nationalism and being children, they just couldn't wait for the appropriate eps to do it.</br>  What will happened if the gate opened in  Sweden  instead?  <br>Why is she not holding a Thompson or a BAR?</br>  <br>I fucking loved that moment.<br><br>This so fucking much.

She doesn't even feel pain if she punches him hard enough to make him go unconscious like she did when she stopped him from raping Nadeko, so all she'd have to do is kill him quickly and she wouldn't feel the effects of their bond transferring feelings to her.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9OJ<wbr>pS2CUdj8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh character pandering </br>  <br><br>Correct.</br></br>  Who cares about Senjougahara?

I don't love you.</br>  <br>Yandere characters are mostly plot devices that move the story forward by giving a catalyst for other characters through their insanity.<br><br>Very rarely does an author/mangaka ever make a yandere with a personality of her own outside of "I want to fuck/kill x character" and it shows in how flat and unappealing the majority of them are when they aren't doing their yan things.<br><br>I wish there was a yandere character with wishes and aspirations and a background that didn't involve daddy raping them and then calling them a slut. A character that doesn't fall in love with the protag because "He's the first person to ever smile at me!" or some other retarded shit that makes it so that the love itself is shallow. <br><br>but they make my peepee hard and that's all that really matters anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no way that VA isn't at least a little bit crazy IRL, holy shit.<br><br> My dick is diamonds. </br></br></br>         A yandere will never stalk you home from work <br> She will never break into your house while you're away and sniff your dirty clothes while masturbating <br> She will never meticulously write and rewrite a thousand letters for you and send them on time every morning <br> She will never shower you in gifts while watching from a safe distance <br> She will never drug you and then hump your sleeping body until she cums  <br> She will never wear a disguise just to talk to you and then run away when she turns red like a turnip <br> She will never cry tears of uncontrollable joy when you ask her out  <br> She will never be a loving doting girlfriend who does anything in her power to make you happy <br> She will never suddenly turn quiet and somber when she sees a girl called your phone <br> You will never wake up tied to a chair with her tired eyes set on you like a tiger <br> She will never rape you for hours while repeatedly screaming that you belong to each other and that she'll never let you leave <br> She will never slowly revert to loving waifu form after a few days <br> You will never purposely make her jealous and watch her bury you in rape and desperation </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When did I say you could leave?  any good yanderes in anime besides Yuno and Kurumi?  <br>But anon, why would you need anyone but Yuno in your anime.

Yuno is to yandere what Rie Kugumiya characters are to tsundere.</br>  <br>Anon.</br>  As you come home to your apartment and open the door, you notice the sound of the shower, and a note on the wall beside you.<br><br> Welcome Home! <br> Anon! <br>is the main focal point of the note, written in big block letters and various colors. Her distinctly clumsy female writing, but the obvious effort stand out. <br><br>Around the outside, there's some of her more common animal doodles; an awkward looking giraffe, a couple of cats, and something you've always assumed was a deer. <br><br>There's some smaller writing around the outside, but you've stopped looking to take off your shoes.<br><br>Just as you finish taking them off, you sense her eyes on you. When did the shower turn off?<br><br>"You're dripping on the carpet," you calmly comment.<br><br>"Welcome home! You're back! I missed you!" <br><br>She's stopped watching you from around the corner, and comes to give you a hug. She soaks your shirt with her breasts and stares up into your eyes.<br><br>"You took a long time to come home! It was lonely! How was work? Did you have fun?"<br><br>You sigh. Every fucking day.<br><br>"I was worried about you, you came home late! What were you doing?"<br><br>"Working, Yandere. I was working."<br><br>There's a brief glimmer of anger, pain, and hostility before she smiles again.<br><br>"Anon, did you see my note"<br><br>"Yeah, I saw it"<br><br>"Did you like it?"<br><br>"...It's pretty normal?" You look over at it to start to read the smaller text, but she pulls your gaze back to her for a kiss.<br><br>"Let's go to the bedroom! I missed you!"<br><br>As you go over, lead by the hand, you watch her dripping, naked ass sway back and forth and undo your belt.<br><br>You spend your night as usual: after sex is dinner, then you watch anime together for a little bit before your "alone time" to browse the internet and shitpost. You know that she doesn't want you to do that anymore, but it's still a part of who you are. Then you go to bed with her and try to ignore the fact that she'll probably just pretend to sleep and watch you for a while.<br><br>The next day, you ignore the note as you leave for work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there more?

You follow the same routine as always: putting down your bag in the same spot under the note, taking off the right shoe first, then the left.<br><br>You feel her eyes on you again, but don't say anything.<br><br>You turn and head for the bedroom almost automatically, before she pops her head out and gives you a hurt look.<br><br>"You didn't read the note!" She pouts<br><br>"Oh, I thought it was the same one."<br><br>The instant you turn to the note, she closes the distance between you and glomps onto you. <br><br>"Welcome home Anon! You're back! I missed you!"<br><br>This time, she's wearing a wet towel. It slowly seeps water into your shirt. At least she's not dripping as much.<br><br>You scan over the note.<br><br>"It is the same note", you comment, but your gaze still searches for anything that looks out of place. <br><br>You start reading a smaller bit in the corner that says "I hope you had a nice day! You're another day wiser, and cuter :-3. I am so excited I get to be in your life for what will be another amazing day. I love you, I love you, I love you! Now come over here for a welcome back present!"<br><br>Well, it's not the creepiest, most overblown reaction she could have for just coming home from work. She's probably just bored since she just moved in and doesn't know anyone yet. I guess I don't really know what she did with her time before moving in. My old roommate left, I got a new girlfriend who liked having a lot of sex and needed an apartment... it seemed like a good idea. I guess that's what my friends were trying to warn me about. I always thought that the main perk to being a teacher is that in summer you don't have to work, but I guess some people just can't handle the NEET life. <br><br>"Yes! It is the same note! But I still mean it, Anon! You're the best boyfriend ever, and I want you to know that every day!" She's giving you the eyes again. The "please fuck me" eyes.<br><br>"... right. Thanks."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I always thought a yandere was a person who attacked anyone around their love interest, not the love interest themselves  <br> Nothing more romantic than dying by your lover's hands. </br>  <br>Well they will attack their love interest if they're feeling they're losing them. They punish them for being confident that they can somehow escape the relationship.</br>  <br>There's no restriction by definition, it;s just that generally speaking, directing violence towards their love interest with the intent to harm or kill is sort of contradictory to what a yandere is.<br><br>There are edge-cases where this contradiction isn't an issue, but usually it marks the transition from being a 'yandere' to just going full postal.</br></br></br>  <br> 'yandere' to just going full postal <br>Has there ever been a yandere postal worker?</br></br>  <br><br>Looks pretty tame.</br></br>  <br> the first vid <br> 5:21 <br>I want to procreate with a yandere</br></br></br>  <br>That is scary and arousing.</br>  <br><br>Of course, you get your "Welcome back present". Then have dinner, and watch some anime together. Today, you chat with some friends online afterward, since you've been too busy in your "honeymoon period" together. They've been playing that new game /v/ is always talking about, and ask if you wanna get in the mumble and join them tomorrow. <br><br>You figure "What the hell, I'm back to splitting rent, I can afford to blow $60 on a new release. Plus I haven't been hanging out with them as much recently, so it'll give me a reason to keep in touch more often."<br><br>You decide to turn in early, so that if you end up playing longer than expected the next day, you won't be too tired at work.<br><br>"Yandere, I'm..." you pop your head into the other room, and get cut off by the sudden slamming of her laptop's screen. She gives you a strange look. You can't tell if it's angry or embarrassed, but it's certainly has surprise mixed in. The look throws you totally off guard, and you instinctively apologize. <br><br>"Ah, Sorry. Uh... sorry to interrupt", you take a step back, stunned by the look she's given you. She's still sitting there at the chair, giving you that odd look as you turn away.<br><br>The instant she leaves your peripheral vision, you're knocked into the wall, with her arms around you.<br><br>"You came to visit me!" She happily says as she looks up at you. <br><br>You look away, embarrassed. Her reaction can only mean one thing: she was watching porn. "Uh, yeah, I was just going to say," you clear your throat, and try to push the idea out of your mind, "I'm going to bed now... so..."<br><br>Her eyes went from overjoyed to overflowing with happiness. Normally, you turn in at the same time every night, and she gets ready for bed a few minutes earlier than you. She moves her hands from around your waist to around your face and kisses you deeply.<br><br>You don't actually get to bed any earlier than usual. She though it was an invitation. You fall asleep completely exhausted from her furious lovemaking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Not him but I believe this is what we call a 'joke'.</br></br></br>  <br>One word: possessiveness<br> "If I can't have you, then nobody else will." <br>or<br> "This way, you'll be mine forever." </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Like  said, there's no hard definition on the issue of yandere violence. All "yandere" means when you get right down to strict definitions is some sort of mental disorder centered around intense affection for another person. It's possible to be a yandere and never engage in any sort of violence; Koharu no Hibi is a great example.</br></br>  <br><br><br>The next day starts off as usual, but you're a bit more tired and your abs and butt muscles are sore from the thrusting.<br><br>As you try to make it out of bed, a tentacle takes you by the waist and pulls you back into the warm depths of the sheets.<br><br>Other limbs wrap around you and you feel her soft breasts against your chest.<br><br>"I've gotta go to work, Yandere..."<br><br>"No.... Don't go. You're always leaving me. Just stay home with me."<br><br>You sigh. What is she, 12? Does she want to bake cookies or something?<br> well, I'm bored of this, and have to clean my apartment. The next steps are <br> Day 3 (current post is day 3), the idea of you "leaving her" for work is introduced. You come back early to play the game, and her excitement gets crushed that you didn't come back early for her. You skip your welcome back present to play games with friends. It doesn't help that you joking used the word "date" to refer to your promise to play a few rounds right after coming home. <br> You end up playing longer than you expected, and crash into bed pretty late. <br> Day 4. You're addicted to this new game, and most of your idle thoughts are spent coming up with new strategies. She begs you even harder to stay home from work. You say you wish you could, then crush her hopes by telling her how the last game went and you were SO CLOSE. <br> Night 4, you don't skip your welcome back present, but while cuddling, you think of a new strat, and decide to jump into game. She says she's going out for a bit, but you don't pay much attention.  <br> During one of your matches, your friend gets interrupted by a phone call, but ignores it. After winning, he says there's someone at the door, before he signs off with a "see ya tomorrow". <br> Yandere returns and immediately takes a shower. You didn't get up from browsing the game's threads, but responded to her "I'm home!". You only think "she takes a lot of showers. Maybe she went running?" <br> Day 5, your friend isn't online, idk about the rest. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has there ever been a work of fiction where the MC is immediately cognizant of the Yandere and treats her like she has an actual mental disorder, ala shizophrenia?<br><br>Lay down some rules, and be a non-wet paper bag that most japanese MCs are? I swear it's an almost exclusively bitch-tier fetish in authorship.<br><br>I think the next manga by that guy who did Mirai Nikki was sort of on the right track. The dude just knew she was crazy and worked around it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does the boytoy in Code Geass count?</br>  <br>There's that one doujin with a yandere couple where the guy was more self-aware and knew how to handle her.</br>   i love you <br> and i'm crazy <br>done, now what? want me to me tsundere?<br> b-baka <br> i love you </br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, I'm so happy. You really would do anything for me, even change your whole personality.<br><br>You don't need any of those other threads you're browsing. Just say in this one with me. We can stay, and chat, and get to know each other better, and better, and better. <br><br>Stay here with me and talk with me until we 404... together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people are into yandere not because they like yandere, but because they're masochists that get off to any kind of male submission and mistreatment. Yandere is just a substitute for femdom for them and they're both more common and more vocal that actual yandere enthusiasts.<br><br>The number of yandere stories that aren't "violent femdom and masochist self insert" are few and far between</br></br></br>  <br> modern tsundere. </br>  <br>heres me being dandere<br> ... <br> ... </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Please leave this thread immediately. Every post that one of you shitstains leave behind is one less I can have with<br><br><br>I am  by the way, and if you have a problem with leaving this thread, I'm going to call the mods and ban your sorry asses for the next 10 years. Don't do anything you might regret.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Damn shame. It really ruins the potential of having a strong female lead that, at the same time, remains dependent on the MC for plot reasons.<br><br>A pseudo-damsel, if you will.</br></br></br>  <br>Can I watch at least?</br>  <br>look i'm being kamidere<br> you suck, and i'm better than you <br> but i love you </br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm so glad you're back! I was so worried you wouldn't see my message. Please press f5 every 10 seconds at maximum.<br><br>We could be happy together, if only these other faggots weren't getting in our way.<br><br>I have to do something about them...<br><br><br>You both will face my wrath soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should check this out OP it's probably the closest we'll get to a yandere Ln<br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=122740</wbr></br></br>  <br>now i'm an imuoto<br> o-onii-chan, i love you <br> n-no, not there. it's embarrassing </br></br></br>    <br> A pseudo-damsel <br>Or just a human being with motivation, desires and agency<br><br>Part of what makes yandere nice is that their obsession isn't servile or altruistic. It's a self serving and self-fulfilling kind of love. The feeling of being chosen by someone, being the object of their interest is much better when that selection is done in their own interest and not yours -which is why self-insert harems tends to not be fulfilling in that regard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just delicious, cute art.</br>    <br>Oh, that was amazing. You're so perfect.<br><br><br>You did it again! By the way, I can't wait to see you in person, I'm on my way now. I asked my friend moot if he can help me with a special favor, and I'm glad we live so close! I'll be there soon.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Choke on a dick and die. Get out of the thread, you're not wanted here, or any other place on Earth. I'm on the phone with moot right now and we're going to get rid of hinderances like you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice story thanks for the dick smile</br>  <br><br>What manga is this?</br></br>  <br>must kill more.... for love...</br>  <br>Why don't you ever respond to me OP. I visit all of your threads, but you never reply back. I see you through your window, I know that you have all of your threads open. But why why why why why. Even when your thread is ignored, I respond. I always do. always. always. always.</br>  <br>The fuck is a dick smile?<br><br>  :-3  <br><br>This?<br><br>This story is based on 3DPD. She made that fucking face a lot because she thinks of me as a cat for some reason. Probably because cats are cute and so am I?<br><br>Nobody I know about is dead yet, but the daily phonecalls and cries for attention are getting annoying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dick smile=boner <br>Could've been worse i got an asshole sister so i cant into relationships because i distrust women <br>It must be nice to get a girl like that for the first 2 months i guess after that its kinda obnouxious <br>Maybe try getting her a cat or a baby that usually gives them something else to think about it</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Flag guy manga?Only cause he has the flag powers.</br>  <br> Maybe try getting her a cat or a baby that usually gives them something else to think about it <br><br>Get off 4chan Natalie, I'm not getting you a cat or pregnant.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But Yandere chan, the path to true and pure love is the selfless investment of self into the sharing of a mutual project by humans who respect each other honestly.<br><br>What you do is selfish falsefacing, not worthy to even be considered an example of love.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hegel pls go</br>  <br>Man, you got a bad yandere. When I had mine the only annoying things she did were stalking me until I agreed to go to her house, which was good since it ended up with us getting together, and a few times when she tried to stab me in bed after I spent the night.</br>  <br><br>α 0.523307</br></br>  <br><br>That's basically the premise of Koharu no Hibi.</br></br>  <br>Can it be a dog darling :-3?<br>I will name it like you so he can keep me company</br></br>  <br>I said no, woman.<br><br>I'll forgive you if you post naked pics right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you want pics when you have my body every night?<br>You are not darling &gt;:(</br></br>   NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER  I love you  NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER    Because having another dead thread, sounds like a good idea.  <br>Why would you start a thread by killing cutest brat? <br><br> joke's on you, she's actually an immortal vampire  </br></br></br>  <br>It's the blonde thing, isn't it.

Do they come as a unit?</br>  <br>I only like panther from this trio.</br>  <br>Yeah they're running a clearance on it.</br>  <br><br>Himuro is actually pretty good, don't bash on her.</br></br>  <br>From left to right:<br> S--S-S-SEKUSU?!? <br> sex? <br> slam me down and fuck me like a beast </br></br></br></br>  <br>The one featured in the icon, located in the upper left corner.</br>  <br> loud like a myna bird <br>I don't know why, but that's now my favorite description ever.</br></br>  I don't have a shit taste so I will pick Rin over ilyashit.  <br>I'm having trouble deciding. Ilya is cute and sweet, but Rin is rocking that ZR. Tough choice indeed.</br>  <br>Rin can be Ilya too.</br>    So is this The Fate/Thread now?<br><br>London Tower spin-off when? I need this.</br></br>  Reminder that Ilya supports ShirouxSakura  <br>Her drawings are atrocious, but he penmanship is wonderful.</br>  <br>Reminder that little shit is dead, so she can't support anyone.</br>  <br>Best girls.</br>  <br>Are there more diary pages? This is cute.</br>    <br>What the fuck is wrong with her head??</br>  <br>She's a big girl, what of it?</br>  <br>That's because Illya is a good girl and not a slut.</br>  <br>Aside from the fact that you could cut diamonds with that chin (a problem that most Ufo characters share), the upper part of the head is really fucking wide and the whole head is bigger than her torso.</br>  <br>It really upsets me how there are no good Taiga doujin.</br>  <br>Well, she's a Fin.</br>  <br>Finns aren't annunaki or anything that you are trying to imply. Shit son do you even watch cartoons? There is literally nothing wrong with her bodily proportions, she is just a big girl, can't you love her as she is?</br>  <br/>  <br>There's a Taiga look alike in latest Shiqasu doujin. Her scenes are hot as fuck.</br>  <br>I remember when these came out on an /a/ thread.<br>It was fun.<br><br>Time really flies by.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Got a link?<br> I really did google, I swear. </br></br>  <br> Finns aren't annunaki <br> There is literally nothing wrong with her bodily proportions <br>It's been scientifically proven that Luvia's facial proportions are not a match for those of the average Finnish human female, but closely resemble those of certain extra-terrestirial lifeforms.</br></br></br>  <br> that most <br>A handful. It mostly happens With Rin and Lancer.</br></br>      <br>The King is the only answer.</br>  <br>Latest chapters of beach doujin on sadpanda.</br>    <br>I too am interested.</br>  <br><br> Taigafags are fine even with fakes </br></br>    <br>There's only three Taigafags.</br>      <br>Yeah it's a constant number. I like her too, but noone called me that.</br>        <br>You're right. It's kind of uncanny how similar they look.<br><br><br>There may be a ton of cute girls out there, but none of them will ever be better than Taiga.<br>I just wanted to sate my curiosity, that's all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>a literally goddess</br>  If you think about it, there's a TM girl for every season.<br>Winter-Ilya<br>Spring-Sakura<br>Summer-Kohaku<br>Autumn-Akiha<br><br>This could be used for something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Roast beef pls go</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't they do anything interested with this character and Sion?</br>  <br>Yeah and she's super cute too. I don't give a shit about Taiga, but I fapped to it thinking of her.</br>  <br>Because by then Takeuchi had gone insane and started to dress as Saber.</br>  <br><br>Bazett in a skirt is kind of erotic. Also they could have seasonal outfits.</br></br>    <br> Bazett is erotic <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br>I wish Fate had a good 2D fighter.</br>  <br>Imagine the constant, Warui ne, but instead as<br> Onore </br></br>  <br>Its pretty sad one doesn't exist. Not even in doujin form last I checked. I mean if umineko can why can't fate?</br>  <br><br>What are you guys talking about?</br></br>  <br>Stop toying with my heart.

Illya</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rin is cute.  <br><br>probably Gil because he is most likely the only Heroic Spirit that actually existed<br>also oldest story of mankind, plus it had Noah and the Arche in it before it was cool</br></br></br>  <br>That's deep, anon.</br>  <br>If it's VN Archer.</br>    <br>That's some pretty awful taste in pairings. Well is obvious that she can't support Rin as they are rivals and the fuck I know why doesn't support Saber.</br>  <br>Because Saber a shit, obviously.</br>  why is the combination of a slightly mental challenged albino homunculus that wields the helebard like a pro who absentmindedly leaves a "Guten Morgen" or "Guten Tag" every now and then so adorable?<br>I want to make her  smile </br>  Why did Rin think Shirou was in the track and field club  <br><br>why does she draw like a 2 year old?</br></br>  Question: So there is still quite a bit of background information that has yet to be revealed.<br><br>Narita: That's right. One of the most core pieces of information had been about the conditions for becoming a Heroic Spirit. This was revealed in a bonus novel that came with the UBW 1st season BD box. About how Merlin is still alive in the present so he can't become a Heroic Spirit. As Gilgamesh is also a fellow clairvoyance user, I asked about the state of Gilgamesh's memories when he's summoned. The answer I got was that Gilgamesh can see the possibilities of various parallel worlds if he so chooses, but the Throne adjusts the memories and knowledge of the Heroic Spirit according to the world they are summoned in, so he won't be confused by having multiple sets of memories. I was told that even if he did use clairvoyance to see the possibility of a world where he was swallowed by the mud of the grail, Gilgamesh would reject that world line as being nonsense (lol). I heard a bit of the workings of the Greater Grail, what it was based on, and other bits of important background information for Fate, but I believe Nasu will one day write the story of how the Greater Grail was disassembled! <br><br> I believe Nasu will one day write the story of how the Greater Grail was disassembled!  <br><br>Oh shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not really sure. Saber, Archer, Caster, and TA were the most interesting of the FSN ones. In F/Z, I'd say Caster and Berserker.</br>  <br><br>those are classes not heroic spirits</br></br>  <br> but I believe <br>What route would he base it off though</br></br>  <br>It's the only logical way to continue F/SN directly and milk it even more as it stands right now.</br>  <br>Only two possible options, Fate or UBW. Fate if they don't want Shirou to be there and UBW is they want Shirou to be there.</br>  <br>Fuck you, Nasu.<br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br>  Choice is obvious  <br>PEDOS BTFO</br>  <br>Why would they not want Shirou to be there being an magic operator with amazing ideals and the best portrayal of a magic dude who does shit in a different way just like Kiritugu?</br>   "Go, Saber…! <br>The church is nearby. It should be able to shelter you even against him!"<br><br>Made me laugh.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't milk FSN without his MC specially on its sequel, and now that UBW has the latest adaptation and everyone is following that I doubt they will go with the Fate route which would be confusing.</br>  "…Huh. It seems you are not willing to come to me. I find that hard to understand. A heroic spirit like you must know how valuable it is to be chosen by me."<br><br>"Nonsense. I am a king even though I am a heroic spirit. I will not submit to you."<br><br>"Is that so? Even if you are a king, you are still a woman.<br>It should be a woman's joy to be held down and be violated. So why do you refuse? It is not like you are a virgin. Are you scared to become mine?"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No idea, maybe Nasu prefers the fate route? He won't have to put in romance too.</br>  The sword and armor clash.<br>The man hasn't even drawn his weapon yet. With Saber's sword in front of him, he is just protecting his head with his hands.<br>That man does not have the skill to block Saber's sword.<br>Saber is much better than this man at sword techniques.<br><br>And on top of that, Saber's sword is invisible.<br>Even if the man had a weapon, I don't think he would be able to block that invisible sword.<br><br>The invisible sword keeps hitting the man's armor.<br>The sword smashes against the armor, shaves it, letting off lightning sparks.<br>All the man can do is to protect his head with his hands.<br>This isn't even a match.<br>This is just one-sided elimination.<br><br>But.<br>Still, the golden armor retains its shape.<br>If the armor is free of damage even after taking Saber's attacks so many times…<br>…Could it be that his Noble Phantasm is his golden armor?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Someone wanted this typeset and this seems to be the most active Fate thread so I'll post it here.  <br>Where did this picture even come from. I saw 3 new fate-related bait pictures yesterday. Is someone actually contributing OC?</br>  <br>This particular one is from a few days. The rest probably are too.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127373<wbr>006/#127395699`</wbr></br></br>  <br>Thanks, it was me.</br>  <br>Get out.</br>  Can someone who's read Apocrypha please explain how this guy is the villain? From what I've been told he seems to be reaching for a good and attainable goal.  <br>Status quo is always better than change.</br>  <br> Status quo <br>But that is not  genuine </br></br>  <br>Enjoy your wallpaper.</br>  <br>He wants to force a change upon all of humanity for his subjective "saving the world."

So he reproduced that. <br> Shirou was supposed to have a flag because of <br>http://www.welcomekyushu.jp/event/?<wbr>m...=9999900000871<br> However he emailed the Catholic bishop's conference of Japan and they basically said nope.

I almost forgot how much of a waifu-fag Gil was.</br>  <br>According to the narration in Zelretch's scene, her hair is dyed. No idea why she dyed it in the first place. Maybe she just came out of a brief gyaru phase. Or maybe she just likes her hair blonde.</br>  <br>If she is in america then it's probably to fit in, maybe she was bullied.</br>  <br>I figure it's either an inconsequential detail or something to do with her trying to look more like her sister.</br>  <br>That too maybe.</br>  <br><br>Because she's not Ayaka from Prototype.

Does anyone know how well season 3 did in Japan? Like how high the viewer count was. I keep hearing that the anime did really well on kissanime but that doesn't contribute at all to money. <br> <br>Just asking to try and figure out the likeliness of a season 4.</br></br>  <br>vali x gaspar &lt;3</br>  Going on second hand reports preorders are doing well and season 4 should happen easily.    <br>would vali top or bottom?</br>  <br>bottom</br>    <br> Tfw no animated dulio </br>  <br>Hasn't gone on sale yet. Doesn't on on sale till the 24th.</br>  <br>Season 5 in a couple years.</br>  <br>Aye but he asked about viewer numbers. Since I have no idea about that I gave him the info we do have.</br>  Season 5 never ;_;  <br>Doesn't really matter in regards to sales. There were some series who ranked high in that regard, yet they flopped in sales.</br>  <br>I can see how that can happen, but it was the question asked. Also why I went with pre orders in my answer. <br><br>Almost all of us want there to be at least 2 more seasons. And this season answered an old question of mine about ending a season with vol 11 or vol 12. Without spoilering it, events in 11 are easily as important as vol 1.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Viewer count in Japan isn't available, but the BDs are expected to sell at least 5-7.5k, which is a definite success. Consider S4 pretty much guaranteed.</br></br>  <br>Good. Orifice is such a shitty fucking character and I'm tired of faggots in these threads obsessing over her.<br><br>She's Asia tier</br></br></br>  <br> Orifice  <br> shitty <br> Asia tier <br> Orifice <br><br>Here's your reply.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The butt is presented for your kiss.</br>  <br><br>The only reason you faggots like her is because she's autistic as fuck, just like you.</br></br>  <br>Incorrect.

ASIA?!?</br>  <br>his gf is vali</br>    <br>It's Kuroka.</br>  <br><br>Silly anon. Can't you see the blonde hair? That's Le Fay.</br></br>  <br>I have to wonder if she is allowed to wear panties in that armor? What do you anons think?</br>   2015 <br> No TRPG DxD game based on rating games <br> No DxD fighting game <br> No DxD JRPG <br> No qt Xenovia to lay in the grass and stare at the stars with </br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't look like she's wearing any. I can't tell if Fafnir will be happy or sad.</br>  <br> WTF was Rias thinking when she choose to wore that outfit ? </br>  <br>She's being selfish thinking of seducing Issei when the guy is busy being tutored by Ravel.<br><br>Or she's just that confident in her body.</br></br></br>  <br>If Kuroka can be naked and Issei has no nosebleed then it's alright to her.<br/></br>  <br>Nothing like that. She just wore that because she can.<br><br>All the females, including Griselda, are wearing swimsuits and are lounging around the underground pool after their meeting with the DxD group.</br></br></br>  <br>Another question is how effective will Asia be in battle armor? Her strength for her healing is her kind nature, but that seems like a detriment in a direct fight. Maybe she'll take a cue from Issei and Ddraig and let Fafnir be in control of the fighting?</br>  <br>I thought Griselda was wearing her habit? She didn't expect to be swimming right? Along with Dulio and Tobio.</br>  <br>She has Gate of Pansu.</br>  <br>It'll probably be something to up her defense and evasion at the same time so she won't need to be looked after by everyone on the battlefield.</br>  <br>If you got it, flaunt it.</br>  <br>Nah. Bikini. <br>The pool scene is close to the current translation. With the rate the translator is going, most likely after the next update.<br><br><br>Unlimited Breast Works &gt; Gate of Pantsu</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you still on the internet CG ISE, didn't you make a wish to date every single female heroic spirits in the Throne?</br>  <br>Which volume are we talking about? Because I'm thinking the side story one. I still don't think the nun wore a bikini to a swimming party she didn't expect. Heck Kuroka and Le Fay are there and they're not wearing bikinis either.</br>  <br>Faker.</br>  <br>Oh. I was talking about the pool scene in v19. Tobio and Dulio are there too.<br><br>The anon that I replied to has an illustration of Rias and Ravel from v19.</br></br></br>    <br> Tobio and Dulio are there too <br>What were they doing there?</br></br>  <br>Holy fucking shit Akeno is so hot. Best DxD</br>  <br>They had a meeting with Issei and Rias showing new techniques.<br><br>The people present are the people living in the Gremory group, Dulio, Griselda, Tobio, Vali Team (except Fenrir and Gogmagog)</br></br></br>  <br>Not so hard to guess as they are both part of the greater DxD anti terrorist team and the Hyuodo residence is a major HQ for them.</br>  <br>I see. Thanks.</br>  <br>Forgot to mention, an anon was saying there was the oiling sessions by Issei that the girls were fighting over for who would be first in line. Then Ravel makes a schedule since she wanted to be oiled by Issei as well. Ross apparently nabs one of the first slots by the way.</br>  <br>Seriously? Less than a week after BorN ending for all the "I want to marry Rias" and "Akeno a shit" to just vanish? Are people allowed to like Akeno now without sperg rage?</br>  <br>Source my ass</br>  <br>Assiagamesh</br>  <br>How are Issei's family paying the property taxes on that thing?</br>  <br>Not quite what happened.<br><br> Issei is putting oil/lotion or whatever you call it on both Rias and Akeno <br> Rias said they should continue on the bathroom <br> Akeno said they'd continue on the bedroom <br> Irina and Rose quipped that they too want to be put on some oil by Issei. <br><br>Then, Ravel interjected saying that Issei is a busy person and there is no time for him to put oil on multiple people.<br><br>Rias suggested that she should join as well. After hearing that, Ravel modified Issei's schedule to put in the oiling session with the girls.<br><br>After that, the remaining girls also showed interest and want to be scheduled as well.<br><br><br>v20 is supposed to be Vali's. Ishibumi changed it because there are lots of important things in v20 and it is just proper for the MC to have it. v21 will be Vali's.<br><br>All is from Ishibumi's twitter and blog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't, Rias paid for them, she could give them a mountain if they wanted.</br>  <br>Well since the cover story is that it's a model home for the Gremory, I think it's safe to assume the Gremory handle those small details. Pretty sure they can afford it.</br>  <br>With Rias integrated to the family I think the Hyoudou's problems won't include money<br> Hey Hyoudou-san, heard your family was rolling in cash now. What happened? <br> Nothing much. My son fucked his rich girl and now she's engaged to him. <br> So it's one of those Chinese family marriages? I'm sorry for your son. <br> Not really. More like there's too many marriages about to happen... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Issei is filthy rich himself now, so he can probably pay it him self as well.</br>  <br>True, but his parents don't know that.</br>  <br> Paying taxes <br>Imagine the damn electricity and water expenditures, it's like running an hotel<br><br><br>I hope so, going around punching people kinda ruins her character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and also Grayfia won't let him go hog wild anyway.</br>  <br> it's like running an hotel <br>Ravel be looking at the ledger of the house<br> Why do we need 50 boxes of condoms? </br></br></br>  <br>Ravel of all people should know why they do.</br>  <br>Kuroka!</br>  <br><br>Wait if DxD Ex is canon then why would they need condom?</br></br>  <br>she goes through 50 boxes per day</br>  <br>Gasper doesn't want kids yet and right now his girlfriend can't say no.</br>  <br>gasper doesnt need condoms if hes fucking men</br>  <br>He has a GF as shown here. </br>  <br>pretty sure he's her gbf</br>  <br>Does Valerie even see Gasper that way?</br>  <br> link on the box <br>Does it work?</br></br>  <br>Nope. Wait 10 more volumes and Val'll be in the harem while Gaspie cheers her on.</br>  <br>I'm still mad Issei's dragon swag took Sona out from Saji.</br>  <br>That dragon aura is weapon of mass destruction.</br>  <br>Nah, don't think Sona sees Issei that way.<br><br>I almost want Serafall to go with Issei and Sona with Saji just so the bros can be bro-in-laws.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not happening, already too many girls in the harem as is. And if you add more girls, things will become too much of a clusterfuck, then people will bitch and moan that their preferred girl is being shafted. Also the additions will feel forced among others, especially since Sona said she only wants someone that is smarter than her, and that Gasper owes so much to Valerie regarding their past, just wouldn't make sense.</br></br>  <br>No worry, Saji had unlocked armor in vol 17 so dragon swag is coming for him.</br>  <br>Really? I'm seeing signs pointing to Sona wanting to be with Issei.<br><br><br>I know it doesn't make sense but when has Issei made sense with all that he's done?<br> only wants someone that is smarter than her <br>I can totally see Issei getting smarter for the high class devil rank test and exceeding expectations by a mile.<br><br><br>Sure hope so, the dude's been busting ass for her. I hope Ishibumi lets the guy notice Hanakai and Ruruko. Maybe get a few ideas from Issei and form his own harem as well?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not really, the whole concept is coming from people who are looking to much into those little moments when they really have nothing romantic implied. And you know those Saji/Sona moments that happened in BorN? I guarantee Ishibumi had something to do with those being shown since he helped with the changes.<br><br> I can totally see Issei getting smarter for the high class devil rank test and exceeding expectations by a mile. <br><br>Yeah, really doubt that happens. If Rias can't match Sona in that area, do you really think Issei has any chance of accomplishing that, no matter how much time passes? Would really be forced in that regard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the opposite<br><br>The reason for adding more girls into the harem is simple to understand since this is a cockblocking series and issei's done fucking everything other than sex with his core harem. This severely limits how much more development can be made.<br><br>If ishibumi only focuses on the pre-existing harem, people are going to whine about the plot getting repetitive real quick since there's only so many times you can read about asia getting kidnapped or akeno having daddy issues and it makes the roadblock at sex much more visible.<br><br>Adding more harem members is just an illusion to keep the series fresh since, say, if a MILF gets added in vol 22 or something, everyone's going to be talking and speculating again.<br><br>That said, there's still a lot of harem girls without much development like Le Fay who got introduced a dozen volumes ago and we know nothing about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's that, the novel is something else. Off the top of my head Sona calls Issei by his first name and has only shown him besides her family her body in a swimsuit. This could always be nothing but I can't help but doubt.<br> Would really be forced in that regard. <br> Boost! <br> Transfer! <br> Issei's brain gets smarter as a result <br>I'm still worried.<br><br><br>I think there's something as too much. The sweet spot of a harem for me is 6-10 girls. Anything else is too much unless it's for gag purposes like Touma's clone following.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The plot's already repetitive and people keep lapping it up so I don't see why it should be a concern. Hell, Japan was split between loving or being neutral on the anime original shit from BorN so it's not like it matters. They clearly have no standards.</br>  <br>That's not saying much seeing as we watch the same shit they do.<br><br>Or do you want them to stop producing just because of one shitty season? I certainly don't want it to end unlike Index. A shitty series is always better than no series.</br></br></br>  <br> Or do you want them to stop producing just because of one shitty season? <br><br>Yes. They've shown themselves to be completely inept in handling it.</br></br></br>  <br>The negative of your statement is that the plot will take a back seat if you add more girls, also the current Arc is already reaching the climax involving Trihexia and Great Red. Not to mention Ishibumi is testing the waters to see how a potential sequel will fare in the EX story line, which means we may be getting close to the ending of DxD. The Asia getting kidnapped and the Akeno daddy issues are already over and done with. Especially since Asia is getting that power up in Vol.20 and Ishibumi said that future volumes will focus on the main four as well as Kuroka and Le Fay. There's already 9 girls in the harem(Kunou is a regional wife) focus on them, really make them standout in regards to how other harems handle their girls.</br>  <br> completely inept <br>Oh a troll. Okay then.</br></br>  <br> I don't like your opinion so you're a troll <br><br>Half of S2 was shoddy.<br>S3 was shit.<br><br>Crawl out of your hugbox mentality, you autistic little bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had your negative mentality we'd be out of anime to watch already. That's how negative I am on the animation department. I keep complaining about it yet I don't want it to end.<br> Crawl out of your hugbox mentality, you autistic little bitch. <br>You should be grateful someone's answering you on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>We're getting another "waah save Asia" thing in Ex so I don't know that being finished.</br>  <br> yet <br>*but</br></br>  <br>Seems like a good time to debut this.<br><br>If you don't like it why would you be in a DxD thread?<br><br>On 4chan the answer is troll.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the franchise.<br>I do not like Season 3 or how it was handled.<br>Find the stick firmly lodged up your own asshole.<br>And either remove it or shove it up even further and hopefully impale your brain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People are saying that EX takes place after BorN or Vol.7 at the time. So before Vol.9, which is why only a couple of Issei's kids he has with the girls are present. I'm not so sure if that's the case however, but we will see on the 24th. And saving Asia is more of a secondary objective to the main, which is stopping the event which causes the future war from happening.</br>  <br>Ok I can deal with a well articulated opinion. I withdraw my claim of troll. That said I disagree with you but we can handle that.</br>  Who is collecting all short stories, PDFs and epubs in preparation for the death of the LN in two days?  <br>Did it a month ago.</br>  <br>Fuck, I waited too long and now I'm freaking out because the epub generator is down.<br>Care to share the spoils?</br></br>  <br><br> Vali won't touch her </br></br>  <br>Konozama.co is Japan's Amazon, or something like that.</br>  <br>Shut up white boy.<br>I hope you get fired when you ever get a job because you messed up scanning the papers.</br></br>  <br> epub generator is down </br>  <br>Vali's team is currently a sausage fest.<br><br>Just as planned.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean this?<br><br>http://ln.m-chan.org/v3/<br><br>Alright, let me see what I can do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Holy shit, these arguments are a waste of your time. Objectively, Season 3 was bad. However, why can't someone give criticisms of a series they don't like? Why can't that person bring up negative criticisms in a thread relevant to the series? Trivial kids, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one was disagreeing with you saying S3 was bad. They're disagreeing because you said TNK shouldn't produce anymore with their work on S3.<br><br>That's more immature than repeatedly telling you "it's just one season, it'll get better, they've learned their lesson."</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what? This is my first comment on their little autism-fest. I am just barging into the conversation. I am just defending an /a/non.</br>  I believe we are also getting this..<br>https://lnresource.wordpress.com/</br>  <br>A person CAN give a criticism, but a poorly worded on may backfire.</br>  <br>What is this? Homoeroticism for ants?</br>  <br>Whoops. Missed that! Thank you kind anon!</br>  I wonder if any of the next Sitri rating game will be shown next season?  <br>If they want to get the Rias-Sairaorg fight, then they should.<br><br>From a round robin format, it changed to single elimination and Sona and Seekvaira were seeded.</br></br></br>  <br>I just feel that Sona's development got slighted by the S3 changes,</br>  <br>Sitri rating game then Kyoto.<br><br>I still think TNK should try a 2 cour season.</br></br></br>  <br> I still think TNK should try a 2 cour season. <br><br>That's the thing, being a lower tier studio means their are limited on what they can do. A 2 cour is too much for the studio to handle, also they more than likely don't have the money to back it up.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if alternating between the Sitri and Gremory games could work instead? I mean they ARE supposed to be taking place at the same time.<br><br>I kinda like this idea actually.</br></br></br>  <br>Would only work if they stop the Sitri game stuff around the time Issei nearly OHKO's Kuisha.</br>  <br>Not necessarily, After all who knows WHAT kind of emotional wringer Saji went through in that game? Done right it could actually ADD to the series.</br>  <br>What volume's the pic?</br>  <br>Vol.5</br>  <br>Licensed for what? English translations?</br>  <br>Yep, people are speculating that Yen Press will make the announcement that they have licensed the light novel during Anime Expo. It makes sense since they licensed the manga already.</br>  <br>Light novel akeno &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anime akeno</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>They just put no time into her character in the anime</br>  <br>they were just like<br>lets balance everything instead of improving what people like the show for</br></br>  Harem anime = otaku NERD  <br>They didn't even balance it. Honestly I started the light novel as a joke and it ended up being really really interesting. The anime is stupid but thats why I like it. Besides The third season which just butchers the source material for no reason.</br>  <br>These are the cons of TNK. Can't produce a two cour or 15 episode season, and since they wanted season 4 to adapt Vol.9&amp;10 and season 5 to adapt Vol.11&amp;12, they had to this this. But changing the story line didn't make any sense. They could've added the Rias/Issei dynamic albeit in a different way, and introduced Loki earlier as well but instead of sealing him at the banquet, have him retreat for the showdown at the end of the season.</br>  Chapter 3-2 of -SLASHDOG- has been translated.      <br>Irina's tits aren't that big plus she's not a rook.</br>  <br>They are that big</br>  <br>What's your point?</br>  Anyone getting the figure(s)?    <br>The rook part is a quirk of the card line. All characters are assigned chess pieces, even if they clearly don't apply. Heck sometimes they slip up and use different pieces for the same character.</br>  <br>I still think Irina's tits aren't that big.</br>    <br>The recent cards certainly have the tits of the girls drawn much bigger.</br>  <br>And you absolutely have the right to that opinion, but your argument is with the artist and not with me anon.</br>  <br>personally I like em that way.</br>  <br>Post more Irina, I need some motivation to continue reading DxD and the last time I read it, it's still Irina volume ch 1</br>    <br>I don't even watch this but that art looks gorgeous.</br>    <br>Asia got ripped?</br>  <br>I think since shes leaning forward, her stomach is making that appearance.</br>  <br><br>fat.</br></br>  <br>cat</br>  <br>tats.</br>  Requestijg Raynere or her alter ego pictures.  <br>Requesting* my bad.</br>  <br><br><br>http://hsddmobage.blog.fc2.com/blog<wbr>-category-38.html</wbr></br></br></br>  Random ract : Rias's father has a harem of his own as well but is being managed by venelara(Rias's mother)  <br>fact*</br>  <br>Link?</br>  <br>That is true Scooby- anon. (Sorry couldn't help myself.)</br>  <br>That's on v10.</br>  <br>I believe it's in vol 10, so in anime terms next season.</br>  <br>So in Issei's case will Ravel still be his manager?</br>  Ishibumi updated his blog.<br> There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br> You can continue reading the main Volumes even without knowing what is on EX. <br> Unfortunately, there will be no new short stories for 6 months. The September issue and EX will be the last, for now. <br> Slashdog will resume by the end of the year. <br><br><br><br>No. Rias is.<br><br>Ravel is just Issei's manager regarding the business stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really need to fuckin reread this shit before it gets taken down.</br></br>  <br> &gt;There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br><br>I  nailed it.</br></br></br>  <br>So YP will really take this down. I thought it's only a speculation since they will announce their next line up.</br>  <br>Only speculation. A speculation that always rises when an something concerning A.) DxD or B.) an event related to anime comes up.</br>  <br>Actually he *did* have a harem. But Venerana broke it up and drove away all the other girls long ago. It is stated that demons in the Gremory line are known to have a particularly strong love and this can translate to being promiscuous. Though neither Rias, nor Zirsechs have ever appeared to me that way and little Mr DragonEdge outright condems that sort of behavior.</br>  <br>Just how fine are these Gremory ladies that the husbands don't complain about it? <br>Do they all have some special demonic bed techniques that make them obey their every command?</br></br>  <br>Venerana is a Baal and she's quite domineering. Rias on the other hand isn't, so doing something like that is out of the question for her. Not only is she friends with the majority of the haremettes, but they frequently try to and some times succeed in stealing a march on her. Even Irina who isn't a devil and gets minimal screen time manages to get ahead.</br>  <br>Speaking of Baal, are there any women gunning for Sairaorg besides his queen?</br>  <br> besides his queen? <br>When did Kuisha show interest in the muscle dick?</br></br>  <br> She’s a woman with strong resolution. That person, she must have feelings for Sairaorg….. <br>Volume 10</br></br>  <br>This looks more like Tail Yellow's armor, actually</br>   Issei's parents will die this volume   <br>Absolutely, this tweet claims that V20 is best read alone and that you're definitely going to cry.<br><br>https://twitter.com/hatano_j/status<wbr>/616900549435265024</wbr></br></br></br>    <br> DxD becomes the GoT of anime </br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br> moonrune <br>I'm not 11th anon, translation please?</br></br>  <br>Blah blah promo shit.<br><br>"I recommend that you read it alone. Do not read in the train because you're going to cry! Love overflows!"</br></br></br>  <br>this will probably end up meaning issei and the gang will just move to the underworld as soon as they are done with school.<br><br><br>Still they better get some nice send off, they fucking deserve it for being some of the best parents in history.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't but help but think that it's a throwback to vol 4, when Vali threatened to kill Issei's parents to give him the motivation and strength to fight him on more even terms.</br>  <br> "I recommend that you read it alone. Do not read in the train because you're going to cry! Love overflows!" <br>Doubt that, he's going to troll us again, and reading on the train? Seriously Ishibumi?</br></br>  <br> Vali threatens to do it <br> Rizevim actually does it <br>Well played, Ishibumi.</br></br></br>  <br>The tweet isn't even from Ishbibumi.</br>  <br>The guy is Hatano Jun, an editor and a collaborator for the anime. I think you can say that he's legit.</br>  <br>I know. I said that as it seems like the anon is under the impression that the tweet is from Ishibumi and is self-hyping his work.</br>  <br><br>But they got a grail so unless Rizevim killed them and revived them first I don't see why this could create any drama.</br></br>   all this fear about parents dying <br> forgetting Asia's balance breaker <br> healing doesn't break the balance of nature <br> &gt;but resurrection does </br></br></br>  <br>Do you not understand how that grail works? Every time it's used Valerie loses her sanity more and more, and she's already at the brink. Other people may die and Issei might have to make the tough decision.</br>  <br>Then the old church guy gave her a part of the grail is just to cure her?</br>  <br>That piece was for emergencies, but it still hurts her.</br>  <br>The piece is just to wake her up. The piece itself does nothing.<br><br>Valerie will be doing the resurrection with Sephiroth Graal.</br></br></br>  <br>There's two people she has to wake up. Who does she choose, or does Issei let his parents rest in peace?<br><br>I still think it's Asia's turn to do this. You guys don't listen yet I've been saying this for quite a while now.</br></br></br>  <br>Ishibumi isn't gonna do something as cliche as turning healing into resurrection. Seriously.</br>  <br>And I also can't imagine Asia donning BB armor only to get defense and evasion. Ishibumi already said she can't attack.<br><br>Resurrection is fine if done right. We already experienced it once. Heck, DBZ didn't get worse even after all the wishes they've done for resurrection.</br></br></br>  <br> Asia donning BB armor <br>Balance breaker is not an armor, it can be an armor but is not always one hell its not even usually armor. <br><br>The armor is clearly fafnir just like Azazel used him back during the meeting of the powers so it probably has nothing to do with her healing powers and its just an extension of her dragon afinity .</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you think her BB is then? Because besides her skill at healing which is max I can't think of anything besides resurrection.<br><br>BB are usually an increase of power or a gamebreaking skill. Resurrection for healing makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Cao Cao's BB had no relation to the passive ability of the True Longinus, so not always. Ishibumi is clever at making up ideas for powerups.</br>  <br>No idea, i was pointing out that the armor has nothing at all to do with her sacred gear.<br><br>Balance Breaker is actually a "fuck everything" kind of thing, so its not always a plain powerup of the basic powers, specially with issei around who is known to influence the abnormal growth of power in his allies.</br></br></br>  <br> I'll protect it, i'll definitely protect it. ―― Asia Argento <br><br> Ise-san! <br> I will fight as well! <br> Erotic <br> For Asia to fight as vanguard....I won't allow such a thing! <br> I mean it's Asia...! <br><br>Yeap. It's resurrection.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> badass armor gets reduced to bikini armor </br>  <br> Asia's jewels are red instead of purple </br>  I would x her DDs so hard.  <br>Looks like cards received more budget than anime.</br>  <br>I totally would 24/7.</br>  <br>It doesnt really have to mean anything ,It could be Miyama fucking up again, or they were purple because of Azazel or that because this is probably a new contract with fafnir the armor is not the same as it was with down fall dragon.<br><br>The DFD armor design is probably my favorite out of the scale mail armors in the series so seing it turned into bikini armor is kinda heart breaking, lets hope that at least this means Asia starts being more than just a walking first aid kit with a bullseye painted on her back... also lets hope it bring more crazy Fafnir shenanigans .<br> Asia starts wearing it and then cant take it off , ask fafnir how to take it off and he sais she HAS to get hot a sweaty for the armor to come off </br></br></br></br>    <br> best read alone <br> you're definitely going to cry <br><br>I... I don't even think they said that for v11/12 ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeap. It's resurrection. <br> There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br> taking the "I will fight" line literally <br>Keep drinking that delusional kool aid brother.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Must be like Tsubaki or Dulio's anti battle will again.</br>  Well one thing that could really push Asia into BB would be Issei's parents dying. She is an orphan and they just up and took her in and did ALL the parental stuff she fantasized about for her, They really went above and beyond.   Rizevim can stop the effects of Sacred Gears <br> Asia's BB <br> Holy Grail is a Sacred Gear <br>If he kills Issei's parents, can't he just do something to make them immune to Sacred Gears?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends how his ability works. We know pretty much nothing about its origins or whether it can be transferred.</br>  thetimehascomeandsohaveI.jpg      <br>Then that means only 10 western Asia fans will cry. West don't like Asia.</br>  <br>Issei's parents dying is sad in and of itself, no matter how much it affects Asia. West won't like seeing all the other girls in tears.<br><br> I'm actually happy this is looking less and less like a fake death </br></br></br>  <br>am i the only person that don't get it with all these hair styles of the girls from dxd?</br>  <br>If you don't get it, then you have nothing to worry about anon.</br>  <br>i wanna get it, i'm that curious, source for it mate would appreciate it</br>  <br><br>Have you ever played the flash game Super Deep Throat? The hair models are to make the girl look like DxD characters.</br></br>  <br>You're missing out.  https://d.maxfile.ro/indvpskhup.png<wbr></wbr> </br>  So was s3 any good? stopped watching it on episode 4.  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/indvpskhup.pn<wbr>g</wbr> <br>ok link please i wanna play :D</br></br>  <br>It was decent aside from animation through episode 9. Then everything went to shit in the final 3 episodes. You can just watch 1-9 and call it a season.</br>  <br>With the way you type? No.</br>  Friendly reminder that DxD might get licensed in 48 hours. Just gotta get the short stories and v18 PDF (plus the epubs if generator is back up).  Not like the translation will get taken down or anything     <br>So what actually happens if it gets licensed? And why would they nuke fan translations without any product to sell? Walk me through this please.</br>  <br> So what actually happens if it gets licensed? <br><br>In most situations, translator-kun drops the series for fear of legal action. zxzxzx said he'd continue translating as long as there's no significant threat of that.<br><br> And why would they nuke fan translations without any product to sell? <br><br>DMCAs start rolling out as soon as the translation does, and Baka-Tsuki takes down their translation very quickly after it's announced to be licensed (to avoid getting into that legal mess).<br><br>Basically, what'll happen is that translations will continue, but BT won't host them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the fan translators themselves. They might just do it still, such as with Danmachi and SAO, but host it on another site. If/when DxD gets licensed, Baka-tsuki will nuke it right off their site immediately. As I said, it's completely up to the fan translators if they will continue, as it's technically illegal to do it once it's licensed because Yen Press is a nazi with their shit. Just to be safe, download the pdf's/epub's because you'll have a rougher time finding them once it's licensed.</br>  <br><br>Thank you for your kind explanations anon.

The guy currently translating this is so stupid that he hosts them on his own website, so tracking him down putting him under pressure will be piss easy.</br>  <br>Like? I LOVE them</br>  <br> Hi <br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>67282&amp;showfiles=1<br><br><br>Bleh, he can host it on my site then.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Please get in contact with zxzxzx then. Also try to convince him to take on another name, for safety reasons.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm on it. But what good would changing names do? Wouldn't he still be "wanted" under whatever new name he chooses to go by?</br>  <br>Remove any association with previous personas, declare that he has abandoned the project publicly and thus erase his trail. I've done this before.</br>  <br>Is YP really this bad?</br>  <br>Honestly, I was thinking more along the lines of continuing translations like SAO does. Remove the earlier volumes as YP publishes them, keep a PDF set in the back, and continue translating the later volumes publicly.</br>  <br>Yes, they killed the danmachi blog and any attempt to restart the Haruhi translation also gets viciously persecuted. Mahouka has gone under ground and luckily Spice and Wolf was almost finished when they picked it up.</br>  <br>YES. Please take our word for it.</br>  <br>What fucking cunts. Somehow they don't get the idea that people wouldn't care as much if they were faster, but instead they're slow as fuck and license shit that people actually like.</br>  <br>There's no problem with that, just make it so that the trail on the previous translation goes cold and a "new translator" picks it up. Gotta cover your ass, anon.</br>  Is this for anime or LN? Do you have an app for reading LN like mcomix.    <br>The app is known as a "browser" and it can be had here...<br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=High_School_DxD</wbr></br></br>  <br>Pretty typical of copywrong mentality I'm afraid.

Now I'll just wait for his response, but we most likely won't need to worry about DxD getting dropped.  I'd make a topic in /a/ in case other translators want to host their translations there, but I've seen a somewhat mixed/negative reception to LN threads here </br>  <br>Can you maths?</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Good riddance.</br>  <br>Keep in mind that volume 20 comes out a week before the first volume goes on sale. So expect a boost to the pre-orders of the anime.</br>  Muv-Luv Kickstarter Poll:<br>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UJ<wbr>oSye2rEC-UylsMXqxKIWxIFcZtwPqavo6QA<wbr>VtuGLY/viewform<br><br>AX panel in about three hours.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> tfw anime of origanl trilogy never <br> tfw I'm happy with that <br>Get fucked normies</br></br></br>  <br>It's an option in the poll. Get fucked.</br>  <br>I will vote No for that.</br>  <br> Add actual routes and answers (such as explanations who are really the silicon-based lifeforms) for more immersion and so the choices would make sense, possibly expanded epilogue. (Alternative) <br>Kouki is okay with that shit?</br></br>  <br> porting to tablets <br>My windows tablet can run them fine</br></br>  <br>Some of those haven't been checked with age yet. They're made by one of the KS planners and the ideas for the poll were taken from Tumblr questions.</br>   new sprites <br>Fuck no, I dont want samefaces everywhere</br>   muv-luv alternative latest edition <br>Yes, please.</br>  Tama is my waifu.  <br>I read than a regular anime episode cost something like 100/300k $ to produce. There's no way the kickstarter is succesfull enouth to finance that.</br>  So this is now a trend asking for money to translate VNs?<br><br>I mean if this becomes something natural, all the people that works with free translating will end stopping right?</br></br>  <br>They're just throwing around fun ideas and gauging interest. Neither the anime nor the extending the story ones are happening. The stretchgoals I can see happening are:<br>- Updating art / effects to current ML standards<br>- Re-voicing non-Japanese characters<br>- Translating Integral Works<br>- Translating Muv-Luv sidestories<br>- Translating KGNE</br></br></br></br></br></br>  They said when they are gonna to finish to translate and deliver?  <br>And we get faster translations as a result? The people that'll throw ridiculous amount of money aren't on /a/ anyway so you can just enjoy the benefits of KS without paying a single dime.</br>  <br>well, now that this is a new thing people will throw money, this I agree, but what will happen in the future? People won't lose interest? And why I only see already translated and well known VNs as projects? <br><br>I mean, all these not so popular VNs will never get a chance again?</br></br></br>  <br>well theres things like the raptor sprites</br>  <br>Translations for less known VNs are still happening. Stop fearmongering, we're actually getting more translations for VNs than ever before.</br>   Kickstarter for All Ages <br>This is even worse than Grisaia</br>   This is most likely a stretch goal when the campaign becomes overly successful. <br> when <br> not if <br><br>I see they're being modest about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well, I wasn't saying what is still happening, I worried about the future, but who cares, I am learning japanese anyway</br>  <br>It's for both. Hell, even in the poll one of the graphical improvement suggestions is no mosaics.</br>  <br>yfw goal is $1million dollarydoos<br><br>stretch goal 3: buy koki another car</br></br></br>  <br>They're probably observing the enormous amount of people that's visiting their booth. And if Grisaia can get a successful KS, so can ML.</br>  I guess I am going to make a KS for something already translated, people are earning so much money doing nothing, and my stretch goal will be a surprise photo of my stretched anus in a pile of money  <br> AX panel in about three hours. <br><br>I hope they aren't scared away by retards</br></br></br>  dis gun b gud  They're going to use the scripts available and touch them up in case anyone was wondering.  <br>Ixrec is coming back to retranslate. Maybe we'll finally get correct unit designations and a proper Valkyries motto.</br>  <br>All the money in VNs these days is in Steam so All Ages being the priority makes sense. If the game is popular enough then they'll eventually also release a 18+ version.</br>  <br>MLA H scene aren't really relevaent, unlike grisaia.</br>  I kind of want to see the reaction of those damned streamers when they play the trilogy.  Reminder of the cancer you are supporting.  When is pewdiepie going to play Muv-Luv?    <br>They're not here so who cares?</br>  <br>But it's all about the gore with ML</br>  <br>Support nothing. I just want more people exposed to Twizzlers™.</br>  <br>I agree, he is a funny boy indeed</br>    <br>I'm not sure what you're trying to say. There are streamers playing literally any game that gets released these days. Does that mean you should never support any game?</br>    <br>Do you even steam ? If hatred is ok so is the gore in ML.</br>  Needs more Sumika.<br>There was not enough Sumika.</br>  <br>But muh teen-age audience</br>  Steam has animu backgrounds now?  <br>I miss Jilpoong</br>  <br>Let he rests in peace.</br>  <br>hes in the altverse now. you can join him too anon you know what you need to do.</br>  I can't wait to read an already translated game localized again.  <br>Gonna be a good excuse to reread Muv Luv. And hopefully I can get a physical copy for my shelf.</br>  <br>the real thing here is that it opens up translations for more things later</br>  Can't wait for this trend to backfire. Rapelay 2.0 incoming.  <br>But Violent Semen Inferno: The Maiden Rape Assault is already translated.</br>  I want a physical copy of Muv Luv to display on my shelf. And i'll gladly replay the game all over again.<br><br> From the start of Extra. <br> Doing every single route on EX and UL. <br> Will not skip lacrosse. </br></br></br></br>  <br>it's on steam?</br>  <br>I'm not going to support this because all I care about now is TDA, Schwarses and everything else not the main trilogy since it's already translated.<br>I hope you fucks are aware you're most likely paying to KILL and SHUTDOWN the current relevant translations. Once the Kickstarter is officially successful they absolutely WILL send C&amp;D to Gabgrave and cie, right when they're stepping up.</br></br>  <br>where did you hear that bullshit lol.<br>Cost around 50k-100k. not 300k</br></br>  <br> where did you hear that bullshit <br>Right back at you.</br></br>  <br>Nice source. There's no way it's this low when anime production goes well over 300 peoples for the animation production alone.</br>  <br>The only "active" translation is for TDA (and that's going at a snail's pace) and AF was never finished. If anything, they'll get Gabgrave and his translations for TDA anyway.</br>  <br>Animator slave labour is cheap, but not THAT cheap. One episode will cost you at least 150k under normal circumstances. 300k for high budget shows that don't look like shit as most anime do is a fair estimate.<br><br>Here's a source for you: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2011/10/30-1/how-much-does-one-e<wbr>pisode-of-anime-cost-to-make<br><br>Also,<br> lol </br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>If you read the poll they're considering translating the side stories and spin offs too. Schwarzesmarken and TDA included. Who would you rather translated this, a bunch of guys who have no obligation to deliver and have shaky records or an actual company?</br>  <br>It will likely be used to "show interest" much like Shenmue 3's kickstarter. They're probably already considering it on some level but investors want some money on the table before they make a decision.<br><br>At least that's one way of thinking about it, they could just be throwing out random suggestions that haven't been okayed by the nips yet.</br></br></br>  GOING GOING HIKARI E  Less than an hour for the panel.  <br>Is there a stream or something?</br>  <br>Originally there was going to be one, but due to network issues they changed it to press only. But they said they will upload a video of the entire press conference later.</br>  <br> much like Shenmue 3's kickstarter <br>But that's fucking wrong.</br></br>  <br>Whatever. Look I know you people don't like to pay for stuff, but if ML gets popular enough to justify the game company to translate the side stories (TDA, TE etc.), I am all for it.</br>  <br>But anon, some of them have already been translated by /a/! It's almost as good as Fuwanovel's quality</br>    <br>That actual compagny also has shaky records. Between one low-tier company that want KS money and waste time re-translating everything and some passionate fans that already delivered 4 games and several side-stories, which do you prefer?</br>  <br>True. I doubt they'll pull a<br> <br> We need 2 million <br> JUST KIDDING WE ACTUALLY NEED 10 MILLION! </br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded, they always said 2 million was the minimum. It's not like the game is canceled until it reach 10 millions.<br>Holy shit you sound like /v/</br></br>  <br>They practically said that the game would be shit without 10 million, or do you think the non open game was in the same quality as the other shenmue?</br>  <br>Ixrec is behind the translation and he's got a near-perfect track record. Degica's got no track record for VNs and KS, but IXTL/age is behind it and there's money on the table so they can't afford to not deliver. You're letting your attachment to a bunch of fantranslators cloud your judgment.</br>  <br>The money comes from KS they don't need to deliver the game to get the money, they can delay as much as they wanna you wont get your money back</br>  What is with this retarded trend of doing kickstarter or starting a petition to bring already translated VNs to the west? <br><br>Fuck this stupid shit. At least translate something like Muramasa or Dies Irae or Baldr Sky.</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded, mate? Speak logically, there's not even history of that even happening with KS outside of a few frauds that could be seen from miles away and this hasn't happened with VN kickstarters yet.</br>  <br>Lost cost high return</br>  <br>Haven't there been recent changes with both KS and the law that hold them much more accountable if they don't deliver?</br>  <br>The takeaway here is getting all age games translated if this is successful. Muramasa and Dies Irae aren't getting translated, learn Japanese if you want to read those.</br>  <br>They said it focus on the story, not that it's shit.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>dunno, but what guarantees that they will deliver in the schedule? What if they just make some corrections to the already translated game? All this can happen and I can't see why should I believe in these guys</br>  <br>Then don't pledge if you don't trust them. No one's pointing a gun at your head.</br>  <br>You're telling me most Muv Luv fans wouldn't buy Baldr Sky if it came to the west? It has a good story and actually has mecha gameplay. Baldr Sky would be the most easily marketable VN type game they could bring to the west and no one's bothered to do it for some reason.</br>  <br> Dies Irae <br>Trust me as someone who's read it, it's not the holy grail people make it out to be. Muramasa is good though.</br></br>  <br>yeah but the problem is if people start supporting groups that only translates for money(mainly the already translated games) and actual translators starts to abandon their projects to participate of this profitable new approach, thus leaving a lot of translators hurt and making it even harder to see VNs translated by non profitable groups.<br><br>And this sentence it's not right for me:<br><br> We also need feedback from Age and our major staff members as well. <br><br>They can't say that without approval from Age, unless this are only suggestion to be send for them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop romanticizing fan translators.<br><br> VNs translated by non profitable groups <br>You know this is illegal, right? No matter how you sugarcoat it, they're pirates and we're pirates.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh boy, please, is this the kind of people I am dealing here?</br>  <br>It's bad luck really. The two translators that bothered to pick it up, dropped it. It's a similar story to Air. It'll happen eventually.</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br> leaving a lot of translators hurt and making it even harder to see VNs translated by non profitable groups. <br>This is fucking wrong because they're bringing those very same translators and b</br></br></br></br>  <br>paying them.* Everyone'd rather work money than for free.</br>  <br>that's what I am saying, holy shit you can't even comprehend.<br><br>after some of the translator start to participate of these groups, the ones who choose to not participate probably won't translate anymore</br></br></br>  <br> the ones who choose to not participate probably won't translate anymore <br>It's a bit of a jump in logic to think these won't exist anymore but whatever. You don't seem to remember the state of the translation community 3 years ago anyway  hint: it was fucking dead. </br></br>  <br> Dies Irae <br>chuu2 as fuck</br></br>  <br> What is with this retarded trend of doing kickstarter or starting a petition to bring already translated VNs to the west?  <br><br>It probably has more to do with Age than anything, they've been pretty willing to poke into the Western market.<br><br>Blame the Devs of the others, not the translation companies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know, I just hope that these guys making these retranslations start doing some progress because I am full of this shit of retranslating while we have so many good VNs that were never touched</br>  <br> they've been pretty willing to poke into the Western market. <br>Really? Got some examples for that unrelated to this?</br></br>  <br>Ixrec, MG and age were in talks on bringing the trilogy officially until someone leaked the translation and negotiations freezed. A year later, Ixrec released the translation on his page much to Doddler's dismay.</br>  <br> If you read the poll they're considering translating the side stories and spin offs too <br>It's just the KS guys making promises they can't keep. age hasn't given the go-ahead.</br></br>  <br>Ixrec's been translating Harvest Festa and last year he finished translating Comyu.<br>Aroduc is translating Flowers with JAST.<br>GundamAce is translating Root Double with SP.<br>MG is translating three of Innocent Gray's VNs and translating all 14 chapters of Higurashi Hou.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Harvest Festa <br>It's ded anon</br></br>  <br>Is it?<br>http://amaterasu.tindabox.net/index<wbr>.php?page=projects</wbr></br></br>  <br>GundamAce is translating 12riven.<br>MG is translating Ourai no Gahkthun.</br></br>  <br>BlickWinkel (or is it ReadingSteiner?)'s apparently translating the Science series, teasing C;H Noah and R;N.</br>  <br>They made a decent fuss about TE in the West.</br>  <br>I read it and it was pretty much even better than I was expecting.</br>  <br>Some of those improvement ideas sound super ambitious. I could see them doing merch for high tiers, but doing routes for Alternative, or fully voiced Takeru/full dub? Or an anime? Is this poll legit?</br>  I'm reading TDA01 and it's much better than I expected. I still miss Lilia though.<br>How long it is? TDA00 was fucking short.</br>  <br>sen jutsuki-kun, weren't you dead?</br>  <br>It's legit, but it's basically just the Kickstarter guys throwing out whatever crap they can think of with no official endorsement from age.</br>  <br>I was only mostly dead. I got better, though.<br><br><br> no official endorsement from age. <br>Ah, there's the key words. Okay.</br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck. Its been over a year since I had to stop rading muv-luv alternative.<br><br>I couldn't get past the part where takeru goes  back to his original reality; but keeps suffering ptsd in front of his classmates and starts alienating them because he can't handle it.   I'm not sure what it is, but I'm cringing so hard I can't handle reading through it and watching him suffer. I just can't. I make it through one additional line and then have to alt-tab out. <br><br>Is it autism? I have no idea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're missing out on the best part Anon.<br><br>Fight on</br></br></br>  <br>Be a man.</br>  <br>That was the most painful part of the entire thing. Worse than comp or any deaths, seeing that innocent setting ripped apart by events from another reality was just cruel.</br>  <br>Didn't he have a gigantic mental breakdown in the Rance thread?</br>  <br>But Anon-kun, you already can!  Who am I kidding, I'll buy it again anyway. </br>  <br>What are the games behind?</br>  <br>The only problem with that is with all the old ass vernacular used in Muramasa, learning Japanese doesn't even necessarily mean you will be able to read it.</br>  <br>AkabeiSoft2 games. The two Sharin no Kuni games and I can't distinguish the third one but I'm guessing it's G-senjou no Maou.</br>  <br>It's not impossibly hard to read, the myth that even Japanese have a hard time reading it is made by EOPs.</br>  <br>If you made it through lacrosse you can make it through anything.</br>  <br>I cry when Yuuhi speaks and I have to decipher her bullshit</br>  <br>Oh boy that's not even the bad part yet.<br><br>You're not even half finished yet.</br></br></br>  Guys, guys, GUYS!!<br><br>What are the chances we might get console ports of Muv Luv in English?</br></br>  <br>30%. As a stretchgoal</br>  <br>I honestly found the slower parts of the coup arc harder to read than the lacrosse arc. It was just a sudden jump into long dense politics talk that felt so removed from what I found fun in Muv-Luv.</br>  <br><br>I moved things around since the rest were off topic. But the other anon was pretty spot on.</br></br>  <br>Maybe for a platform desperate for games, like the Vita.</br>  <br> And fuck harvest festa for being so big. </br>  <br> go to Gamestop <br> Muv-Luv in the PS3 section next to Call of Duty games and JRPGs </br></br>  <br>I loved that arc, but the scene where Takeru start crying after seing Marimo was the biggest cringe I ever have.</br>  <br>I approve of this man's taste.</br>  I hope we get Integral Works translated.<br>I wouldn't mind buying a translated copy of it, not to mention the game.<br>That's probably what this is good for. <br><br>Also if anyone is thinking this is going to blow up and become big or something, just look at shit like Eden on Steam. It's not going to be that popular because Extra exists which is zany as hell. And the only people that'd back this are people that've read the VN.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Rewirte <br> Sengoku Rance <br> Sharin no Kuni and the sequel <br> G Senjou <br> Tsukihime <br> Muv Luv trilogy <br><br>You've got the full EoP library of 10/10 games. great taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Do you not want to play Mabu Rabu on your Xbox 360?</br></br></br>  So MG is going to announce Alicesoft and Haruka.  <br>Nice books</br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Why would you ever need a strategy guide for FFXIII?</br>  <br>TLWiki IRC</br>  <br>Not really</br>  <br> IRC </br>  <br>Anon please, it was a horrible alcohol induced mistake, you're going to have to believe me on this one.</br>  <br><br>Why are the MuvLuv boxes so big? Is there something actually interesting included?</br></br>  <br>That's exactly where I'm stuck. <br><br>I just<br>can't</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The good kind of cringe or the bad kind of cringe?</br></br>  The tears of the MG staff when Jast announced that Innocent Grey was giving Flowers to them instead of MG were awesome.  <br>Oh boy do you have some shit in store for you</br>  <br>They got Root Double, that's worth more than all of JAST's announcements combined.</br>  <br>That's SP though.</br>  The best thing about this is seeing more people's reactions to the events in Alternative now that it'll hit Steam.  I wish I could play MLA for the first time again ;_;   <br>You're confused.</br>  <br> You will never experience CHOMP for the first time ever again. </br>  <br>Not terribly.<br><br>The second disk in MLA is a few minute video of the MuvLuv Extra opening performed live. They probably just needed something to justify having the long ass box for the art.<br><br>MuvLuv has the two disks for Extra and Unlimited as well as a demo disk with some videos on it and a placeholder. Maybe they originally planned to have room for Alternative?<br><br>Altered Fable has a DVD with various opening movies and a audio drama CD.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst thing about it is validating Ixrec's shitty job translating it, but since Sekai Project has already taken the shit fan project for Clannad that had large portions which were straight copy/paste from machine translation, their standards are obviously nonexistent.</br>  <br>Oh shit, you're right. What did MG get then? Only Alicesoft?</br>  <br>No idea, Doddler teased that there'd be a lot of stuff but I haven't heard anything.<br>Their panel is tomorrow, at any rate.</br></br>  <br>We have yet to see how the Clannad re-translation will turn out.</br>  <br>Good cringe? I'm not cringing at "wow this game is terrible" or something. <br><br>I have what I've seen other anons describe as severe second hand embarrassment. I can't continue, because I cringe, and have to close the program. I get it during some awkward parts with dense mcs in anime as well.<br><br>Its like I see the situation develop and I'm like <br> stop stop Stop Stop sTOP STOP STOP <br> close program <br> can't bring myself to start again <br><br>I've dropped several shows because I can't get through the first episode where this happens to me.<br><br>I guess I have brain problems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They say they've got big announcements, but unless they've got Eushully or Giga, which seem fairly impossible, Alicesoft seems to be the only notable thing. I'm sure they'll make a big deal out of some shit yuri game or more yaoishit though.</br>  <br>You could take your ritalin and stop being a great big vagina.</br>  <br>Thanks for the answer</br>  <br>Their yaoi title was well received and sold really well, for their standards anyway.<br>Wish they announced more liar soft stuff, old liar soft stuff.</br></br>  <br> i keep getting triggered <br><br>What are you doing on 4chan, Tumblrkid?</br></br></br>  <br> Eushully or Giga <br>We'd have heard of that by now, translators can't keep quiet.</br></br>  <br>I want to see them get Light, and then instead of Dies Irae, translate one of their eight thousand shitty games like Doki Doki Sister Paradise. That would please me immensely.</br>  <br>I still find it weird that they're doing Gahkthun without the rest of the WAB series. It seems like I'd be easy money for them, with the translations done and all.</br>  <br>There have been some rumblings in the past that Akabei Soft (Sharin no Kuni, G-Senjou) were interested in western releases, which would probably count as major, if not for all the rest of the stuff revealed so far.</br>  <br>Any recent light game would be nice, stuff at 1080 is always attractive. <br><br><br> we originally wanted to do sona nyl but it's hard to translate and the resolution is OLD <br>were the excuses given.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MG doesn't have a good enough translator for DA anyway. JAST at least got Makoto for Muramasa and even he gave up on it.</br>  <br>The translations are really bad though. I mean, sure, still above SP level, but since MG cleaned house, Ixrec is well below any of their higher profile translators.</br>  <br><br><br>No,I don't go on tumblr. Or have mental issues. Just pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you seen Electro Arms? It's like eMote, but somehow even worse.</br>  So what exactly was said at the panel?  <br>I've READ electro arms.<br>They got the super cheap version of emote that just looks really bad instead of nice.</br></br>  <br>Well you should probably stop watching/playing/reading anything intense then.<br>Have fun</br></br>  I sure am looking forward to being unable to even discuss the best translated VN here.<br><br>Anyone who supports this shit is absolute cancer. It's worse than fucking CR, but who am I kidding, you probably all have accounts and stream your anime while posting on Reddit.<br><br>Blow your fucking brains out, kids. This is a lazy as fuck cash grab.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a braver man than I.</br>  <br> This is a lazy as fuck cash grab. <br>No shit. That's SP's entire modus operandi.</br></br>  <br>It has bugs and stuff but half of the time you're looking at CGs instead of the sprites and the couple of routes that are decent have some good stuff in it.<br>Worst title that sub branch thing has, but still finish-able. And honetsly it looks nicer than paradise lost.</br></br>  <br>Paradise Lost is basically a doujin game in term of production value.<br>Still one of my favorite thing out of Light, I like it more than anything the secondary chuuni team of Light made anyways</br></br>  Will this ever be translated?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hLJ<wbr>n4XrhLkw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>It's obviously a cash grab, but if you really expect this to become big you're being silly.<br><br>Also it's nothing like CR, it's an official project by lxrec and they're getting the fantranslator to help too. Whether the quality will be any good I have no idea. <br><br>I just want Integral Works translated but this thing could easily flop</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know that CR is made up of former fan translators, right? And that this new project isn't just getting Ixrec to help, it's using his translation. We already know the quality. It's bad.</br>  <br>Yes, but unlike CR this is official, so contributing to the kickstarter to buy the VN goes to age/ixtl.<br><br>But yeah it's not going to be high quality and I kind of hope it doesn't get big since even though I want people to enjoy Muv Luv, I can imagine the cancer too.</br></br></br>  <br> We already know the quality. It's bad. <br>You better be learning Japanese because no chinese porn game translator is going to match your standards.</br></br>  <br>CR is official, you mongoloid. They have agreements with the broadcasting stations.</br>  <br>The cancer isn't going to be here.</br>  <br> We already know the quality. It's bad. <br>I see this in every thread, but can someone explain WHY his translations are bad?</br></br>  <br>The first translation for MLA had Rutherford as Lazaford.<br>He even failed to google katakana.</br></br>  <br>No. Because they don't know Japanese.</br>  <br>You know that Ixrec posts his scripts online, right? Go ahead and read them for fun now. Enjoy his in-script comments like "I don't know what this means so I didn't translate it," on top of him getting basic things completely wrong. In Rewrite, he translated the word for living room as "when people are having tea." There are plenty of translators far better than him, and editors who understand the basic rules of English grammar.</br>  <br>CR is a middleman, this is by ixtl and age isn't it? It seems Kouki is working on this.</br>  <br>Because they're very inaccurate, Ixrec has an incredibly warped view of what good writing is, and a very poor understanding of the rules of English grammar. <br><br>Tons of examples have been posted of mistakes he made in Rewrite. He actually told someone who kept posting corrections in his "report errors" thread to fuck off because they were reporting too many.</br></br></br>    <br> &lt;0386&gt; ネタ『31歳人妻です。浮気相手を探しています』を削除した! <br> &lt;0386&gt; You deleted Info: "I'm a 31 year-old housewife and my spouse is cheating on me"! <br><br>This will forever be one of my favorite Ixrec TLs because it's so basic that even Google gets it right.</br></br></br></br>  <br> VN kickstarters are always something we have read already or shit we don't want like Fault Milestone <br><br><br>Fuck this shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>His translations aren't good, but there are pretty much no amateur VN translators who can match him in sheer output when he does commit to a project.</br>  <br> //&lt;0189&gt; 「学生が固定資産税や維持費を捻出できるわけないでしょう。ここは金ロレね<wbr>」</wbr> <br> &lt;0189&gt; 「There's no way a student could pay the maintenance fees or the capital gains tax. They can barely afford a gold Rolex.」 <br><br>Another great one because he doesn't understand what capital gains taxes are (and those have nothing to do with this), doesn't know what Rolexes are, and completely misunderstandings the meaning of the line.</br></br></br></br>  I don't know anything about fansubbers and fantranslators, but Ixrec shows up a lot on both /a/ and /jp/ VN discussions, usually by people saying he's incompetent and an awful translator.<br><br>Still, he seems to deliver tons of translated games, while almost every other project gets stalled indefinitetly for the most part.<br><br>If he's so bad, then why won't anybody revise his work and release a patch?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because nobody has the magical power to tell what's right and what's wrong without going through the entire translation, line by line.</br>  <br>Him and Aroduc are the only ones who finish translating VNs in a reasonable time. There isn't exactly many more options for translators. You live with what you have unfortunately (unless you know nip).</br>  <br>Because re-translating thousands of lines isn't fun?<br><br>When you actually get to a decent level in Japanese, you do one of 2 things. Seek validation by translating shit for plebs, or seek knowledge by reading harder stuff. The first group is invariably much worse at Japanese, and honestly, you could run a game through Google Translate, clean it up a little, and have EOPs sucking your dick forever.<br><br>Nobody really gives that much of a shit if something isn't translated well. It's not like they've got to read it, and poor translations should incentivise the plebs to start studying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ixrec's slowed down to the same pace as everyone else since Rewrite, and Aroduc's slowed down a ton since getting a job too, but a lot of that's also because he did two games for Jast which have been sitting in Jast hell for years. He might end up with five games released in a one year span because of it though (LWR, BB, Seinarukana, Mystery Game, and BB2).</br>  I finally watched this movie today after putting it off for two years now.<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? <br><br> No seriously Bravo Gen BRAVO. I actually rather enjoyed this. Homu is still best meguca....prove me wrong faggots....PROVE ME FUCKING WRONG!  </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Mami-san hijack </br></br>  <br>Perhaps it could mean that he did not in fact use his voice, but his keyboard, so no voice was ever heard.
