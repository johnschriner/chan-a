Good afternoon, requesting my lovely Ai Nanasaki saying "Don't give up", or something similarly motivating, with gentle, but confident look on her face.  Anything is appreciated though.

I would like to request my beloved Mizunashi Akari wearing a sexy hotpants/short shorts with a top bikini, please!

Requesting Shion as a nurse or eating a slice of pizza Anything cute of her is fine Thanks in advance      clean     Summer really is here.   Generally if you received something this weekend from last weekend that bars you from requesting this weekend right? I'm conflicted.  Requesting Fujibayashi Ryou dressed as a Civil War era nurse, please, perhaps changing dressings or watching over patients. Have a good weekend, everyone! Outfit reference: http://imgur.com/a/4cDtn#0   In light of recent events, I'd like to humbly request my husbando acting cute/bashful  on a date with the viewer  in first-person    Th-Thank you for hearing me out, drawfriends.

Please and thanks!      A couple ideas this week. I'd be happy with anything!  - Requesting my waifu wearing Fatima's witch outfit from Luminous Arc 2! Any pose is fine, ans any variant of the outfit is cool too - either a version fitted to her own stature, the outfit as-is and her being embarrassed trying to cover herself, or an older version of Hinagiku with proportions to fill it out.  - Her dressed as Saber Alter or Saber Lily (looking at my past deliveries I kinda want to complete the set, haha)  - Her waking up in the morning wearing nothing but a bedsheet and a smile. More tasteful than lewd, if that helps at all.  - Cosplaying as another waifu in this thread.  Please and thank you as always!             Good taste in jackets.   Requesting a cute Yui successfully playing vidya.  Requesting Laharl with any kind of summer theme please! Something like at a beach or during a hot summer night or eating watermelon would be lovely!  If anyone is interested in art trades I'm up for it.     Great stuff, I wasn't expecting a delivery so fast, thanks for the drawing and the compliment, both are appreciated. She looks so cute here.  Sachiel in the back is also endearing. Again, thank you very much.     I have a lot of requests of Mei Hatsume that you can choose from:  -This one is probably really hard, but I want a picture that makes it look like she's inside the monitor, fixing the insides behind a shattered part of the background. And to make it look like there's a glass wall between the viewer and the inside  -Something that really emphasizes her eyes  -Cleaning/doing maintenance on her goggles (note that her goggles and hairband are two different things)  -Doing/wearing anything steampunk related  -Reading some blueprints with a broken gadget in front of her  -Wearing enough gadgets to cover her head to toe. Maybe make it look like she's having trouble walking with all the weight?  -Anything with her in chibi form  -Looking for her toolbox either in her room or in a workshop  Thanks for considering!                    Requesting my waifu Yukari.  I'm fine with anything, but seeing her dressed like something out of Mad Max or a Fallout raider or something would be cool.  Have a good weekend      Requesting lovely Sanya enjoying a nice summer day eating a popsicle or being too tired because of the heat but just seeing something sweet with her will make my weekend. Thanks and hope everyone has a great weekend.   Thanks in advance  Requesting Yuuko, anything summer would be nice. Thanks.   What about  muscle Yukari?      almost amazing trips    Requesting Inori lying on a bed hugging her pillow.  Alternative: Requesting Inori in Nui's dress with Void-like Scissors. Preferably without an eyepatch  http://i.imgur.com/4iAMLpY.jpg   Anything else is fine too.         Offbyone Kenobi.jpg   Requesting a slightly older (late teens) Victorique doing something along the lines of one of these things:  -Getting carried away with playing games on a computer (MMOs, CS, anything along those lines) with anon  -Reading a book alongside anon while timidly holding hands  -Learning how to swim for the first time with anon  -Doing her first book signing  -Perhaps something a little lewd like showing off some lingerie?  -Lying in bed and waving the viewer to come on over  -Dressed as a vampire or even as a real one. Cute fangs would be lovely as well.  -Anything one of you draw friends would think to be fitting  Thanks in advance if anyone takes up my request, I know you're all super busy! Also a friendly reminder to ignore any debates about her name, it's not worth clogging up the thread for it!                     Woah. That's really great anon.   Requesting something cute of Cathyl, cute lewd is fine too.     see  for why obvious trolls for whom stubbornness is more important than her shouldn't be encouraged.    That's actually a very good piece of drawing. Good job    pls. Just pls.    that's super good, gj.    As I said in that post, we can have a thread if you want me to explain to you what katakana are.    I'm not him, but last week was fucking stupid. I don't care what the argument was, but it shouldn't have lasted for 3 threads.   Cyan from show by rock rocking out in this outfit.    Requesting Hibiki relaxing while wearing DT770s. http://i.imgur.com/OjN3M1C.jpg    awwww.    those legs   Requesting both styles of Kneesocks interacting, like holding hands.

For specifics, request Honoka drinking a hot beverage in winter clothing.  Have a great weekend.      Can someone draw Suiseiseki as a tacticool operator with an m16?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127222865 <br/>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127222865   gets delivery   requests again  Oorafag please     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127222865  faggot check the thread    Oh neat~ this looks absolutely lovely, thanks anon!  Also those legs     The guy has been persisting on an obvious fallacy for four years out of pure autism, even though all he has to do is turn the audio on. Three threads are nothing.    glad you like it   Requesting Yutsuki.  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio, enjoying and dancing/playing Dance Dance Revolution.  For the outfit, you can draw her in her highschool uniform (in the ref picture) or in any casual clothes you want if you feel like it, as long as it's not vulgar/too lewd.  Anything cute would be good too.  Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.        Requesting Kyou Fujibayashi dressed as White  I'd like to request Nio wearing a plugsuit from Evangelion, please. If possible, please keep her bowtie on as part of the design. If colors are applied, it would be really cool if the color scheme could be based on the black, red, and gold of her school uniform.  If not, anything cute, funny, or cool would be appreciated.  Thank you to anyone who may be interested.       Requesting Rozalin dressed as Farangis from The Heroic Legend of Arslan, please.  Requesting Rangiku forcing anon to take her shopping for beach clothes.  Requesting Pamela coming out of the water with a very wet and skin stuck bikini while water drips off her soft, defined, curves. Thank you      Hmmm       to be fair (not saying one way or another) if someone sees a format they like they might use a similar one in their own request.    Yes, they do look quite suspicious.    I am considering doing the same. My only request won't get drawn and the "anything" part is always ignored.    I want to say that the first two are at least different people because two different IPs but I'm not so hopeful.    leave meibro alone    How would you know it's separate IPs?   Meifag and Hinafag are not the same people you morons. If you weren't so summer you'd know that.  I can't speak for Victorique but given the amount of autism that seems to be following him around he has his own story, too.     Appchan setting to display IP count for each new IP next to the post.    Why do you keep doing this?    You seem to be the third, at the very least.    supporting haremfags in a waifu drawthread    I guess the effort wasnt good enough this time around right?     mami     cute waifus     Not Oora!    Requesting Hagoromo Gitsune leading her hyakki yakou or wearing the outfit on the right side of the reference. Anything else is fine, too.  Hello everyone!, requesting Reimu wearing a bikini, maybe like the Asuna's one with that hawaiian style, or like Miku enjoying a drink on the sea, or like Hibiki with a flower in the head, you can choose the one you like it more for my dear Reimu,please and thank you in advance   OR here, thank you anon! Her outfit looks really cute.    Healthy!   Requesting Sawyer with a teddybear or stuffed animal of some sort:  http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1673276 http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1842966  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.j<wbr>pg</wbr></a>  </wbr> </wbr>    Requesting my lovely angel Kaede-tan. Since we're at the end of the season, I'd like to make a VA-related request of her dressed up as either Shinoa Hiiragi or Ryuu Lyon in their combat outfits. If you pick Shinoa's, one potentially interesting thing to note is that Kaede is over 8 inches (21 cm) taller. If you pick Ryuu's, giving her elf ears would be very cute.  Here's the ref for the outfits: http://i.imgur.com/49oj6jF.jpg     Drawfag delivery     Flatchouli   I love you.     What's the general attitude towards requesting both here and in the other drawthreads, assuming one requests the same character, but not the same thing? Is it frowned upon?  Requesting Misha in a zipper bikini or the lingerie in the bottom-right corner or like a trucker with the hat too, please and thank you. Additional references: http://imgur.com/a/CbSUD#0    Don't double-dip.     Is it frowned upon  Heavily. You can maybe get away with doing it on other boards, but if you request here and in the /a/ general you're going to get roasted.    Requesting Hex Maniac wearing some thigh highs, maybe with garters. On-model or 36J stuff welcome.   Reminder that he will just appear in the general if you draw for him here.     video game character    npc    Why is this allowed?       Quit pushing me around Phalanx! I swear once i'm done with the training arc, you will see!   Thanks for drawing, it does takes time and effort to draw even it it FLAT!       You ungrateful little shit.    tsuntsun ycake is cute.   Requesting Ryuko waiting to get sunscreen rubbed on her back.  Mine's an odd request but could I have Tenryuu in a mecha version of this tank? If the color scheme could be in purple and black rather than the tank's scheme of blue and metallic white as shown in one of the pictures that would be nice. If camouflage is a possibility though that would be pretty great! And instead of her sword perhaps an energy saber of some sort in a purple and black color scheme would be a nice add on too.  I can provide a video of the unit in action of needed, but it comes from an old RTS game.   Anything cute or  scary  will do if the idea isn't interesting enough!   Already requested, but how about something fun to try for drawfags?  Requesting waifu team attacks.    Requesting Junko Enoshima canoeing down a river of blood and dead bodies.  Requesting Futayo Honda dressed as a school nurse (Lab coat, Glasses, Sweater or a top exposing her lacy bra and Pencil Skirt. Stockings optional) or dressed as Namie Yagiri from Durarara!!  Namie Reference: http://imgur.com/a/EhPdW  I'm fine with anything as usual, Thanks!        Heres Eto, I hope you like it   Requesting a drawing of Len and white len doing a fusion pose, Or a drawing of len wearing frilly gothlolita like clothes.  Any drawing of len would be fine too.      Did I do something wrong in mine?      Thank you very much for waiting patiently for it. I'm sorry that I couldn't get it done fast enough. I got upset and tore it up due to personal problems. I'm redrawing it right now.    Requesting anything cute of my daughteru, Fiona Mayfield. Thanks in advance!   I support this. Maybe with waifus in PQ's chibi style.     waifu drawthread   ;_;   Is there ever any support for husbandos here? I've been wondering that for a while.       Which one of them?    plenty     I like this idea. Sounds cute.     No worries anon just do you best!    no one would pick my waifu in a team    Or even Persona style!   Im adicted to checking if she was drawn. Please offer help.       I can draw her so you stop checking    A watched drawfag never completes a 2-second sketch.     This sounds nice, perhaps there could be themed combinations (DFC group, short hair group etc) depending on the artist's preference.     Nice. You drew for 34!    Can you do ?    Onegaishimasu.    tfw your waifu isn't popular enough and well liked   everyone says you have shit taste  Fuck.     You must tell me who she is    This is awesome.    Fuck off Mimifag. Nobody wants your shitty Disgaea theme.   Requesting Pacifica as a cute sailor girl, please! http://img.ctrlv.in/img/15/06/26/55<wbr>8d58e48832c.jpg</wbr>   Kanna! In some cute outfit! thanks in advance!     But then everyone will bully me and her.     You do know 34 drew this the week of the "all waifus delivered" weekend     How the fuck am I going to draw her then?   Requesting this scene. But instead of Misaka trying to hold her skirt down. She doesn't care because she wearing shorts underneath.  Her face should be like a "I don't care". Perhaps shes busy texting, or her arms or crossed, or what ever you want.  (background and background characters of course not needed)       I've never heard of that before.    i really suck at coloring, but i hope you like it. you can rerequest if you want to    Learn to read minds through text.    Draw mine instead     I haven't forgotten you said "I don't mind her losing her funbags"    Requesting a list of waifu bust sizes starting from biggest to flattest.   Very cute.    I feel like you're someone I should be recognizing instantly, but it's not coming to me.  Anyway, super cute!      What if my waifu's varies?    Pretty sure that K or NotK imitating Harda style.    I like this idea. Should we make a list of the combat waifus in the thread?    Crabs    thank you    No. Combat or not doesn't matter.    This is super cute and I hope one day you draw my waifu.       I haven't forgotten you said "I don't mind her losing her funbags"   "Wow you should love you're waifu as she is it is only ok to shit on ycake for it!"  At least be consistent thread.      Drawthread is made of many different persons and opinions    ycake is for bullying    Y-you look cute.    It was an art trade and I think he only said that because he knows I don't like big breasts.    You don't bully your friends?     Not liking big breasts    Requesting my dear Ion, thank you!   But that's really cute anon, I really like it. I love how embarrassed she looks.  Thanks a lot anon, I hope you have a great weekend!      added to the list    I guess some people liked the format I use, but yeah, I had a feeling people would say I'm haremfagging if I posted right after the first guy you linked.   Requesting her sunbathing, or lying in some grass, please. Thanks for stopping by!     What name should I put by her picture?    彼女の名前は?    I wanted to draw her for you a while ago.  As you know still practicing so sorry for badly drawn wifi.      Junk Emoshitma.    Do you have a link to the colored bottom right picture you have?  I need it for reasons.      What's her name?    知りませんwwww    Damn, this is really amazing.    everything will be ok, even if she has no name    that's nice    holy shit nice    Pretty lewd, but she looks very relaxed. Good job.   Requesting.  Since it's her birthday today. Requesting Yuumi receiving her presents like the genki girl that she is, anything else is fine, really. Have a great weekend and good luck!     Why does Futayo get all the nice deliveries?    You keep improving your coloring with leaps and bounds, Twrl-senpai. Lovely work    Because he does art trades      Why does anon do nothing but shitpost at home alone on a Friday night?   rip this drawing looks like shit there goes my confidence   Requesting Lain!   ayy    What episode and time does she appear? You've been requesting her long enough to pique my curiosity.     bringing yourself up     very nice    Let's all love Lain!     The only correct answer     Thanks, I've been trying to focus on that a little bit.   What do you think of the last episode of Plastic Memories?  I thought it aired tomorrow  is this some sort of troll/meme op?  I'm going to miss her.  ;_;    Dropped it after episode 3, did they become a couple and did anything significant happen?    Shit, I've only seen the first episode, but from what I've heard if I skip straight to the end I won't be missing anything.     Isla got an upgrade, She's has big tits now, she literally sucked Tsukasa's dick and Michiru confessed. A lot happened.      there are some really tender and sad moments, honestly worth watching all the way through.   a new show hasn't made me feel this way in a while      Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related, contains all the basic info and much more:  http://buyfag.moe      Having dirt show on your figure's promotional shot     What dirt?    Right there on her tit.    Clean your screen, man.    Joe dirt    they want 14k for this  how      Not seeing it, unless you are retarded enough to think the shadow tones are dirt.    Time to clean up your monitor m8. Also meme girl is dead. Anime sold like shit, rip.     Literally nothing there.    Blind or joking?    Didn't bother watching the show, was it even any good?    That fucking face    Fuck no. Typical super special strong male MC in a generic RPG-inspired fantasy world full of girls who want his dick to varying degrees.     No.    no      I thought so, I'm a sucker for girls with twintails, and this bitch is pretty decent looking, but I can't be assed to watch the show when I could tell just from this gif its faggot shit.      I don't care about the meme, I like her character and I like her appearance so I'll just buy it.       /a/ didn't like it, its probably good.        asking /a/ if an anime was any good     Hestia is only popular because she's an H design in a non H anime. She's designed to be sexualized, that's all.    http://hestia.dance/   Taking all bets; how hard with Hestia figs bin.  I'm thinking at least 40%.    What's the quality on Q-Six figures usually like for the price? That Lovers figure is pretty tempting.   *my shiny teeth and me*  Nah, I like girls with twintails too, and that wasn't enough to make me like Hestia. It's not worth it.     still waiting   Design wise, her outfit is the only unique thing about her, dark haired twin tails are a dime a dozen, i can't speak for her personality or anything since I haven't seen the show but her looks are not enough to hook me.   God, I can't wait for the others to be released. Chihaya and Haruka are a must, personally. Yukiho too.  Still, at the rate they're going, it's gonna be a while     ANd you will be losing since the very start, given this one is made to order so it can't bin.   Got these recently, cute as fuck. I hope the anime isn't shit.   This isn't /v/ you fucktard.     dark haired twin tails are a dime a dozen,  So, are you saying we need to create new hait color to make a character unique.     I'm looking forward to Chihaya and Haruka the most too. At least its not releasing as slow as their figma line, which seems to have been halted in favor of cinderella girls.     Whoa, where at anon?    Haruka's gonna be last. Gonna give fans a reason to collect them all.    Mami is the perfect daughteru, and Ami is a shit-tier whore.  Being Mamifag is suffering.      Azusa and Ritsuko are all I want.    Meant to quote      http://shopping.hobidas.com/shop/g/<wbr>g110377</wbr>     Ritsuko should come out really nice, but Azusa im not so sure. Her art is drawn from a high perspective, it might not look to good in figure form but I guess we will wait and see how that goes. I think Chihaya is going to look stunning as long as they don't fuck it up somehow.     I can't wait for the Monster Girl merchandise. Figures when?  anyone know a cheap place to get movic stuff or should I just proxy directly off their website?   I wish I could, but I'm really running out of space and money.  Just gonna be Iori, Yukiho, Chihaya, Haruka, and Makoto for me, and that'll be it buyfag-wise for a while..      I SEE IT!   I'm so sorry      Hmm. Anyone going to go for her?   Yes.    They could have made a Saber figure instead. What were they thinking?        mfw      tits too big   wafer thin waist   Of course I fucking am.         fruit roll-up as a cape      They could probably get away with re-angling Azusa's head down a little so she's more forward facing. I agree, she'll probably be difficult for them to pull off, but I'll buy her regardless. Besides the wedding one, none of her other scales look particularly great either but I have them all.     When?     Takane is really the worst of the bunch, in this line anyway.  She looks like an old woman, and it's a shame because otherwise she's best girl.      I imaine Azusa will be leaning forward until her face is level. I really like her outfit even though I don't care for her as a character that much.   Red indicating that which didn't order/don't want, so I'm glad it's only the girls I want left now.   If only Takane had turned out better.        Oh shit now I want fruit leather.  Thanks asshole.      Why did they fuck up the Archer fig but this one looks great   Lucina's price on amiami is 6800JPY, which is the MSRP with Jap tax included. I thought they excluded the tax for the gaijin site?   Yeah I'd hope they take some liberty for the sake of the figure but who knows, I thought they'd mess with makoto but they didn't really do anything with her, and we still don't know how they're doing ami and mami.  Leaning forward could work I guess, could be kind of similar to yayoi.        tfw my screen is dirty as fuck and it actually looks like the figure is filthy      They up the price nearer release lately.    I really want to see some scales eventually.    This. I prefer shows with weak, useless MCs with girls lusting after every other cock instead of his.    The best poses are the ones where they have their mouths closed. They'll also be the least cockmongly figs, then.    I liked Takane's, but I seem to be in the minority here on her. The only ones I really don't want are Yukiho, Haruka, Hibiki, Makoto, or Yayoi. So I'm still looking forward to seeing the rest.       Because someone at Alter said   Hey guys, maybe we should turn him into fujobait to get more sales!   And then they lost mine and of around 8 friends that also wanted it. Fuck them. Hope Orange (GSC+MF) can deliver on a non fujoshit Archer in the near future.         She's going up on Japanese Aniplex+ on the 27th.     Nendos come out   Cerea and Miia have separate lower halves   Can make just about any Nendo a centaur or a lamia  Just go ahead and take my money.       How does a character become fujobait?     8 whole friends     Mind if I join you?     By turning him into a 16 year old pretty boy when he's far from that.     I think I have seen more people here that like Sexy Grandma. I understand the poses are based off the DVD covers but those poses are just downright silly.     scales  Wheyyy.     Cerea Figma when?    That would be a breath of fresh air honestly.   I got some art books from amazon JP and the box is much smaller than normal, maybe within an inch of the books on two sides.  The shrinkwrap was tight enough to hold them in place, but I don't want to risk it with them again.    It's more like someone said   let's use Takeuchi original gorilla arms design and not the updated ufo one that everyone wants  Seriously though I hope he gets another one because it's just awful      I always wondered if Amazon jp's packaging sucks as much shit as what I get from regular Amazon.    I think her design doesn't even translate all that well into a figure. Kinda boring when not in motion.     Is your autobiography getting an anime adaptation?     I do like Takane, but I will try get her on the aftermarket.  I have a lot of preorders at the moment so I can't exactly afford her at the moment.     want to get this babe   dont want my mom thinking I like fat 3dpd   I hate real life 3dpd but for some reason Pochaco triggers my penis.      maybe you should just kill her     aftermarket  judging how iori and hibiki turned out im kinda worried about the aftermarket for takane     show up for 1 episode   get wrecked   forgotten for all eternity   Literary garbage bin is suffering       who?    Even willard got more screentime   somewhere in the golden land lucifer posts on 2chan  I want to deito deito-kun ;_;   Such is the love that is not permitted     Who the actual fuck even liked EVA Beatrice? She was just plain greed-driven evil with no other motives. Lambda is the best witch anyways and probably the most good, chill, and befriend-able personality wise.     Chaotic neutral   befrendable   The moment something clicks in her cakebrain, she'll turn you in to taffee      Alright, I get why Rokkenjima was shrouded in the catbox thus resulting in a whole bunch of magic and whatnot, but why did 1999(or 1998?) have magic? Is it because we saw things from anges perspective? I realize that it was needed in ep 4 to explain the way magic works, but ep 6 and 8? You have the switching between featherine and the actual writer woman (forgot her name) and constant switching between magic and reality. It feels like a different kind of magic than the ones used in 1986.  Speaking of magic, is hanyuu featherine and has hanyuu completely lost it, or was she insane from the start? Kind of a coincidence when rika was about to lose all hope and die mentally that K1 somehow magically remembered a memory he should not have from a previous fragment, even though that had never, in a 100+ repetitions happened before. Coincidence or divine intervention?    Posting best Seacat.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127210232  I still haven't given up hope.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207836  dat ass   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127210423  it would be femdom       starts seacats thread not using beato, erika, kinzo or batora   thread sinks into oblivion   there's even one person banned       Mods are getting pretty jewish.    I liked how hilariously evil he is. Happiness of Marionette wasn't bad theme either.    It's kind of disappointing, considering we haven't had a thread for a while, unless I missed one. Then again, Umineko threads always take a while to get going.   I want to deito Lucifer even after being banned.  So... Erika was really legit detective? Or she just bullshiting her way into calling killer whoever she fucking wants? Like can she solve complicated case by herself or she isn't that smart?   Good god where did you manage to find such a good scan of this and are there more of the others?????     ?????     Glad you know how to read   How can you see anything with love when love doesn't exist?   What do you mean? Her logic is very good not to mention that she has an uncredible memory, it's just that she overlooked the magic parts as being pointless.  Come on ryukishi, don't let me down. Bring her back     How can you love without a penis?        Does /a/ ship Lucifer and Deito-kun?    Well, who else would you ship deito-kun with?       bern   friends     umineko is a fucked and stupid series  I want to rape Bernkastel and Lambdadelta so bad. I want to see them dominated and utterly powerless. I love them so much.   Well, yeah.She was Eva's Black Witch. The chain of hatred and sadness she suffered pushed onto the people of Rokkenjima and Ange. Unfortunately, it took 12 years to defeat her.  1 Episode  Anon, she's in EP 4 after Ange realizes that Eva was taken over by a Black Witch.          no dat u    So satisfying.    She was the best though. In such a small amount of time, she knew the game and fucked up everything.  The best thing is that she created a puzzle that has never been solved. That red spider web with Nanjo's death remains unsolved. Even the manga doesn't answer his death.        Wasn't that just Kyrie considering her wound was supposed to be in a spot which made her live for some time rather than killing her instantly?  The entirety of EP3 makes the most sense hypothetically with Kyrie and Rudolf. Eva found the gold. Rosa knew. Rudolf headed out alone to find Rosa and Maria. Returns with their corpses. Suddenly Kyrie wants to head out with Rudolf and Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi is the husband of Eva/The one who found the gold.  Yasu did the first Twilight. Eva found the gold, Yasu was defeated. Rudolf learned from Rosa about Eva.Proceeds to kill her and Maria. Her and Kyrie believe Hideyoshi knows where the gold is planning to start EP7 and kill everyone. Someone (Presumably Yasu) tried to take them out. Kyrie figured out Eva was gone as well cause Hideyoshi was smoking in their room which his wife couldn't stand. Yasu/Kanon protected Jessica from Kyrie who was still ticking and who killed Nanjo. Eva proceeded to shoot Battler, believing he's into their plan as well.                     And then her sisters derail the thread with shitposting.    what happens there?     &gt;show up for 1 episode  no, it's at least 3  did we read the same shit?          What the hell are you two talking about? That's clearly Eva Ushiromiya, she appears in all the episodes.    This is my waifu, do not steal.   there will never be more umineko   not even localized games, or new games for that matter     I fucking fight you.     Beatofags still exist  It's surprising to see you here.     Come at me bro.    Objectively best character in the entire thing.   dat voice          Objectively best character in the entire thing.   not Erika  It's like you haven't read Chiru.       erikafags annoying as ever     I don't even think Beato is a bad character.         I always preferred to imagine Beato's voice as a high-pitched and girlish witch, like Akiko Shikata. Sayaka Ohara was too deep and womanly and not very charming for when Beato is acting childish.       Your preferences are shit. Beato is a classy italian woman, not a generic slice of life animu girl.      That's Ryukishi on the back? Why does he dress like a poor mexican?     Why does he dress like a poor mexican?  Because he's the writer of Umineko, duh.    I finally finished Ep. 8 and I'm really confused. I get the core of the story, but what was that ending about?   Doujin when? Porn when?     Never______________________________<wbr>___________________________________<wbr>________________</wbr></wbr>     I know. Tis was worth a try, was it not?   You have to admit, Battler and Erika had a much more interesting rivalry than he had with Beato.   Well, no, there is an answer. The time when red is given during the story matters. When EVA said everyone's dead except for battler jessica and Eva, that was after yasu killed nanjo and committed suicide/was killed by eva, so EVA was able to say that everyone is dead. Snickers bar used the same trick in ep 5 and battler saw through it. What do you think everyone?    How good is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien?   Appearently called Rumbling Hearts for the official English release.     Watch what you are wishing for, anon.    Did you see the threads for the first two episodes of Death Parade? It would be like that, only ten times worse.   Mitsuki route is canon   Oh please yes.   Bakayuki is such a faggot.  Now that the dust has finally settled can we all agree Vanilla is objectively the best flavor?  Yeah   Yes.   If Aizu was around to see Bell two-shot lvl 5 floor boss, would they fuck right there in the crater?    Aiz is literally too autistic for sex. Having sex with Aiz would be like fucking a dead fish, she'd just lie there, completely emotionless. Which is gross.     No, she would just go to Level 49 and fight the Monster Rex there and reach Level 7.    That's my fetish   Only when you put Butter Olive Oil on it  Damn, they really ran out of budget, didn't they?   Which is fine because with their current power gap she'd probably crush Bell's cock with one hip thrust     Now that the dust has finally settled <br/>    But anon, don't you want to make her experience the joy of the D, slowly breaking through her autistic shell until she craves it so much that she forces you down instead and starts fucking you in ecstasy until she is filled up completely, and your balls drained empty?    http://imgur.com/a/9d5I0     she forces you down instead    Oh please.  I think I speak for everyone here when I say none of us want to get physically overpowered and raped by Aiz Wallenstein.        absolutely   Yes  This anime was good.  LN sale before the anime based on previously ranked Oricon data. 0001: **8,185 0002: *12,083 0003: *19,447 0004: *24,884 S001: *21,833 0005: *42,553 S002: *27,091 0006: *47,438 S003: *27,676  Now 0001: 182,894 0002: 151,467 0003: 138,429 0004: 137,213 0005: 144,255 0006: 133,122 0007: 134,976 S004: *52,839 0008: 106,514   Season 2 or Oratoria anime never though.                          Why the fuck not?    Dunno I like Lime.   What do you call a girl like this?  For once, an elf is not for raping. Ryu is best Machi    implying you wouldn't rape this   Faggot.      where can I buy this    perfect   Did they really need to asspull ANOTHER magic sword aside from Welf's? That fight was pretty bullshit already.   delicious    Ryuu flavor is best.    What other magic sword?    http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/<wbr>B00Y9Q7GG2 http://www.amiami.jp/top/detail/det<wbr>ail?gcode=GOODS-00037464 http://www.hobbystock.jp/item/view/<wbr>hby-ccg-00042914</wbr> </wbr> </wbr>    Stinky  Post the after shower version.       The one Bell uses to blow the fuck out of that Black Goliath.   I thought it was a magic sword since it released an Argonaut-boosted Excaliblast and then it broke. Also, Lily stared at it as if it was some important shit.   Or are you telling me Bell can use the Excaliblast with a normal sword?        The only way I can see raping somebody of her ability is by backstabbing. And she doesn't seem to trust others that far.    The one Bell used. He kept using knives for the whole show until suddenly it was needed for him to use a sword.   So how much fucking dosh is Bell going to get from that hugeass monster crystal?   Because he is pretty much the only reason they killed that thing, the other faggots were just buying time for him to do his MC things.      I thought it was just his argonaut ability that took the shape of a sword. Not a sword itself.    So, Bell has his hax exp boost and can level up in around one-two months, which is at least ten times faster than even talented adventurers. That means he can hit level 6 in just one year and explore the deepest known levels. But what with his teammates? They do not have any boosts, so when Bell joins top-tier, they still will be level 2 or 3. 4 at the very best. Is he going to change the team or drag underpowered friends into 50+ floors?    No, we all want to physically overpower and rape Aiz Wallenstein. Being physically overpowered and raped by Aiz Wallenstein doesn't sound too bad though.    That isn't a magic sword, that's a sword made from an item dropped from Ais "solo-ing" a Floor 37 Boss.    He can use excaliblast with any weapon.    Experience and adventurer level have no real correlation. You level up from amazing feats, not experience. If Bell somehow beat the minotaur on his first day, he'd be the same level as he was before beating the goliath, but his stats would be lower.       So he can transform a normal shitty sword into a magic sword-tier weapon?  Holy fuck, that's OP.      The sword was dropped from the boss Aiz soloed to reach lvl 6. Bell can use Excaliblast with anything, magic, punch or weapon.    Yes, definitely.    But I'm assuming the Excaliblast gets more powerful if he uses something like that right? What would the point be otherwise if you could just use a random stick.    Nothing. The crystal is confiscated by the guild as a fine.    He did that when 1 he 1 hit minotour using axe.   Who's the best girl and why is it Ryu?   Anime truly is only for marketing the source material.    No, he needs to to do something amazing AFTER he maxes his stats. Doing something amazing before having S in all stats wont level him up. This fight with supergoliath didnt level him up, for instance.    That wasn't a shitty sword to begin with, Bell didn't transform shit. He just charged an attack and that's it.  The sword you can only get if you try to solo the Boss and force it to another phase when he actually spawns the sword itself. It's a super rare item that Ais got and Bell ruined it just like that. This is another reason why Bell didn't get great XP out of this.       Fucking jews.    When he one hit 3 minotours    Because pointy ears    Because she's a strong, capable, experienced woman and also not a professional autist.    Are you level 7 anon?     Would you rather Ryu or Aiz?    based yasuda endcard    This fight with supergoliath didnt level him up, for instance.  I got bad news for you. This finale skipped a LOT at the end. For instance, Hestia's familia just got two more members, who are now level 2, and their party leader is level 3. And many level 4 and 5 adventurers don't have s-rank stats. In fact, very few of them do.      They deserve a punishment, it's their (Hestia) fault to begin with.     TFW I'm Level 28.     Ryu all the way.  Because she would actually understand the situation.      dead fish   not pouting and teary eyed  Animeonly fag pls      That doesn't change the question. Bell can git gud several times faster than his friends. After a year the gap between him and Welf/Lili will be gigantic.     Do you even have to ask?     what fine?      The former, because she's not a professional autist.     Lili and Welf joined Hestia's familia? Or did the samurai faggots join?    It's not rape if you're willing.     Am I suppose to find this girl attractive?  Because I don't.       Japan hated the anime   Japan loves the LN   let's give them more of what they hate by giving them more Rewritestia in the LN!   Why are Japanese editors so fucking retarded?   Hopefully never. We don't need JC Staff's directors ruining another season with their head-canon bullshit. It would be even worse if they made Oratoria, since it's actually really good.           Not you again.     Mikoto joined for a year. Lili joined after paying a big ass money to Soma famila. Welf never join since he's tapping Heph.      I'm confused, are you sure about that, or you're talking out of your ass? I thought bell leveled after that war game with the other familia. Also, don't stats "reset" after leveling up?  For having gods in the dungeon and messing shit up. It was more like a compensation, really.      Destroying a city, several casualities, bringing a god in the donjon maybe? Oh and destroying a fucking floor boss item drop    But she's gay.    It doesn't change the answer, either. One of them is a blacksmith, and the other is a long-range supporter. They'll get better in their roles as they go on, and Bell's stats have been near-max since the minotaur fight, anyways.     he can hit level 6  His already having slow ass progress when he hit level 3, and hestia isnt help either because of her cockblocking his training with Aiz and sometimes Tione.       now that the dust has settled    objectively   As unoriginal as your character       Oh so someone actually ratting them up for bringing Hestia and Hermes down?    that speech   Holy fuck, Hermes has some high level autism.     I thought bell leveled after that war game with the other familia.  Bell leveled up from beating the Minotaur.  Also, don't stats "reset" after leveling up?  No. Otherwise, he'd be dead.       Hermes is austist in greek     Can you still get it up?    I still don't see what makes Bell the "last hero", aside from his skills.   Yeah, he is kindhearted and pure as fuck, but it's not like there aren't other people like him.     There are?    Funny how the guys who brought the LN according to 2ch after reading like the other girls after, cant blame them when hestia was only relevant in vol 1-2.    Last hero of Zeus familia, literally    no, you moron - in games, when stats "reset", things like health, mana, etc. all go back to full, not zero.   Jungle twins = Forest elves &gt; Vanilla &gt; Oppai loli  ASShita ga aru koto    Maybe?  I mean, it's not like everyone else are huge assholes or pure evil.  Only the random adventurers who are envious of Bell and those faggots from the Soma familia are shown as kind of twisted.      You're trying to shove game logic into this, when the furthest it goes in this show is stats written on their backs. And you still don't understand how leveling up works in this show. Who's the moron? It's the simplest level up system ever. It doesn't even involve experience. It's just "did you kill a bigger thing than before? And Bell has killed two progressively bigger things.      His the last hero of the anhilated Zeus familia, there are other heroic vessels like him but was cut off from the anime specifically the other heroic vessels are Finn,Riveria,Garreth,Aiz and Ottarl.    I would hammer that    He can just one shot the goliath and not needing any weapon to begin with.     Bell leveled up from beating the Minotaur.  I meant from lvl 2 to lvl 3  No. Otherwise, he'd be dead.  How come? Aren't the stats just the result of the blessing? Like, everyone except adventurers have no stats. I was talking about stats as in agi, magic etc, not health, mana.   it's not like there aren't other people like him.  There aren't. He went from lvl1 to 2 in 6 weeks. Before that record was one year. Also he's extremely OP for his level. Also           That's new, thanks for the info     Oh, I thought it was more like "the last person worthy of being called a hero", I didn't know it was a legit thing.   So what the fuck are heroic vessels? OP niggers who descend from heroes?     Am I the only one who thinks Hephaestus is too old to be attractive?  She's at least 35.     He meant if it reset bell certainly die because his stats is zero in all field.    35 what? Boners?   God damn, is the ignorant/retarded shitposting ever going to stop?  I think I found out why I enjoyed this show so much. The harem doesn't have a shitty annoying tsundere and the childhood friend is actually a 6000 year old goddess. MC is strong but not OP, and doesn't have any goal besides "git gud". None of the "you're the chosen one" bullshit.  Sup   Yeah, but it's not like everyone else are saints like he is either.    She seemed to like Bell enough.    what are complaining about + I think she is a little more aged than 35      I meant from lvl 2 to lvl 3  That's from the Goliath.  Aren't the stats just the result of the blessing?  No, everyone has stats, but they can only be read by gods and elves.   I was talking about stats as in agi, magic etc, not health, mana.  Yeah, then he'd be dead, because if they "reset", he'd have 1 agility and get slaughtered by everything. Your stats keep through levels, because levels are more or less just a title printed on your back. Bell just has an ability that will let him hit the SSS cap before most people would.         did you just cram all 13 episodes into one webm    Here is one of the skills of  Ottarl Level 7 Title: The Monarch  Passive skills Boars' Blood- health passively regen Achilles Heel- can't be damaged unless damage at one region Divine Devotion- immunity to all magic damage Goddess' Protege- Self level boost  His active skills are unknown.                 Holy fuck, that's OP.  Though that "Achilles Heel" sounds like he is gone for good the second Bells finds out where it is.     When everyone's OP, no one is. Ottarl is just OP-er.    Please post lewd screenshots of the episode   Now, just remember that everyone above Bell's level has something similar.   Happy end get.    It's not a happy ending until Bell's dick is inside Aiz's mouth.     Lili looks like a little shota    You don't put your dick inside ice cream     Loki has most of the OP'd heroic vessels  What is Loki planning?     if you put it into a cake you may as well go for ice cream    No, skill is individual and not similar.    Faggot      Similar in the sense they all have something op    All the gods are old.   what is aiz's skills?   I meant more in terms of higher level adventurers getting abilities that -seem- OP.    Wind magic, can't remember the others    Faggot.    create vanilla ice cream out of thin air she doesn't go hungry in the dungeon    So what exactly is the deal with Freyja?   Well this is a good version of a god who's meant to be lame       What's even the point of going to the dungeon when you are this OP?  What the fuck does he do all day? Paperwork?     yeah in a week, when the new season starts.    Dramaticly stays behind freya     I liked the "one little attack" Bell has that obliterates a level 5 boss. Not to mention he used Argonaut twice in the fight.  How long do you think it will take for Bell to get as strong as Vanilla Aiz, counting since the beginning of his adventurer career?   I do. I want her to pin me down and straddle me for hours until I absolutely cannot go any more while she stares at me expressionlessly the entire time.    Can literally just a 2inch thick adamantium codpiece to god-mode.     that long hair  Is that the Devil Survivor artist?     She can transform into a male if you wish for it.    Going deeper. The biggest and best team recently got to level 60 in the dungeon or something like that. Going further gives larger rewards, which makes your family richer/more powerful.      Vanilla Ais cream is technically the literally best flavor.  I would invert her spoon on my tongue to reach all 9000 tastebuds, aerate her, warm her up, drive up that top note, that vanilla, that cream, sweetness.  She's a 10.        that last fight   So what did Freya have to do with anything?  So, Garzy's Wings reduced to a magic item?   To be honest, if they get one skill every 1-2 levels, Goddess' Protege seems shit, you theoretically get better stats, but in the endgame you'll end up with one less viable skill.  Well, same could be said about Bell's first skill.      What I mean is that there is no fun in going to the dungeon when you are so OP that there isn't anything that could kill you.   Niggah can't be damaged by magic, can only recive damage in one point of his body and regens his health anyway, and those are only his passive skills.      Wait, so he's actually stronger than Aiz? I remember some LNfag mentioning they fought at some point, who won?    Best girl. I want to see her and Aiz have a duel.    She had to clean her dress after soaking it during the boss fight.    I don't think there's any real cap in this, so people with exp or level boost skills are destined to eventually surpass the rest    Aiz would still destroy her, she's too levels ahead.    I don't think there's any real cap in this, so people with exp or level boost skills are destined to eventually surpass the rest    Being accelerator but instead of vectors its magic wind and godspeed   I got half a mind to just    Isn't Ryuu lvl 5 and Aiz lvl 6?    Can't Ryu at least put up a defensive fight with her speed?    Those are hermes winged sandals.   Bell is worst Shingeki. Took him 3 Plot bullets to kill one Titan    Having an exclusive EXP booster is only good if you're competing with other people or against a time constraint.  In a single-player game where you have all the time in the world to grind, it's fucking worthless.      This show went too fast.  They should've taken the time to flesh out some characters and some backstory instead of doing some powerleveling with Berry-kun.      love tenderly and marry.     Probably something to do with Hermes and his winged Sandals from greek mythology.    Ottarl obviously.    Ryu's 4 only.    I assumed level 10 cap. If that's the case, exp scaling will at some point make you one       But can they show me the power of the Japanese man spirit?    It's Sleipnir booties.    magical instakill again  what a shit show    The anime was set to cater it so yeah.  Read the manga/LN.     Loki also need love.  Has Ares donde shit in the LNs? I remember her being mentioned back when they talked about the story behind the Crozzo's magic swords and also during the gods meeting, so I thought she would show up later to fuck shit up.   JUST    Ares is actually male, and he's more of a gag character (pretty funny guy in Volume 8).  He attacked Orario for the 6th time and failed, this time having to give up 1/3rd of his soldiers (10k out of 30k). Tried to get Welf to come back and make swords for him but failed, tried to kidnap Hestia and failed cause Ais is too fast.     Just what?    nice, saved for future shitposting in waifu threads    F.A.G.G.O.T    Loki's not a very convincing cross dresser.     ruining Ais's personality, expressions, and design/outfits   JC Staff has plain said that they "don't know how to draw Ais"   inserting Hestia at every possible moment while shafting other character's scenes   catering to vanilla   Read the manga/LN.        Hephaestus best goddess elf best mortal    Some of the skills are not shown But what the heck  Riveria Level 6 Title:Nine Hells Her special ability is to cast 9 spells at once and one of those spells can freeze anything even time  Finn Level 6 Title:The Braver His skills are basically immunity to pain and high as fuck charisma and ability to fire spear of lights  Garreth Level 6 Title: L-Grim  Giant's Strength- He fucking lifted a giant dragon and toss it around like a frisbee disk, and one swing of his arm can create shockwaves strong enough to deal damage  Aiz Level 6 Titles: Sword Princess,mai waifu(literally)  Known skills Ariel- Wraps her in magical wind thay grants her godspeed and can act as barrier that protects her from anything including corrosive acids  Half Spirit Bloodline- Possesses the blood of a lower God/spirit                              He's only ever had to convince a horse before so maybe that's why       tfw no closure on what the hell was up with Syr/Freya   This really bothers me.       There is no closure in the LNs either because Syr isn't fucking Freya.   She might be related to her though.      Unless Freya has some kind of cloning magic, of course she isn't fucking Syr.      Nope, it's this dark chocolate...    I would     forced to transform into a sissy bottom bitch, but in horseform   Get raped by a big black horse cock   get pregnant and forced to carry that rape baby to term    your freak 8-legged retard baby is taken by your sworn enemy and used as a weapon against you  No wonder loki hated Odin and Thor       Why doesn't Freyja just get on with it and rape Bell?    Why is every mob adventurer so fucking ugly?  Why only Bell's male friends and acquaintances are cute shotas or bishonens?    Wait, so who the fuck was the psycho woman with long silver hair that seemed to be 'controlling' shit behind the scenes to develop Bell? They never showed her beyond her moaning and getting wet at watching Bell kill shit with Argonaut.   amen    What are you saying about these brown beauties?    She's  satan .    Because &gt;j cuck staff     I mean the males.  They all look like an adventurer is supposed to look, while Bell's male friends are all fucking handsome for some reason.     Freya, you see her at the gods feast, also before the sylverback scene talking to loki, she's a god obviously and a slut. Actually you need to be pretty dense not to know who she is    She doesn't want sex. She gets off on seeing brave souls and bell over coming great challenges.    What about those buff as fuck Amazonian dudes Bell ran into?     cute shotas or bishonens?  literally nothing wrong with that     She can only have his first time once. Gotta make sure he's at his peak so that his mind break is that much more satisfying.    thanks shitlord, luv u 2 xd    And she keeps hero souls in her heavens sextoy closet.    Loki Familia is the greatest.    sweet, this will make fapping to danmachi much simpler    You will never have a halfu elfu who is this happy to see you       So we can all agree that Bell VS the Minotaur was definitely the best moment in the anime right?   Just like in real life most people aren't good looking and no one cares about you.    I have a full elf instead    Well... it was the best this season.  Maybe except for reina and kuniko hike but that's just the /u/ in me talking.      Zeus     she's literally the most attractive character you shitmunching idiot   Best taste, reporting in.  Mikoto &gt; Lion &gt; Syr &gt; Aiz = Freya &gt; nonfactors &gt; Hestia     It was a really good scene.    It's a shame that the other fights from this show can't even come close.    Asufi &gt; Ais = Haruhime &gt; Ryuu = Tiona = Syr &gt; Mikoto = Lily = Tione = Eina &gt; Hephy = Demeter &gt; Anya = Chloe = Runoa = Filvis = Amid = Lulune = Cassandra = Aisha = Tsubaki &gt; Mia &gt; Freya = Riveria = Loki = Misha = Naza = Chigusa &gt; Daphne &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ishtar &gt; Hestia &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lefiya &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phryne    Are you for real nigga?   But of course it is!        watching SAO 2.0   expecting anything even remotely decent      For this season, yes. He was being a better Hero than Emiya Shirou in that one.    This most recent fight was nice.  No where near the Minotaur, but it was pretty enjoyable.     Haven't watched the last episode. Pistachio is best flavor so far.     SAO 2.0  Fuck off, this is nothing like Sword Art On Edge       Ryuu &gt; Aiz &gt; Loki &gt; Lefiya &gt; Eina &gt; Lili &gt; Syr &gt; Tiona &gt; Hestia &gt; Hephaestus &gt; Riveria &gt; Tione &gt; Freya     Is the dungeon the primordial god Tartarus because Hermes said that the dungeon specifically hates the gods this episode and that would explain why there are monsters in the dungeon.   So wait, was Syr actually Freya in disguise? Or does no one give a shit about that anymore     She isn't.    Syr is not Freya you fucking meme   When will the LN or manga catch up and be translated. I'd like to actually read this and not get the anime filtering.   I don't have any idea anymore. To many counter spoilers to tell what's true and what isn't without reading the novels.    Bell was raised by Zeus  No wonder the nigga is a pimp, kinda surprise that Bell havent raped anyone yet.    I didn't read the LN, but from the anime, it's rather obvious that she isn't. Under her familia, maybe, but they're different people.    They look fine in the manga. It's more that JC Staff can't even get character designs right when they're handed it on a silver platter, hence they fucked up Ais's design. They even made it so that all of the characters that don't look like jews in that shot are dark skinned for some reason. Fuck JC Staff.    Both are shit though.    Syrbis Freyja's "daughter"    This was pretty good.     Zeus "died" before Bell was old enough to understand the concept of rape.   He only got the shit about saving girls and being heroic.         main character is a gary sue with a move that wins literally any battle   good      She and Bell is pretty pure   tfw i just noticed pic related hand hovering.       Nice meme     Mutual hoverhands     Good meme. Well posted. Very nice.   I thought this would have 25 episodes. Jojo is over too, did Assassination Classroom end as well? I didn't see it at horrible subs. Am I left with only food porn? I might need to be put on suicide watch   Memes I love em     she is mine fuck off    tfw no more animated Berru-sama    Assclass is already confirmed for another season.    Fucking beta hoverhands faggots    3 overhands    haven't read Ontario yet, is that elf a stalker?       not hoverhanding  It's like you guys want to be called creeps or something.      Aiz finally gets a doujin. And it's fucking NTR. This isn't fair.   worse    Too precious.    She sorta is for Aiz. In the spin-off, she is kind of a mage version of Bell, but not special like him though.    I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going     vlc      DAMNIT JAPAN  Goodbye Danmachi.         Yeah, we all realized that was bullshit 2 chapters ago.  Not to mention this is all Hestia's fault for going God mode into the dungeon.       vlcsnap     s-sorry anon, I accidentally uninstalled the subtitles on MPC-HC while trying to get SVP to work     Literally grabbed by giant monster   not raped   Why is this allowed?       Ryuu's hair is dark in manga?    people actually defend this   is she ok?   why you are inferior?    Monster has no penis. Why do you think he's so angry?    NTR = best flavor    those robes are more tough than they look   Will this have another season or do I need to get  reading  ?   Except hoverhanding makes you look really creepy because of your aversion to so much as touch somebody else.    Why are you posting lewd?   Nice meme.        Nice meme.  Is that really the only defense you can think up? Calling everything a meme?     Start reading boy, season 2 ain't gonna come anytime soon.    Oh look, it's you again.    she's seen some shit    Nice meme.     Yeah sure... I'am totally going to open this... retards...     It's an imgur gallery with a bunch of screenshots.    underrated post   Nope. Hestia is and always will be best girl.   That blind faith in her husbando     But where was Syr?    Fucking annihilated     Right here        "Nice meme" is the dumbest meme.  Form your own coherent arguments. Don't be shit posting faggots.   It's less of an ass pull win button than Killua's sister, but a stun/interrupt would have been less bullshit than "I cast Magic Bullet. Fuck your HP bar". This show was fun, but completely generic and no one's gonna remember this shit in a year.  Don't kid yourself, you're only here because pretty animations of pretty people.              D E S T R O Y E D     Nice meme.    Except Hestia, but you already knew that.    But that's Freya    has the plot advance much in the LN? and is everything translated, even if its fan translated?    DESTROYED.jpg    Just because your memes are nice, doesn't mean you're right.    Digging your meme grave deeper with every meme post.    Blind faith is never a good thing.      #REKT      http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Dungeon_ni_Deai_wo_M<wbr>otomeru_no_wa_Machigatteiru_Darou_k<wbr>a  Scroll down and you'll find your answer to question #2.  </wbr></wbr></wbr>     you're only here because pretty animations of pretty people   completely generic  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.   no one's gonna remember this shit in a year.  I will. Unlike say SAO, which tries too hard, DanMachi took the standard formula and just have fun with it. It wasn't special, but it did what it was well and for that it was enjoyable for me.         FUCK! I swear while watching the episode didn't see the guy at all    Tiona look fantastic.    I do not take anyone who starts his "discussion" by greentexting   Either you have something to say or you go back to  with your cancer.       Damn kid, get fucking MEME'D     god fucking dammit, I want more Hestia    You're fucked either way anon. Hestia is a mascot character in the novel until volume 8.      Trusting LN fags      All those magical items and ryuu still stronger    Asanagi had a hard on for the whole episode.    So does she whore herself to hermes for special gear?    W-what happens in volume 8    maybe with the success of the anime some group will get interested in picking it up, oh well. Thanks for spoonfeeding me anon    The fight didn't reached a conclusion. I guess Ottarl had the upper hand though, but it wasn't a real serious fight and Aiz didn't used her magic.    Is it because he is a nigger right?    Author remembered that Hestia's supposed to be a love interest, and threw her a bone; at the same time though, author also managed to make everyone else (Ais, Lily, Haruhime fags) hate Hestia even more. If you get down to it, even the "bone" given to Hestia is just bait, because author doesn't dare to outright say Bell likes her unlike he did with Ais.  In a way, it's just to even the odds with Ais, since Ais BTFO Hestia in vol 6 and 7.       but not special like him though.   can copy any msgic and shorten their chants   one of those spells can froze anything even fucking time   not special  Please her skill is more bullshit        Ais did use her magic.    Dont forget her being a ungrateful bitch even after being saved by Aiz from getting buttraped by Ares.    She isn't stop trying to force that meme shit.     She's at least 35.  More like 350 or even 3500.       threw her a bone;   So what did she end up doing with Bell? Did Bell realize that he sees her as a woman?       She has her own cheat, but she isn't a heroic vessel like Bell is. Lefiya's cheat is powerful and excels at nuking like no other. She can use any and all elf magic there is.     More like billions of years old, it's best not even apply age to gods since they, you know, don't fucking age.     Has the author said anything about JC Staff's blatant Hestia head-cannon favoritism in the anime? I can't imagine all of these authors getting shafted over by JC Staff's rewrites are just going along with it, especially not the author of Sakurasou.    Huh, I heard different.     Is it just elf magic she can abuse or can she use all available types of magic?  Because if it's the latter, that's some beyond broken shit right there. That's way too scary.       Name two instances where she did anything worthwhile from volume 6 or 7.  You can't.    Some dude is dying and as he is still dying, he cannot forget the Goddess that he loved (Brigid). Hestia convinced Bell that it isn't scary to love a Goddess, because she would find him when he is reborn and convince him to fall in love with her again.  Bell says he wants to be with Hestia forever, but author add in he doesn't understand if his feeling is of familial love or romantic love.  However, Ais overheard the conversation, and Hestia's words with Bell reminded Ais of her mother, so I guess the exchange for Ais doesn't feel romantic?   There was an interview early on when the anime just aired to which Omori said he was surprised by Hestia's popularity. That was the only thing he mentioned.               author also managed to make everyone else (Ais, Lily, Haruhime fags) hate Hestia even more   And nothing of value was lost.      I don't care, Ryuu is there so everything is okay.      he doesn't understand if his feeling is of familial love or romantic love.   That's some cheap shit by the author, now he can just make it one way or the other depending on what he wants.  Or he can just cop out and not say which one it was and make an ambiguous end where we don't know who Bell ended up with.         She clearly casts her spell in this page. She even use her anti-boss nuke on Ottarl when she heard Bell's scream out of desperation.   I can understand people not liking Ais or Lily, but hating on Haruhime is just low class. Hestiafags truly are the worst.      I want to sniff Aiz butt.    Haruhime   Who?      The volume itself is just weird, because it enforces multiple times throughout the earlier chapter that Bell is very in love with Ais (more than just aspiration); yet, when Hestia chapter comes along, Bell got insanely wish-washy.  As an Ais-fag, the Hestia chapter was written very, very well. I like it a lot despite Ais getting cockblocked up the ass and through the mouth. Hestia actually feels like a Goddess in mannerism and charisma.  A lot of other people hated that chapter though.        The latter. Summon Burst is elf magic used to replicate other magic by way of bringing forth/summoning forth the intended magic. But so far, she have only used it to summon magic used by elves, which makes sense since elves are great with magic.      As expected of an anime only hestiafag.    This is bullshit and it doesn't make sense. But Bell knows that Hestia loves him now?     anti-boss nuke  What is it and what happened to Ottarl?     welf joins in volume 6    I want to say he SHOULD know, but I am 100% sure it's not gonna be mentioned again for another few volumes. The story's shifting back to adventures with the start of Part 3 in volume 9.    I keep seeing this and I haven't read that far yet. Someone spoil me what the fuck is going on here.     I sort of see why they'd be a little angry, right out of the blue Hestia jumps ahead of Ais because the author forgot to throw Hestia a bone.      Ottarl  unfazed and did not give a single fuck      That's the table of contents, silly. It's designed to look like your favorite panda doujin.     Lil Rafaga. Basically a tornado blast.  Ottarl got blew off his feet, got cuts all around his body, but otherwise shrugged it off. Ais held back last second though because she thought full power it would kill Ottarl (kek).   I think it's amazing that the author can convince me to like a heroine that I absolutely abhor beforehand with just a simple turn-around chapter. Honestly, Ais just need wee-bit more screentime I think. It's probably gonna happen in Volume 9 because she's main in volume 3 and 6.         The fags that try to make it seem as if they are an special elite just from having read the LN are just as bad as the diehard fans though.    She would get trashed by level 5 or 6. Trashed.     I just wish we had a competent translator working on the series, but it seems like it will be a long time until we will.     Yes of course. That's why it's bullshit, it's forced and sudden coinciding with Hestia's popularity boost.    Is there any actual statistic as to how fast or powerful these people are. Like a Mach number or something at least?    That's mostly because of Ottarl's insane passive hax. Between OP'd high level fighters speed usually decides a fight if there's no overwhelming differences.    How fast is godspeed?    At least there's Yen Press ...?    sudden coinciding with Hestia's popularity boost  He really should've done this earlier; even if that's not his intention, which I do believe is not the case, the whole situation just leaves a bad feeling.  However, I'm 100% sure the editor can influence Omori though, especially since he mentioned multiple times this title was not the one he wanted originally for publication.  If you follow twitter, DanMachi editors rode the Hestia hype like crazy during episode 1-2.            I hope you realize that the standard that's being insinuated here is that an anime studio has the ability to change the direction of a series simply by rewriting original source material with no consequence to them whatsoever. Fuck LN editors.    What are Finn's feats so far? Did he fight him too? What he is doing on that illustration? Is he stronger than Aiz?    That really depends on the level 5 or 6 she'll fight. Ryuu is more or less equal to Aiz in technique/skills and doing multi-task chants while attacking, defending, and evading using high speed movement. And if you remember, stats isn't always everything. Lower level adventurers can beat 1st class adventurers if the latter relies too much on stats and doesn't train well in skills/techniques. Of course, this does not take into account of affinity in passive skills.    And this arc was more "fillerish" than the others with love as the theme. I believe it's a one-time thing. After that reception I doubt they will try this ever again especially when they needed to cut Ais's screentime.    So there is no particular limit?    Yes but if she fights Loki or Freya level 5 she'll definitely lose horribly, she can prolly take Frune but that's the only level 5 I can imagine her beating.    Level 2 are faster than horse, dunno about the rest.   Does Bell ever get an actual sword?    Half Spirit Bloodline- Possesses the blood of a lower God/spirit  Is it confirmed?    So in DanMachi, chanting spells are OP?  Seems like you can get a bunch of people to chant while the others protect them, and nuke the fuck out of whatever they're dealing with.     I haven't read Gaiden 4 yet, but from what I know, Finn doesn't have much feats yet aside from displaying his name as Braver, which grants him amazing charisma to rally up people and motivate them to follow him into battle. He does fight in the fourth volume though and he is crazy powerful. He's probably the second strongest in Loki's Familia, surpassed only by Aiz.    He's not swordsman. He will keep using knives, there are already two top tiers sword users anyway, he is better like that.    Is leveling exponential growth or linear?    Volume 8 was a much, MUCH needed downtime volume. Omori said it's very exhaustive to read Volume 5,6,7, and Oratoria 4 continuously because they're all high paced/tension/action volumes. This volume is just like a breather after those.  As for Ais screentime, I am interested in when he will start Oratoria again. I think that series can totally stand on its feet after Volume 4 without relying on the main story.   Nope.   Spells in general are supposed to be able to turn the tides of battle in your favor. This is why Lefiya is so powerful now because they literally describe her a moving artillery.  Keep in mind Bell only has one magic slot, so unless he gets his hand on another grimoire, he cannot discover more magic.              Yes, magic is OP, Bell's advantage with his magic is that it requires no chant but it's weak compared to magics of the others, like Mikoto's gravity barrier though his can be used more casually. Magic is the ultimate weapon of an adventurer generally, and Elves are very good at it.    His faggot daggers are basically swords anyway.   can slice giant monsters to pieces like nothing even though the blade isn't even long enough to reach bone       She can only copy magic she has seen. Summon Burst lets her completely understand/analyzing whatever magic she sees instantly and she can double its effect/power using her other skills. Since she did copied the aoe nuke spelled used by the Demi-Spirit Loki Familia fought on floor 59, it can be concluded she can use any type of magic.   What is Oratoria?   nuke spell*   OST WHEN    VLC   SVP   Dude, you're just digging yourself deeper.       Thanks for correcting that, I was really worried there for a second     A lot of other people hated that chapter though.   a lot  The Aisfag from 2ch is just one anon, and it's embarrasing to read his shitty posts.      So Bell lacks the potential for another magic? Humans like Mikoto and Welf learned it naturally I believe, I am sure Bell would have learned Firebolt naturally but will it stay his only magic forever? Judging from his stats even with Realis Phrase boost, magic seems to be his lowest stat. Are humans limited to only one slot?   <br/>   It's a good guess, haven't read the LNs and I don't know if the author even cares.   So where is everyone watching this from?    This guy with Freya is Syr.     That creepy guy stopped posting a lot time ago.    So Bell lacks the potential for another magic?   For now, yes.  Grimoire can forcefully add another slot (but not exceeding the 3 limit), but Bell would have to buy one. I would give that book to Haruhime rather than Bell if I get another one.   Are humans limited to only one slot?  No, this case is only true for Bell.              Unlimited Magic Works  She has an amazing talent, too bad she is such a shitty character. Is there a page with her reaction to Bell reaching level 3?     ...Is there something wrong with you?   Can I call her Wally?   your stats only have to be all D or above to level (except for magic). Most people never even get to S in a stat.     Hating adorable female mage version of Bell who wants to keep up with Aiz as equals  Fag.     He got found out again last week.    So Bell's magic potential is low... Is there some magic potential tiers list in the LN? I know Elves and Spirits are high, Haruhime's race too(?) but which one is the best? Is there also some clear distinctions betweens the different type of elves? High/Dark/Classic?    I went back to make sure, she either has a teleporting ability or she was disintegrated instantly.   Friendly notice. Oratoria blows the main story out of the water in terms of plot and epic battles. The art is leagues better too.   Danmachi SS with Ais and Loki familia as mains.    What is this Oratoria everyone keeps mentioning    What is Oratoria about? Has it been translated much?    Aiz vs Ottarl   Why is the writing so bad? Oh wait its a battle shounen.   Fuck really? You got a link. That guy's hilarious imo.   Haruhime's race is Reynard (Renar).   Elves are adept with magic, dwarves have higher strength, Parum (hobbit) is the most brave; besides this, there's no other potential listing. They did mention High, Dark, and regular elves; not sure if there are any differences.      http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.<wbr>html?id=111503 http://www.mangaupdates.com/series.<wbr>html?id=110554</wbr> </wbr>                The manga is translated, not the LN sadly.    <br/>  L.N fags spoil me are Aiz and Bell a couple in the latest arc? Or is bell still your typical MC faggot?    Parum (hobbit) is the most brave  I don't see how it can affect stats, but as of now most of them are shit. Humans have nothing?     Have you ever been in a fight? I have, and i can confidently say i would FUCK YOUR SHIT UP.     The latest volume pretty much more interesting than the main story.  Aside from the lurking political thing and tense battles its pretty much delivers in some aspects like dungeon crawling more better.   floor 59   monsters spawns everywhere  That was scary         I bet Aiz would be the best emotionless sex ever    No.    Shingeki no Kyojin thread.  Isayama finished the manuscript earlier this month once again. Looks like he was energetic this month. https://twitter.com/ShingekiKyojin/<wbr>status/614466898206429184  The second recap movie is out in Japan, if there were some midnight projections we should get a summary of the new scenes in a few hours.  </wbr>     Annie is love Annie is life I love Annie more than anything in this world Annie a miracle of the universe Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out       D-did he just finish it?   I want to abuse the Bert.   He gave it to his editor so yes.    The manuscript took him around 20 days? Man, must be nice to be a mangaka.     Oh oh its anniebot     earlier   26th      He has to give it on the 28th or 29th.    I thought it was the 24th.    Fuck off.   http://imgur.com/a/liTW6  http://imgur.com/a/n7GjQ   Nobody cares.    We might get the announcement for season two of the anime. We got anime news after the first film came out after all.     Woah anon, thanks so much. I thought all decent anons left, I always wanted to read this chapter. Is everything on the second album from Isayama's blog?      I wish I could have all CR's school spin off chapters     Then make a thread when there actually is a fucking announcement and stop finding excuses for you shitposting generals with irrelevant infos like this.    Annie a shit.    Most of the pictures are from Isayama's blog or drawn for a special occasion.    Not him but you couldn't be more ungrateful.     when there actually is a fucking announcement  ok http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-06-25/2nd-attack-on-titan-co<wbr>mpilation-film-adds-new-ending-foot<wbr>age-linked-to-2nd-tv-season/.89681</wbr></wbr></wbr>      Great. So they're going to fix the ending they messed up. How unexpected.   Nips are currently wondering if SnK S2 could air on Kodansha's populair airing spot (Sunday 5pm, Arlan Senki and Nanatsu no Taizai got this spot), and if it will be one or two cours.   They're still keeping Fire titan Eren though. Too bad.    Bert is the best thing about this spin off.    That would mean more censor.    -S2 in April 2016 - 11 episodes (chapter 34 - 50) 6 months break -S3 in October 2016 - 14 episodes (chapter 51-70)  Final season in 2018, last episodes airs the week of release of the last volume, brotherhood style.        Source?   Is there any OTP more amorous than Eren x Rage? No, no there isn't.   Me. That's what I want.    Eren x PTSD is the new OTP. He stopped raging since chapter 50.    I'll dump more Chuugakkou Bert chapters during spoiler week. Maybe the ErwL and Hitch ones too.    Thank you mate, I love these. Is the Hitch one the one where she seduces Annie?   You guys think they will announce season 2 air date at the end?   I don't think so. They will probably announce it with the first trailer. I expect them to release it next December.     December  What the fuck. Now way they'll release it fall 2016. They're aiming for a winter /spring 2016 release.     Yeah that one.    We got the announcement and the first trailer for the first season in december 2012. Honestly with WIT's current schedule I don't expect the second season to air until the second half of 2016. The only indication we have is 2016, nothing about a winter/spring release.    It only took six months to make season 1, and they were in pre-production a half a year ago. Including this year, that's plenty of time to push for a winter release.    I'm sorry you feel that way.    Perfect.   To those who watched the anime before reading the manga, what was your reaction during episode 21?   The internet already spoiled the balls off that episode for me.  It was still sad.       Episode 21 was better animated. I didn't feel the impact of Levi's squad's deaths as much in the manga as I did in the anime.    Did they announce more drawings like this one for the second recap movie?   Wasn't the last time he was energetic about something, the chapter was shit?    When was it?    Which chapter?     this fucking chapter      I dont really remember, I think it was the one where Eren was asking Historia to eat him. I think I need to check the archives.    #LoveWins   Finally, they can get married.    What about the magic ankle?      gay marriage   legal in Germany  Not so fast       Actually it is.    You can, but Historia could just become the magic lesbian angel titan and fly them over to Amurica anyway.     shipping cancer returns  Well, this thread was fun while it lasted.     We can just ignore, its not that hard you know.    The pics won't load.  Anyone is having the same problem?     Reiner is best disney princess.    Apparently it is.    You cant be serious   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127215983   homophobe   implying I was not talking about cancerous shipping in general  k       I was pretty sure it was illegal. I must be behind on times then.     Hopefully we'll get raws by next week.    It has been legal for a long a time now.    New chapter of a new volume. Didans soon?    Eren still needs to talk to Keith. And we got AT and MT already last chapter.     And we got AT and MT already last chapter   Isayama forgets about them for another 2 years      So handsome ;_;       59?  https://twitter.com/ShingekiKyojin/<wbr>status/485088252768964608</wbr>         That was just editor-kun trying to hype a boring chapter.   The BR chibis got released a while ago, they look adorable.   My body is diamonds      I think it was another chapter.     dat BY   dat RH  Cute               Dat sitting Bert   Sitting Bert is getting popular isn't he?

Where is Erwin?     how do you hug a shingeki     now compare sitting Bert with sitting Ymir  Kek.      I hope so.    I think I remember some similar chibis of FT.     that beardwin  hnngg     Connie also sits like a girl.     Bert and Historia sit like depressed little nerds.     I didn't notice the Titanmir until now.    That's because they are.    Cutest shingekis.    I want to bully them.      Never forget Isayama's tombstone feet phase,    Ymir please.    I don't think he has gotten over it yet.   Price of Freedom has been out for hours in japan and still not a single upload.    being this new    New chapter can't come out soon enough.   wrong quote m8   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XCp<wbr>vAm75nxY</wbr>  [ ]  Aired yesterday on a japanese radio, quality is not the greatest.

So handsome it hurts ;_;    I'd rather have WIT take their time animating second season and release it on Fall next year. Their staffs need a long break after being fucked by 4 huge projects, with two of them being a clusterfucks.   Merchandising from the ufotable cinema.    The second recap movie is 2h10min long.  When are we getting the full version of this song? http://<span>youtu.be/W8F2He_DZjA  [ ]   When it comes out.    I want to hug him and tell him everything will be alright    Yea sure   Can we all agree Reiner is best shingeki?  Why is manlet so shit and can we agree that even Marco was a better character?   The only character worse than manlet is Mikasa.    No.    She's better than him. Manlet is just pathetic.  talks like a nigger   feels his manliness is threatened, gets violent   can't do shit on his own   is emotionally retarded          There is no one that is worse than manlet even Scatley is far better than him    This.    Manlet is actually better than Mikasa because Mikasa is basically a piece of cardboard that cuts things.    He isn't because she doesn't act like an idiot.    Reiner is best shingeki.    Nice joke.    Get the fuck out, tumblr fujo with shit taste.   Ackerman are love.   Manlet and Misaka are both shitto.    Mikasa isn't bad at all. Her only flaw is being in love with the ragetard.    Levi &gt;&gt;&gt; Mikasa   Preview of the drama (not the movie)   So basically manlet is a nigger?    Levi is just a retarded version of Mikasa.      That is so wrong on so many levels.      that Sasha and Hanji      They sure are making this as imperialist as possible.   https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/<wbr>status/614565421551763457</wbr>   Eat a dick dipshit, oh wait you can just bite her nose instead.    Ackersexual pls. Keep your delusions on tumblr.   Is the official spelling Bort, Burt, Spurt, Borp, or Barphole?   Erwin a shit.    Erwin a cute shit   I haven't caught up in like a year. Last thing I remember is Armin calling shotgun and a tree house party with Eren and the other Titans. Has anything actually happened yet?   Erwin a splorty shit.    Splortyhole    I would let erwin shit in my mouth   I keep hearing anons use this term, although I feel a lot of them have different ideas of what it means.  I'd assume it's when a show has a dramatic event occur when it probably shouldn't, possibly because it doesn't feel natural for the characters to act this way under that circumstance.  If so, can someone point to examples in shows like Clannad and White Album 2, where the drama feels "forced"?      It's just a meme and we all love memes over here.   Welcome to /a/.  We understand that some part of our terminology can be considered obscure by outsiders, and at times their meaning are counter-intuitive. We sincerely hope that this image helps you to understand a part /a/'s board culture.      Drama I don't like other people liking.    I almost feel sorry for the people that actually sat through Clannad. "Let's force all the emotions that were conveyed from a VN that was around 300 hours long and shove them into an anime."   It's very literally what it says it is.  Think of it like this  Character A has a problem that could easily be resolved if he talked to Character B. Instead he says it's nothing and runs off and causes shit to get worse.  If you're narrative can only progress because the characters are acting stupid then it's forced         Clannad did feel pretty forced due to the whole magical Key AIDS thing. Basically, I'd define it as when unrealistic things happen solely to force the story to change mood or direction abruptly, especially when not adequately foreshadowed. The best example, imo, would be faking that no time had passed after a girl wakes up from a multiple year-long coma in Kiminozo.    Things that aren't a big deal being treated as though they were a big deal    "Key AIDS"? Ahh... Nagisa's condition, right?    It's exactly what your second line says. When they act out-of-character, specifically for the literary purpose of creating more emotional situations.  What counts as "in-character" can be debatable when viewers interpret things differently, which is where all the shitflinging arguments come in. Sage because everyone already knows this and there's not really a point to discussing it.      It'd be fine if they didn't try to shoe-horn in the whole "she died because they built a hospital" bullshit. It would have still been shit, because the character writing was awful 9 times out of 10, but it wouldn't have been forced.   <br/>   That's melodrama  Forced drama is drama that doesn't feel natural. The best recent example I can think of was in Plastic Memories where there was a long tearful goodbye in the first episode.  Despite the fact that we've just met this character everyone treats her "death" as a total tragedy but as the audience it's kind of hard to care when there wasn't enough time to be attached.  It's a major disconnect between the audience reaction and the characters' reaction. So it feels like forced drama.          The VN isn't meant to take 300 hours, unless your Japanese isn't very good and you're using it to practice.    Forced drama is for myself a narrative story based term rather than the characters. For example, Tomoyo, having a bad relationship with his dad, and Nagisa being ill and struggling with school is fine.  But then heap on her dying due to having a baby when she couldn't moves for weeks on end, at what point did the writer think that wouldn't be fatiguing on top of Tomoyo losing a job opportunity and all the other stuff.  Also Nagisa deciding to have a baby was balls to the wall retarded. Then said baby   dying   it culminates in being abit over the top and trite.         Despite the fact that we've just met this character everyone treats her "death" as a total tragedy but as the audience it's kind of hard to care when there wasn't enough time to be attached.   This is exactly what Cross Game did, yet people say the first episode is one of the most emotional things ever.     Forced drama can fall into one of three categories.  1.) A dozen horrible things happen at the same time or over a short period to somebody/some people, in a way that seems overly cruel and over the top tragic for the sake of being as over the top cruel and tragic as possible. Ex. - On the day of his marraige, anon-kun's wife to be was gunned down outside the chapel by a random passing psychopath just as his childhood friend was run over by a speeding Japanese truck on her way to the church. His mother took the news so hard that she died from a heart attack while his father was kidnapped by his wife's murderer and brainwashed into a cyborg bent on killing the MC!  2.) A situation that can easily be resolvable, or not pop up at all if characters act even vaguely like Human Beings do, but cuhrazy anime misunderstandings or those characters acting completely out of character result in simple situations turning needlessly melodramatic.  3.) Usually plot and/or setting related instead of character-related, but when the setting or backdrop for whatever story is being told just requires so much suspension of disbelief that any drama that results from the story unfolding feels like you, the reader/viewer is being told at gunpoint "THIS WILL BE A DRAMATIC, TRAGIC STORY! ARE YOU CRYING YET!? WE WILL MAKE YOU!!" Look at Plastic Memories this season, where the setup of the universe with the androids just made little sense to anyone watching.        It's a catch-all term used by one of the various hiveminds of 4chan to justify shitposting about a work that is generally considered good.    hyperbole     I forgot to mention that autistic people can't into drama.    I could honestly see it taking that long if you don't use a guide and go for every route and ending     "Key AIDS"? Ahh...   Ahh...   ...  Get out you retard.        and go for every route and ending  That is the prime directive of playing VNs.     Underrated post   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127222939  Then go get an actual gf you permavirgin.    I think every single conflict in Clanned can be called 'forced drama' Things like 'You didn't get the job because your dad's an asshole' Or people say they get sad when Ushio dies. But I'm still not sure what she died from or why she died. She was just sick? Sick with what? She was just weak, like her mom?  Seems more like the writers just wanted to set up a situation purely just to make the audience feels sad.  1) introduce character 2) make audience like character. 3) Remove character so audience can be sad.  Then you got people saying "But that's drama. You don't understand because you have autism." No, it's not that I don't understand drama. It's you that doesn't understand shit writing.                Well you don't understand drama and you probably do have autism.     permavirgin  How is this an insult?     The best and most clear example of forced drama is Kokoro Connect.  There are emotional conflicts that otherwise wouldn't have been brought up if it weren't because of an external force in the person of Heartseed literally forcing drama with his supernatural bullshit just to observe their behavior.      Most virgins at least have the potential to lose their virginity sometime in the future. You don't.     You forgot about forced animation.     Forced drama = melodrama.    Don't worry Anon. Just enjoy what you watch and interpret it the way you see it. Everyone's preferences are different. Don't sweat it and watch out for autists and edgelords    ushio died, pls cry and be sad. she will revive later but be sad anyway   Forced drama at its finest      if the world doesn't end after highschool I get confused and angry     Forced drama = contrived for the sake of drama.       Ask why does he thinks X is an insult   gives the literal definition of the word  Fucking retarded, that is what you are. Oh, and anyone with a few buck can lose their virginity in a couple of minutes.       So melodrama.    Literally what happened with lucky star  ;_;     This guy talks from experience. Congrats faggot!    Yet you haven't.    No, melodrama is when you make a big issue out of something that's not a big issue.    So you don't even know what melodrama is. Why do you think you have room to talk about a field in which you have no knowledge?    Tee shit I masturbate to tells me I'm no fag, unlike you.   Indeed.       So contrived for the sake of drama.    Wasn't Kokoro Connect the anime on which people coined the term "forced drama"?    typical butthurt yaharifag. yahari s2 is forced drama     that first paragraph   Fuck, I'd watch that, if it spiraled into balls-to-the-wall action.       Contrivance and exaggeration are not the same thing.    A lot of people, especially anime fans, like to project themselves onto characters, plot lines, and so on. This is why a lot of MCs are betas, a lot of females are sluts, a lot of plots are forced dramas; because the average viewer doesn't watch the show for what it is. Instead, in every opportunity, they think "I wouldn't do that, that's wrong" instead of considering the character's motivation and place in the plot.   I mean, I wouldn't expect this from /a/, but it happens very it often.    Another recent example of forced drama: Senketsu burning away in kill le kill    it was the anime where people started to use the term a whole lot more because of the whoe fiasco with one of its VAs.     "Forced Drama" is the part of these shows that makes them shit. Does that make sense?    And this statement has what to do with anything?    They can be though.    That's not forced drama that's you know.. plot. You could say any antagonistic force in any work is essentially "forcing drama" onto the main cast.    It existed way way before then. I cannot recall but I think the first time I saw it was around the time Kanon was airing, when uguu was prevalent. I could be bullshitting though.    Are you trying to fuck with me right now?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223803   ...  Just kill yourself already and then get back to whatever shithole you came from.     Your response to either situation?     wanting to get a gf  Holy shit anon.     Why are you playing romance adventure games if you don't one day wish to acquire a gf?    You need to get at least one gf to get some perspective about the world.    Women are awful is an easy lesson to learn. Why would you wish that on poor sweet anon?     And just one should be enough to make you realize the truth of 3dpd.    <br/>    I get your point but I think the plot was forced drama. You could argue that any conflict arisen by an external force is forced drama, but you have to take account the mechanism in which the conflict is brought up.  It has to be believable and reasonable inside the world where the characters live in and it must have internal consistency. I believe Kokoro Connect was poorly executed in that respect.  I liked the show, mind you, but that doesn't mean that it could have been better if the mechanism that sets the plot going wasn't so outlandish.         Not really. If you find yourself a nice girl you can learn about life. 3DPD is an awful meme that encourages people to ignore the good things about relationships.     Fucking retarded, that is what you are. Oh, and anyone with a few buck can lose their virginity in a couple of minutes.   Tee shit I masturbate to tells me I'm no fag, unlike you.    Just kill yourself already and then get back to whatever shithole you came from.    Edgelord confirmed.              <br/>   Forced drama is definitely a thing but the shows that get called out don't fall into that category.   Because one thing is 2D, and other completely different and horrendous one is 3D.   That's like telling that you need to fuck a horse to have a perspective about sex.   Nice quotes there.            normalfags redirecting people to normalfag boards   Is this real life?        That's like telling that you need to fuck a horse to have a perspective about sex.   That's a very awful analogy and immediately tells me you've never had an actual sexual intimacy.      When something is thrown in out of nowhere or to any reasonable person wouldn't be dramatic. Usually it's just when they want to add tension but have poor or no buildup.  Then of course you just have times it's just thrown around because lolmeme        /r9k/   normalfag board  Is this some sort of new meme?       and immediately tells me you've never had an actual sexual intimacy.  American reading comprehension, everyone.     Most people use the term to describe plot developments they don't like.  Originally, the term was used for poorly thought-out or contrived plot elements. Stuff like Nagisa getting magic aids with minimal foreshadowing in the anime and existing solely to cause angst for Tomoya was a good example.     It means "nnot enough lolis fisting each other to stimulate my manchild mind' just ignore it    Forced drama is an overused term, but it generally means when unlikely circumstances or behavior conspire to create melodrama. Like when a character conveniently dies in order for another character to emotionally grow from their death.      implying not   Every thread on /r9k/ these days is about relationship shit. The wizards are gone.      If it's animated by SHAFT     tfw no gf threads   not normalfag-tier       HURR HAVING SEX WITH A HORSE IS SEXUAL INTIMACY   not permavirgin   Look, I know it's hard for you to understand, but girls and sexual intimacy are actually great things. If you want to cling to a shitty meme to define your sexuality that's up to you.        minimal foreshadowing  So you're saying everyone who watched Clannad and didn't like it is an idiot?     /v/ is filled with contrarians, not normalfags, get it right.   Fucking normalfags are shitting up this thread itself with forced drama.    great things  How about you watch legends of the galactic heroes, buy a body pillow, and lurk some more before you say your life style is better. If you want to cling to societal norms to define your sexuality that's up to you.     /v/ is reddit. Redditors are as normalfag as you get.   Just watch plastic memories and every time somebody is crying whatever's on the screen will be an example of forced drama   How else would you define your sexuality? By fapping all day to lolis? You need to at least have some actual contact with another human being to understand sexuality as a whole. Like, this isn't even normalfag territory, this is human being territory.   As I said before, I understand your need to cling to a meme in order to validate your sexual identity based on a fucking image board, but if you haven't even held hands or kissed another human being, why would anyone listen to your lessons on human sexuality?      The foreshadowing tying Nagisa's health to the town, especially with how extreme her aids was, was pretty poor. This is mainly because the anime left out a lot of secondary stuff in the VN and entire routes.     girls are great things   yeah great at draining your wallet like a vacuum      So can we start calling people who make anti-Clannad posts secondaries? That's what I'm going to do.    Not even that guy, but sexuality is a social construct. Ultimately, it's your life, and you just do what you want to do with it.    I can only imagine what kind of girls you've dated (or not) before. Fucking awful taste either way, anon.    Redditors have a hidden sub-section where pedophiles gather to share and trade child pornography, I don't think that's normalfag at all.    Go right ahead, because the VN wasn't very good either.    begone succubus there's no money for you to get here    sexuality is a social construct  &gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/  Anyway, you can do what you want with it, but you have to admit past a certain point, you have no fucking clue what you're talking about.        Fuck off, secondary.    If you want to shit post, then go ahead. Not like it's any different from your usual posting style.    You're literally saying "You haven't lived this way so you're life must be shit, you don't understand this" But I could say the same to you. Unless you actually try it how can you say the way that YOU live is better? You can't.     is this thread forced drama?   I'd say proper foreshadowing and development alone doesn't disqualify something from being forced drama. It relies more on suspension of disbelief, because if something was created solely just to push suffering and angst across, no matter how well foreshadowed, it's still forced drama.    Shut up, Dad!    Well your life is shit, and you don't understand this. Are you going to refute this?    Yours probably isn't much better if this is what you do for fun     If you want to cling to societal norms to define your sexuality that's up to you.    How else would you define your sexuality?   Obviously you have no idea what a social construct is, and think it's just a buzzword, since you were literally arguing for the same exact thing.       How about that scene early on when Nagisa wants to play basketball. It's raining but she shows up anyways, Tomoya gets down on his knees and says his arm is fucked and then Nagisa passes out. Would that be considered forced drama?   This.    You anti-Clannad posters discredit your own opinions by yourselves, I don't even need to be here.    But I enjoy my life. Who are you to tell me I'm wrong?    Unless you actually try it how can you say the way that YOU live is better? You can't.  That has nothing to do with what I'm saying. I'm expecting the very fucking MINIMUM.  Have you ever experienced your sexuality to the fullest? Have you ever held a panting girl in your arms? Have you ever held hands with someone? No? Then you have no reason to be talking about sexuality, my man. It's that simple.   I'm not even asking you to live your life a certain way, I'm asking the very minimum of what's needed and you haven't even experienced that. Do please keep going, though, I'd love to know what a /r9k/ virgin has to say.           Obviously you have no idea what a social construct is, and think it's just a buzzword,    Fuck off, Tumblr, sexuality is a very real thing, and you're just clinging to internet definitions for the sake of your online identity which doesn't even matter in a anonymous context, fucking retard.     Would you watch an animr where a METRICK ASSFUCKYON off lolis have a tea party. However each tea cup is secretly a biogenetic mecha alien and when they begin to drink their tea. The lolis fuse with the biotech tea cups and become gigantic mecha. And I'm not talking some faggot Mobile Suit shiy I'm talking LOLIS BIGGET THAN GURREN LAGANN. okay now for the good part. The lolis can only power up and use attacks by farting. The difference in fart determines the type of attack. like a little pomf is just a simple punch whereas a long wet shitty fart is a big magma canon and when the lolis learn how to queef somewhere around episode 745 (this would be a very long show) they begin to level up and get so bug they transcend dimensions  The name would be Ultimate Biogenetic Fartbots in Infinite Universes aretoo Cute as they Obliterate Eachother with Dank Stenches!     hes a normalfag. They tend to get pretty angry and obnoxious whenever somebody does anything that isn't "socially acceptable"    I agree with Clannad. The writing was very contrived in hindsight, and I actually quit on it once I got the gist of where the plot was headed.  But that's kind of a testament to Key's writing in general. It's VNshit and that medium isn't exactly known for it's prestigious storytelling.       Also Nagisa deciding to have a baby was balls to the wall retarded.   Now I know you are full of shit. Why wouldn't she want a baby?     What the fuck is going one here ?   Fuck off, secondary.     But I wasn't talking about Clannad.     There was a TV series called The Wire where a supporting character, desperate to escape from a dangerous situation, jumps from a third-story balcony, breaks one of his legs, but survives and manages to limp away.  That scene was actually based on a real-life event where a fugitive jumped from a FIFTH story balcony and survived. The director actually toned it down to three stories to make it more believable, and it still got blasted as a major "asspull" / "plot armor", and what have you.  "Forced drama" really exists, but basement-dwelling autists with no experience in life or love use the term FAR too often. "Why did he fall in love with her? They're complete opposites of one another, what an asspull!"        forced drama    So you'd disagree with your previous statement that you can only define your sexuality by societal norms, then? You're not making a lot of sense, otherwise    A melting pot of /v/irgins, secondaries, and tumblrites.    I'll proudly skip poorly written trash, no problem here.     Between anons ?     But eva wasn't harem shit. Its only fujoshit.     1.) A dozen horrible things happen at the same time or over a short period to somebody/some people, in a way that seems overly cruel and over the top tragic for the sake of being as over the top cruel and tragic as possible. Ex. - On the day of his marraige, anon-kun's wife to be was gunned down outside the chapel by a random passing psychopath just as his childhood friend was run over by a speeding Japanese truck on her way to the church. His mother took the news so hard that she died from a heart attack while his father was kidnapped by his wife's murderer and brainwashed into a cyborg bent on killing the MC!   This is a little stupid considering that this happens in action stories all the time. I don't know why it's considered bad when it's a drama. Dramas have to be exaggerated otherwise it would be real life and no one what's to watch or read a story about real life.      That depends. Do you view it has Nagisa is an idiot for waiting in the rain, knowing she will get sick and thus creating unnecessary drama, or is it a point of Nagisa's character that she is kind to a fault, something that Tomoya notices as he finds her waiting in the rain. Her intentions were good, but misplaced.    Why do I have to listen to you be an ignoramus? Go to MAL or somewhere else where secondaries breed.    is jumping off of 3rd or 5th story buildings supposed to be a normal life experience? I feel as if far more people then just basement dwelling autists wouldn't be familiar with that    Look, I know it's hard for you to understand, but being virgin isn't going to get you killed or something, specially when is dirt cheap easy to loose it.  muuhh that's cheating  And? Don't tell me you do it to fund a deeper bound or some bullshit even you won't believe.   HURR HAVING SEX WITH A HORSE IS SEXUAL INTIMACY  Holy shit, also read a book faggot.    How else would you define your sexuality?  So, being virgin = being gay, nice phrasing there.  And finally.  You need to at least have some actual contact with another human being to understand sexuality as a whole.  Even if you resume this as  You need to actually taste X to know it's taste  You talk like if having sex is a life changing experience, tell me, do you get enlightened or some shit after that?  Shit I was wrong since you keep posting, but this is fun so I'll continue:  Well your life is shit, and you don't understand this.  This pretty much sums your case, being an filthy ignorant peasant is worst than being virgin, at least I can tell that.    That has nothing to do with what I'm saying.  You literally used virgin as an insult, it's okay to be fucked up at some point but wishing that shit to others is the definition of meanness.                           It's when MC gets his leg broken by a car while saving a dog.    Play the VN. The point of view and mental wellbeing that led to those events is made quite clear.    You are supposed to empathize with the characters. If you can not no one will like it.    Pretty sure a couple of them aren't anons.    Most of /a/ doesn't read shitty VNs. If you weren't so new you'd realize that instead of samefagging desperately to defend your shitty medium.  Go to /jp/ and stay there.       I wouldn't expect this from /a/    its funny how just the other day someone was ranting about how anyone who does like Clannad must be a newfag.  it's almost as if all these words are just buzz words people randomly throw around at anyone who has a different opinion from them      Whatever is happening in here is surely something between sad individuals.      read   VN   misuse of the word samefagging  gb2/v/       I view it as the character being unrealistic and retarded as fuck. I can't believe how so many years later, I still can't consider her a well written character.    I'm saying all that shit is overrated, expensive, time-consuming and I'm perfectly happy, and there's nothing you can say that will invalidate that. Just because you value those things does not mean a life without them is worthless, and you are conceited for thinking so.    Do you know where you are?    Don't bother. Enlightenment can't be explained to a man like this. Perhaps one day he will glimpse the truth as we have witnessed it.    No, it's not normal, and it's even less normal to survive long falls like that. That's why it's a good example to show how people blast something as a forced plot element just because they don't have any experience or knowledge of it.  Hence why in /a/, nearly all romantic dramas are considered forced ...      Nagisa is stubborn and once she has her mind set on something she does it. Unfortunately, it ends up hurting her and putting the people that love her through an emotional roller coaster.     Rozen Maiden  I fucking miss that show.   I don't get why people use ellipsis on 2015.        This is stupid reasoning..     I don't get why people use ellipsis on 2015.  You don't get it, because you're ESL...   ellipsis  This should be plural: "ellipses"   on 2015  this should be "in 2015."          This thread proves that a lot of people here sling that 'forced drama' bullshit, because they don't understand how storytelling works. The same thing that they are criticizing as 'forced drama' are the same tactics used in action, comedy and any other story. Then to still call it 'forced drama' when it:  1. Has been foreshadowed 2. In character  is even worse.        how do you know this?     Forced drama is for myself  Then yourself has got it wrong. OP is correct.     Someone on /v/ had a link to it.    That pretty well qualifies for forced then, and you're right, it's pretty fucking stupid.     ..      You don't get it, because you're ESL  Not really.   This should be plural: "ellipses"   this should be "in 2015."  You should've used the ESLshit here.  My point was you sound retarded as fuck when using them.              The circlejerk of the ones who don't understand how a character works.       Are these redditors under arrest?    Nice samefag with those posts.    I don't know, but I do know they always change the name of that little subsection, probably so they don't get caught.    Tell me, great wise one, what did you learn about the workings of characters in your freshman creative writing class?   Let's kill this shit.  Poll up:  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_o<wbr>kQimnypuXlcFrTIF7POHLPpzCkf6AD6idNt<wbr>gr-R7g/viewform?usp=send_form</wbr></wbr>      Not really.  My point is you sound retarded as fuck when you criticize style while fucking up the very basics of the language. I was giving you the benefit of the doubt by assuming you're ESL. If this is actually your native language, holy fuck, I feel bad for you.  As for your question (why use ellipsis?): it's a form of shorthand. It means that although I've chosen to stop writing at this point, I could say more to further make my point. But at your level, you shouldn't worry about things like this.       Not very much, since by then I had already become competent in the field of paying attention you fucking ADHD.            So then I'm sure you're able to enlighten all of us ignorant poster about how a character works, right? Why don't you go ahead.    You said  You don't get it, because you're ESL  Meaning I didn't get it because I was ESL, implying that ellipsis is exclusive from english which is wrong faggot.  And yes I'm ESL   And you still sound retarded when using them.              You only think it sounds retarded because you don't know how the language is supposed to sound. Until you master the basics, you're not qualified to talk about style. Accept that you are ignorant, and move on.     I find forced drama usually falls in one of three types: when the universe itself seems to conspire to make things as dramatic as possible, when the drama comes from out of nowhere and ultimately serves no purpose, or when it's about something you, as the viewer, don't give a fuck about.  An example of the first case is Nagisa's death on the anime. Not only was she sick with this bullshit "weak body" thing, and for some reason didn't spend the last part of her pregnancy on the hospital despite knowing the risks; she had to have the baby on winter, while it was snowing, when the ambulance couldn't make it, and so on. Everything that could go wrong went wrong for no reason and she died, as if the universe was telling Tomoya to go fuck himself. Compare to the movie version (the movie itself is bad for its own reasons), where she simply dies due to her poor condition instead, and it ends up being a lot more believable.  For the second case, look at Ushio's death: out of fucking nowhere she's sick, it's apparently incurable (even though they never took her to the hospital), and she dies in an overly dramatic scene. All this is pointless since she literally revives not ten minutes later. The event didn't further the plot or develop the characters, it was there just got you to cry with it  For the third type, plastic memories' first episode is a great example, where they make a big fuss over some unnamed character dying        Again  Implying that shit doesn't exist in another languages  But I agree we should just stop this shit  and stop using them you sound like a faggot.           Explain why it makes any sense to stand in the rain long enough to get sick, knowing she has a weak body? What part of her character makes it alright to ignore common sense?        exclusive from english  exclusive to english.   in another languages  in other languages  How many awful mistakes have you made so far? Objectively speaking, any native speaker would identify you as the retard here.  Are you sure you want to continue?                &gt;Are you sure you want to continue?  Read my previous post, holy shit.     See if you understood her character you wouldn't be asking such questions. If you had played the game or at least paid attention to the adaption, you might have been able to understand her character.    Another faggot wrecked...    Nope since you still sound like a nigger.   I don't know if its been said yet, but forced drama is making something more dramatic than it already is, or having drama for the sake of drama. For example, someone loses an important game at a sport they love, and they quit playing that sport entirely because they lost. How is that believable if no matter what, someone will lose that important game? It takes us out of the story. Code Geass had some "forced drama" as well. Shirley and Rolo died for no reason other than drama and to conveniently take them out of the plot. Some good examples are episode 5 of Plastic Memories with the kid somehow sneaking into the quarantine area so that his now-wanderer caretaker can attack him, and the whole love triangle thing in Euphonium where Hazuki got rejected just so we can feel bad for her.       ignore common sense   Thrust me, in love story that's the one thing you don't see often, in real life too. And they are kids, kids for fuck's sake, they do stupid shit all the time and even more when they are in love or just attracted to someone. I've been there, and to this day i still can't understand how some people in /a/ defend and get nostalgic about those love stories (5cm per second), some of the most cringe worthy, idiotic and immature stuff one can imagine.         How is that believable if no matter what, someone will lose that important game?  To reiterate, one side will lose that game no matter what yet the character's despair over losing that game is forced onto us.     Come on, because she's so prone to being ill that she's incapacitated for weeks to months at a time and giving birth is extremely strenuous.   How is that being full of shit given her medical history?      So now you're being a stereotypical      Character A has a problem that could easily be resolved if he talked to Character B. Instead he says it's nothing and runs off and causes shit to get worse.  Except this happens in real life? People refuse to talk about their problems all the time.

I want to go to a performance by Akari and cheer her on as hard as I can.   Can't stop the lust for Lala.    keep it up!   Thanks to the anon that helped me with the last screenshot. Here's another. Is it related to draws? 50% chance to something?  I just want a June draw.       If you do a special buy (10 at a time) there's a 50% chance of Star brand for SR and PR (Rinne, June, Hiro).    Is there any guaranteed SR thing going on right now?    Thank you so much anon. Ok let's make a draw.   I don't think so.        Fuck it, the Prism's sparkle is with me. I'm making a draw once I get 2 more gems.   I fucked up. Stupid Hiro leave me alone.   You might want to wait on that it seems the Prism Sparkle is taking a piss right now.     Which Pri would you para?    Lala the rubbish idol.jpg     I should have listened. A mediocre Rizumu and nothing else.    Me too dude.    Me too dude    Me too dude.

I want to cum so deep inside Lala while she does that face and pose     PR   complaining      Do not lewd the idles. They are perfectly pure.    Refer to:       Oh hey, I thought she was an SR. I guess the prism's sparkle hasn't deserted me entirely.       There is too much sexualization of idols in this thread.     It can't be helped when it comes to Lala.   I'm surprised that you guys are getting SRs and PRs on your rolls. I'd probably get all Rs. It's like a 1% chance to get a PR isn't it?   Yes, and 10% for SR. I normally only roll during the 2 guaranteed SR events.    50% chance for a star helps a lot I think. But yeah.  They are all worthless if it's not June. Except Mion.      4 PRs  ;_;     Anything can be a PR if you have enough big stones. Don't let your dreams be dreams.    And luck with the evolutions. Quite a lot of luck.    You have to bribe the goddess of the prism. She rigs the rng.   I'm sorry guys I tried to axe the /pc/ thread but the /pc/ spam was overwhelming only got 3 axes in.

I wanted to start with Magical Change but I haven't been able to keep up with the live streams/raws and subs are non-existant.   Watch Happiness or Kira Deco first.    Start anywhere, just know that Lady is one of the outlier seasons.   Has anyone watched the Jewelpet movie?   No, because  no humans .    Are those jewelpets in elaborate costumes?

Enchanted Party is such a good song, it's a shame you could barely hear it in the vampire mystery episode, I almost forgot it existed until the new album.  Too bad I hate the song in today's ep  Looks like DreAca coming back was a one episode deal.  That's too bad.     you don't like Hey! little girl     I want to spank her butt.

I believe Lala should sit on my benis.      So deep inside Lala.   Good stuff.   delicious little girls   Lovely cat.    That was a disappointing episode. The performance was pretty awful compared to the duo unit ones. Everything completely clashed. If they were going to do a rock song, and Seira was in the episode, they could have at least had Seira give them cards or something.  has anybody uploaded pripara music collection album? cant find it yet   Senpai, please... I'm really going to cry if you keep pretending not to notice me...    What did you think about everything other than the performance?    Ganbare dude.    Decent. I liked the exchange between Akari and Sena.    Arigatou   Ded.  Like someone said above, the performance this week was the weakest part, but the rest was as fun as expected.  Starting with the performance, it really was clearly a "cool" type song, and made to be surfer rock. I was happy to see Akari and Sumire back together, but when Sumire whipped out an Angley Sugar coord I was just confused, and the song itself had a background reminiscent of Ichigo and Seira's Sweet Sp!ce.   That aside, I got everything I was expecting out of the wedding plot. Akari's squeal when she thought Johnny and Orihime were getting married was adorable, and their invasion to Dream Academy was nice too. Basically all we got from the DreAcas was a quick update on what they (and incidentally some of the Starlights like Yurika) have been up to. It was the kind of scene you know had to be forced to provide all the information and give every girl a chance to speak, but even just seeing them in the main series was good. Then the whole switchover where everyone thought it was Johnny and Tiara getting married and Orihime's jealousy, and the ending where Johnny suddenly has this kawaii imouto who he sends off in place of his dead father added some unneeded but pleasant backstory. That little ending scene where Johnny can't answer Orihime when she asks why he didn't ask for her to teach him how to dance left open the thread of them eventually getting together too.  And we can't forget the short scene with Akari and Sena. Yes, he actually did say he wanted to make a wedding dress one day, and Akari did in fact ask him to make it for her. It's hard to keep in mind she's only 13 when they pull such cutsey shit like that.        Fuck off.    Long time no see Robinho! How have you been? Still getting angry on the internet?    Oops    How does it feel that your shitty PG idol show can never beat Love Live? Aikatsu can't even lace up WUG's boots. Aikatsu is just a footnote to idol anime.    If it's so shitty, why are you drawing fan art for it?     Now this is my kind of anime.    not skipping the prism friends  Faggot       I didn't even know the segment existed until literally just then.    Literally who?    You'll never become a fashionable little girl with that sort of attitude.    Literally Yuu.    I gave up on being a little girl years ago    The Prism Friends segment is actually what convinced me to lose weight. I'd be fat as fuck now if it weren't for that.    Yuu a qt   Love Yuu.  Yuu.  Do you guys only like Yuu because she's unpopular and a background character? I mean, there are so many girls to choose from that are much cuter.     she's  a big girl        do you guys only like Yuu because she's unpopular and a background character  I liked her ever since Akari walked into her room for the first time.  there are so many girls to choose from that are much cuter  Pleb taste, discarded.        Yuu   unpopular      I like every girl.   How was the episode?  Would you kidnap Akari-chan?   But that sounds like something a bad guy would do.    Yes, and I would force her to  be my friend.     Really? I would  make her tell me the weather every morning.     I don't think I'm a bad guy...     I want to  wake her up  everyday.     Maybe.    Yes, but I'd probably let her go the first time she asked because she's too cute to say no to   FUCK MICCHY        Remember,  PP is winning.    And?     Mizuki a shit.     I'm not sure. Sena-san can get pretty scary when someone messes with his  muse_____ .    If being a footnote to idol anime means getting new episodes every week in addition to movies and new songs rather than two 13 episode seasons, I am perfectly fine with it.    Is that Marcus Aurelius?    What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at Starlight Academy, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Dream Academy, and I have over 300 confirmed special appeals. I am trained in gorilla concerts and I’m the top idol in the entire entertainment industry. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of producers across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Starlight Academy and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.     top idol      and I’m the top idol in the entire entertainment industry.      top idol      top idol        She's still the top of idle,  in my heart.         300 confirmed special appeals  How nice. I've heard you managed four in one show too. Four is pretty good.     I've seen a lot of half-assed versions of this recently. 5/10 put more effort into changing every line, the best recent edit of this was Oomori "Ricebot" Yuuko.    At least Mizuki didn't Prism Dive. She just got the greatest duo, Masquerade, to perform instead.     collapsing before even getting on stage   not successfully performing while ill and collapsing afterwards   having old ladies cover for you  Please.       She did go on though, and had a great performance. Bringing Masquerade back was part of her keikaku.   Naru's parents are lovely.   I wish I had narus parents    I wish I was Naru's parents.   Anybody want to share their fanfics?   I wish to make Naru a parent.   I find it unfair that the only reason why Skips might have won is because they're the main characters of the show.  Dancing Divas and the Jalapeno girls did well too yet in the end it's just main girls win.  Why didn't they just leave the voting to the next episode and have the little girls watching vote on the winners. At least that would have been acceptable.       Dancing Divas and the Jalapeno girls did well too   not mentioning unit with the cutest girl singing the cutest song with the cutest dance  Amafuwa Nadeshiko should have won.       Amafuwa Nadeshiko should have won.  But they suck.        not Orange Grape       Miyabi is just the cutest thing since Akari.    I will fight you.        my fanfics are not for the eyes of little girls     I love Miyabi so much. Now I finally understand that one anon who loves Mion.      that one anon     The one specific anon that loves her so much, and all of us as well.    Oh, him. It seems he hasn't posted in a while.    PRfags have probably left because it's ded and PP has close to no discussion topics. Threads these past couple months have basically been /aikatsu/ with sprinkles of "I want to fuck Lala" and no SHiNposting. Streams have also been shit lately.     I'm always here.   You're right, /ai/ is dying because the shows are dying, that and the fact only Aikatsu generates discussion and get subs.    It's good to have you with us.    I don't even know why I'm still here. I haven't watched JP or PP in over a month and I dropped Aikatsu. There's probably some small part of me still hoping PR will come back. I'll probably take a long break from /ai/ after the PP movie BDs come out.    I get you anon, but I'm just here for JP since Aromageddon's relevance is going to die soon anyway.    Remember. We are here forever.     I'm here because  you guys are my friends.    The season is almost over, time flies.   I haven't watched JP since the first couple of episodes. I wasn't feeling it. I didn't like Lady all the much either. Clearly a step down from Happiness and Kira Deco.  Did it improve?       Did it improve?  Yeah, it feel more like JP now, but still isn't near Happiness.     Was Orihime explaining it too hard to understand? She clearly made the backstage reports have a decent amount of weight because she wanted to expand what Aikatsu means to beyond simply the stage performances. AmaFuwa beat out Jalapeno in the first half because of their cute hiccups incident, but seeing Skips not simply dig through the pile of presents to find their dress cards, but also treat each and every one with care and thank the fans in their own way touched everyone's hearts. Akari and Madoka didn't address the camera a single time during that, so you could tell it wasn't intentional either. Jalapeno and DanDiva's reports were lackluster in comparison, but you could even see DanDiva get second highest because of their skills and experience together. Who knows what effect this will have on the story to come.     Who knows what effect this will have on the story to come.  Probably no effect at all, knowing Aikatsu.     Don't mind if I screencap that for later.    Please do, maybe that will jinx it and something will happen.   ded   jungle cat     alternate world OVA never     "ethnic"    They're all shit.

With the few hair I have in my head.    June is nice, and Rinne is good in a weird way. Bell's heterochromia is an okay gimmick. Otherwise I agree.    Rinne and Ito are the only ones who look the same as in canon. I wasn't counting them when I called the designs shit even if Ito herself has a shitty design even in canon.    Ito yes, but not Rinne.    Maho looks like a cute milf.    Your opinion a shit.  Ito a cute.      If this Rinne came next to you, would you settle for her?   When? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iSK<wbr>cCejCqcs</wbr>  [ ]   https://<span>youtu.be/6JgDnPSLcxw?t=9m58<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ] I miss Ayami.   best thing  I want Wakana to look at me like this.   Alt hairstyle Wakana is so lovely.      But there isn't.    braids Bell  I like it.    What's this from?    Manga that will never be scanned, thank you very much.    RL manga in Puchigumi which is basically /ai/: The Magazine.    Do you have that volume? I've never seen a non-full color /ai/ manga in a Pucchigumi but I don't own them that far back.   I've scanned several Pucchigumi volumes.        I've scanned several Pucchigumi volumes.  I don't remember too many PR manga scans.     They aren't really actual manga series but they're shorts. Unfortunately I only started buying them after PP started. If  is really from Pucchigumi though I might start looking for older volumes.     Here's a page from one of the Aikatsu shorts.     I don't own any of them. I found that page here.  https://nekketsunikki.wordpress.com<wbr>/2014/02/01/pretty-rhythm-rainbow-l<wbr>ive-43/  If the manga really does fill in blanks in between episodes, then I need them.  </wbr></wbr>       Unfortunately I only started buying them after PP started  Welp.     remember when Sophie was relevant?, yeah me neither    Thanks. Looks like it's from the monthly Pretty Rhythm magazines, not the main Pucchigumi magazine. Those are longer than the Pucchi shorts.  I have this one from the transition between PR and PP.       The Otoha lookalike girl is in a little corner in the “side characters” pages of the guide book, implying she really is Chips.     there was once a time when only Jewelpet existed  Those must have been dark days.   How thick is each volume?       She was pretty similar to Otoha when she appeared.    Of Pucchi or the PR volumes?  Anyways I found this, looks like it's from the last PRRL volume.    These magazines and their insert comics are so much better than the current PP ones.         The puchigumi ones.     wings  Ito made the right choice.     Around 95mm, 120 pages.    So much of what we do is ephemeral and quickly forgotten, even by ourselves, so it's gratifying to have something you have done linger in people's memories.    This sounds worthy of being the next tagline.      In PP is 32 times more ephemeral.       people didn't notice this  where are your priorities, man     Doremi is literally the best little girl show, sorry /ai/    Then why did it end? Checkmate, athiests.     The Otoha lookalike girl is in a little corner in the “side characters” pages of the guide book, implying she really is Chips.  The girl on page 42? I don't think that's the Otoha lookalike. The Otoha lookalike has a hairstyle similar to Otoha's.     Pretty sure it's her.   Hey! little girl~ https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=T5v<wbr>P1Nv9wgY</wbr>  [ ]   This one was great.   I'm not debating whether or not the girl on that page is Chips. I'm just saying that she's not the Otoha lookalike.      Is that the wings episode? Also those look-a-likes are breaking my brain.     [Doki] PriPara - 49 (1280x720 Hi10P AAC) [328C34F3].mkv   two releases in the same week  Not ded.     wow do I really have to ask my friends in nihongo to run out and buy this?    wait so, a love friends style cd rip exists on the internet already if you look hard enough. The rest of the songs are on nyaa from the other albums already iirc, so like, there's no reason to buy the collection unless you really want to hear falulu sing Make it! or want the endings    Not that anon but I want to hear Falulu sing Make It! very much. Unless it's not a full version then fuck it.    Hmm, makes sense, but I can't justify paying $40 to get 1 song...   It's surprising that love friends style is ripped and on the internet, but noone did falulu Make it! even though it's on the same cd      Yeah. Save the forty and buy this semen demon.     wait so, a love friends style cd rip exists on the internet already if you look hard enough  Do you have a link?     I want the OST that comes with it I can't get that anywhere else.     Someone linked it a few threads back and I can't be arsed to produce that link or a new one. Like a the good citizen I am, though, I feel obligated to say:  lurk moar.     lurk moar.   I've been on these threads since before they existed but I can't keep track of everything.      look for "ogg"     Don't hate the player hate the game.     I don't know why it's in Russian but okay. http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net<wbr>/prism-paradice/images/f/f0/Love_Fr<wbr>iend_Style.ogg/revision/latest?cb=2<wbr>0150617092156&amp;path-prefix=ru</wbr></wbr></wbr>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lip<wbr>ATbrZD3Q</wbr>  [ ]  It's finally done.  I'll post it probably a few hours before power hour.       I don't know why it's in Russian but okay.   Because Cosmoslavsquats are based.        Oh fuck yes.      That skinny font  You know how I feel about that, but okay.    cat  el muerto       forced to take a day or so off   pick a fight with Nee-san   we're using the term 'dead'   a lot of unidle vibes.   What the bloody hell happened?! It's like you want the Märchen~ to leave!   Also she is NOT the second coming of Otoha, they're nothing alike.   And when was the last damn time Naviko was brought up anyway?!              MÄRCHEN!     So very märchen.    Haven't seen Naviko since her show ended, so probably about then.   I want to fuck Aira.   Go stand in a lake in the middle of a thunderstorm Shoe.   why isn't he real  Boy or girl?     I hope he gets the inchou soon. He shouldn't have to resort to pleasuring himself with a fish.   Ready for the Dreaming Session?  I've got a few weeks off from everything coming up soon. Not sure if I should watch a season of JP (probably Kira Deco), or run through the first seasons of Aikatsu again up to the movie.   Is it me or are they using backlighting a whole lot in S3 performances?   So what's stalling magical change subs now?     I thought I responded to this earlier. They only really use it like that in Rin and Dancing Diva's songs, because those are kind of meant to be cool in that way and I think they want to play with their updated effects, like how there are a ton more reflections which are sharp and nice starting S3. The only other time I can remember it being used is there in Jalapeno's performance, and only at the very end.    Have you watched KD before? It's a lot of fun.    Currently 78th brother    I haven't watched KD so I don't know what you'd be missing out on, but I really suggest rewatching Aikatsu. I think I actually enjoyed watching it more on my second watch than my first, and it's really adorable watching some of the earlier episodes again knowing where they all end up.    Finally.   Watch KD, it's super fun and it hits you hard in a lot of senses by the end.       Yes   Another job well-done, Sena-san.   Now I want a Happy Meal.    Sorry if that wasn't clear, I haven't watched KD (or much JP at all for that matter).     KD and Happiness are fun. Twinkle is slightly less fun for a bit more serious. Lady is quite less fun but more serious. If you know Vietnamese, Sunshine is really fun. Pick your poison, lad.      Can't wait for Pri Para - 51   Why?    Princess      naru    Me too dude.    weeb-tachi please    ep2: qc everything else: tl     Laziness.  I wish I were joking but I'm not.      Just watch them RAW.    Obviously a girl. Look at those eyelashes.    Wow. These ranking brackets are unbelievable. Seeing this makes me think only 500 people play this game. In comparison, the Love Live game has prize brackets in the hundreds of thousands.    That would make /ai/ 1% of all total players, which is pretty amazing.   I don't understand how evolving works in PR Shake. Is there a guide? Basically, I just want to know if I evolve a card, can I max it out and evolve it again to the next rarity? Is there more to it than that? How many materials does it cost for each rarity?   It probably won't last more than a year or 2. I can see them holding events for all the main competitions then either shutting the game down after the queen competition or switching it over to PP.   It's based on chance. There's a very very small chance that the card will evolve and still be able to evolve again.         Ran, let go of her hand. She is /pc/scum, she can't be your friend.    http://maidforge.com/wordpress/2015<wbr>/05/pretty-rhythm-shake-guide-2/</wbr>      Senpai, I figured it out! You're actually a really kind person, I feel bad for doubting you for even a single second!  Lately you haven't been posting as much. Sometimes it's even as much as three days between each daily inspection. I was really sad you were ignoring me, but you don't reply to other people asking you questions anymore either.. then I realized. You're just a busy person, senpai. You're not ignoring anyone purpose, you just don't have time to reply to us all. You only notice /pc/scum to shoo them away! Even though you're really busy, you try to find time to make sure /ai/ is on topic even though you don't have time to enjoy it yourself. You're like a super hero! You selflessly watch over us all without anyone noticing.. but I notice you, senpai!     cat  <br/>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=13&amp;<wbr>v=U2aRPUHTVmc</wbr>  [ ]  I enjoy this.     I wish I had a daughter.    Oh nice find. I didn't know they made more.    I wish I was your daughter.    Great, I'm sure we can arrange something.    Is it legal to be this cute?    No, you're under arrest.      What if I were to resist arrest?      They were almost going to kiss.    What is this, Jewelpet Kira Deco?     These fucking faggot prize scores.   I don't think you'd be able to resist.    It should be.

Are we going to get a stream this week?   Looks like that's a negative.    Should I hang myself now?    Lack of streams isn't worth hanging yourself over.    I like the giggle. Very cute.    Poor Yurika.    Nah, that would be another reason to do it.   Kyupikon?   Heart pupils are usually lewd, but here they're just creepy.     It does make the idea look not so bad.     Reminder that the Prism World is in the other side.     Oy, come on everyone! Rinne won't come to the ded!   Well then, if Rinne won't come next to me, I'll just have to come next to her.    Just go till the end of the Rainbow, or let's play with the Weather and make 7 Rainbows.     Where is the  power hour   It's time, after being delayed for half a year.  I'll put up a DDL at the end.         Is this porn?     It is if you want it to be.        Just got around and finish watching the movie. I actually enjoyed it, Etude of Radiance was pretty good.  I tear'd up when Ichigo and Akari where having their pass the torch moments   What did you anons think of the movie?      Oh, this isn't the moms doujin. Interest suddenly down.    power hour is dead. We should just arrange to watch raws at the same time or something.     I don't think that one's even out.     GOAT          Seemed like a normal episode. Nothing special.  I didn't like how they just approached some random person to make the song almost completely. I would have much preferred Ichigo writing all of the lyrics herself, and having the help of Kanon to come up with the musical part. The best part was the whole sequence of them trying to get the cards to Ichigo and stalling for time.      How is that backlog going?  Pretty good. I finished Penguindrum a couple days ago and I'm now watching Muv-Luv for a change of pace. I'm liking it so far despite having heard nothing but bad things about it.  Alright. I'm watching Hisoka take on Gon. I never really bother with shounen stuff, but this is the most fun I've had watching anime in years.   Please pick atleast one   I started Katanagatari Shit seems pretty good,just finished ep 3 and that pv for episode 4 looks pretty fucking sick    choose hummingbird    Bakemonogatari   don't remind me  I started to watch the old HxH show, it is pretty fun so far  Watching Michiko e Hatchin right now, great fun. Got Tamayura More Aggressive on the go too.    Bake, Cowboy, or Kara    Finished downloading this. What am I in for?     Shit with a good joke every 20 episodes    Skip the first 2 episodes,they're filler. It takes a while to like gintama,about 20 episodes. if you dont like it after that you might want to drop it. Also, Sa-chan is best girl       Not good. Was on episode 44 of Rurouni Kenshin, but got in the mood for comedy. I've re-watched SYD S1 and S2 and the OVAs over and over again for the last month and a half.    I find that show painful to sit through. Like they're in a fight and they insist on talking until everyone dies on old age.    Even the first 20 or so gintama episodes are good, but they're not as good as the arcs or later episodes because they're introducing the characters and the setting rather than watching episodes where the characters have been established and introduced. This is where Gintama excels because the characters bouncing off each other really carry the show, so the first 20-30~ are not necessarily indicative of what most of the anime will be like.   What do you reckon?   I deleted most of it.    meme experiments lame    Monogatari for deep shit. Tokyo ghoul for hype fighting. HxH for classic shonen but actually good.   I've been stuck on ep 9 of utena and 14 of dtb for over a year. I don't think I can clear my backlog at all    I should've finished Escaflowne today but instead I ended catching up on seasonal stuff and adding more anime.     Cencoroll is short and good watch that, I think episode two is coming soon. Really cool concept.  If you plan to watch Kara no Kyoukai I'd say watch them all over a week with one movie a night so you don't end up rushing it.  Save Love Live before the movie BDs get released.            I might start Death Parade tomorrow. Has season two been confirmed?    Tokyo ghoul for hype fighting  The show looked like shit and was pure shit     Utena is shitty and repetitive but the akio arc towards the end is pretty good if you can bear to watch the steaming turd that is the black rose arc and not kill yourself.    Clannad, Anohana movie was just Anohana.   Pretty good, only got about 30 shows left on my hard drive to watch, then I can finally work on the 100+ torrents I have bookmarked on AB. I'm about to hit 300 tv shows watched and my backlog actually feels like it's getting smaller now. Makes me feel like one day I'll watch all the anime I could possibly have an interest in, then I can only look forward to seasonal stuff.  Currently watching Mononoke and I plan on watching the last 3 episodes tonight. I was actually extremely surprised at how exceptional this show is. I want to say it's a masterpiece, but I think that statement will need more careful consideration as 10/10 masterpieces are about 1 in 200 as far as my standards go.     Tfw cant decide what to watch    I had enough of Nisio for a day,fucking sat through Tsukimonogatari and Katanagatari today    Well, you know. I'll never catch it up.   I heard the second season was really bad, but I thought the first was ok-ish.   The ponytail strikes back   Photographer girl does things to my heart. And my dick.       everyone loved TLS, even the people who didn't like Tamako Market.     get in the band losers, we're taking photos     UNF   Find a flaw.    Naw, it all started with the incident with Harumi that got him run over by a motorcycle and hurt. Punpun was an outgoing and good kid before then.     So that's how her neck became so long.    Their relationship was never romantic. Did we read the same manga? They felt some attraction to each other but after that failed attempt at sex it was just friendship.    It's complicated. But at some point she develops feelings towards PunPun, but he's fucked up and doesn't know what to do, and the logical option for him was run away with girl whom he met at junior high because of an half assessed promise. Don't forget the suicidal pact.     Sachi definitely is romantically interested in Punpun, but Punpun is a husk of himself after the ending and has no interest in her bullshit. And why should he have to deal with some other fucker's kid?    A life with Aiko would have been astounding had they not murdered her mom beforehand. Much better than having to deal with Sachi's impulsive, self-centered bullshit.        You know how this goes.  Anyone happen to know of any good doujins with straight traps fucked until they're gay?    http://gyutto.com/search/search_lis<wbr>t.php?_adult_check=yes&amp;mode=search&amp;<wbr>author_id=40576&amp;category_id=9&amp;set_c<wbr>ategory_flag=1&amp;ref_path=%2Fsearch%2<wbr>Fsearch_list.php  Think we're missing around 5 things including what looks to be a tank?  </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>   meant for <br/>    No tanks there    http://gyutto.com/i/item104079  Is this not? Says 158 pages.      Just an anthology.   well?    it was the second magenkyou sharingan that fucked him up.  No you dont get it, Itachi was the good guy all along. But no seriously, sasuke showed up to protect naruto you dingus, why would you fucking tell him to try harder to kill you? You ruined everything.     Considering Naruto doesn't have the lightning affinity, probably not.  Nah. Sasuke never gave a shit about the village and still doesn't. Also why are their elements switched here when that's largely determined by genetics?  Naruto could've possibly been a rogue nin if he found a master and wasn't so dependent on Kakashi and Juraia and Ramen guy. Would've made for a much better second half.     Sasuke was actually getting better and then he ran into Itachi and he got Magenkyoued    he wanted to make sure sasuke killed him, that was both so Sasuke could be real strong, considered as an hero to Konoha, and so that Itachi could atone for his sins. </blockquote>]
