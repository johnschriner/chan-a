[ Fuck me Zaraki, those don't grow back you know  <br>Myuri will give him some medicine, he can make his limbs grow back after all</br>  <br>Decent chapter I guess and I'm still holding on to the hope that Monster Quincy is gonna be a qt grill for now.</br>  <br> Decent chapter <br>It's always a good chapter when Mayuri struts his stuff Zaraki is getting bodied pretty hard for a guy who supposedly stopped fighting while holding back.</br></br>  <br>either that or die.<br><br>So... pernida....</br></br></br>  <br>ehhhhhhh  no. </br>  <br>What was the point of Unohana dying again? Kenpachi has gotten more stupid. Still holding back despite almost getting killed after debut and getting his ass saved and in case losing an arm and doing the same thing which lost his first arm</br>  Is Zaraki retard moe?  <br><br>because it's fun for zaraki, remember that he likes to fight<br><br>There is no fun (for him) if she says Bankai (or even Shikai) and instakill the enemy</br></br></br></br>  <br> commander <br><br>zaraki and mangapanda both.</br></br></br>  <br>but unoihana's death taught him responsability and always fight full on from the start and that shit.</br>  Yes they do, it's called Orihime.  <br>I'm sure he's having plenty of fun</br>  <br>In bleach yeah they do, just wait for the group healer</br>  How many people have jobbed now to make Mayuri look even more based?<br><br>I love it.</br></br>  <br>It sorta made him a tiny bit stronger i guess. and quelled his cockyness.<br>Think of it like if Gilgamesh from Fate acted serious all the time with every fight. shit would be over fast</br></br>  <br><br>nah, he is still retarded. Proof is he doesn't use his shikai even after an arm destroyed<br><br><br><br>As i said, he is retarded, but at least it's Mayuri's time to shine!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was it really worth one of the best healers and experienced captains in Soul Society though?</br>  Kind of hoping for Nemu's shikai to be revealed here.<br><br>Bit of a long shot, but hey, I never expected Yachiru's to be shown either, so it's not totally out of the question.</br></br>   Mayuri gets his shit pushed in by glasses early in the series and only escapes with his regen trump card <br> Has been the strongest character in the series ever since then <br>Does Kubo have a boner for him or something?</br></br>  <br>Mayuri has taken out like 6 Captain class fighters this arc, something like that. Nigga is now embarrassing Kenpachi and the super Nazi thing simultaneously and earlier also made Askin walk away. He even talked shit to Yama's face and got away with it. If you try to fuck with him he will introduce your angus to the most arcane concepts you can't possibly imagine.</br>  <br> not having at least one original and two artificially implanted boners for mayuri-sama at all times </br>   controls people by inserting it's nerves into their bodies and taking over <br><br>Then how did it break those trees way back during the fight against the Royal Guard? Shouldn't that power only work on things that have nerves?</br></br>  <br><br>I think Kubo likes writing characters like Mayuri and Aizen more than he does the others.</br></br>  <br> Hype Kenpachi up as the strongest shinigami since sliced bread <br> Kills a dude that can control reality <br> Gets beat by nerves and stupidity <br><br>And Mayuri is fucking toying with him. I mean I expect the old "My power is actually" back and forth for a while.<br><br>Seriously though, Mayuri has done the bulk of the successful fighting himself in this war.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri was toying with Uryuu until he pulled the "technique that will make me 100 times more powerful but make me lose my powers afterwards, at least until the next arc where I get them back through some convenient plot device" card. That and the friend sacrifice power ups are the most effective and unbeatable power ups in shounen.</br>  <br><br>MAUYRI NEXT SOUL KING!</br></br>  <br>For christ sakes, how many times does this need to be repeated.<br><br>The point of Unohana's fight with Zaraki wasn't about Zaraki's power-up. At least not in the first place. It was more about telling and completing her backstory that we never got. <br><br>Zaraki's power-up was secondary result of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> exploding knees: the chapter </br>  <br>The narrative point of it was that, but there also needs to be an "in character" reason for the way characters act and that reason needs to have impact if it's carried out.</br>  <br>He didn't really even beat Gremmy. It was literally death by stupidity, he was and could have continued running circles around Kenpachi if he wasn't such a dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Still a shitty story device, Unohana death could have been better by having her fight versus an actual enemy and making zaraki arrive in her last moments</br></br>  <br><br>Could have been plain old spiritual pressure. Or maybe he's not only restricted to using nerves.<br><br>The correct answer is always kubo making shit up as he goes along</br></br></br></br>  shinigami are spirits how can they haves nerves. kubo messed up.  <br> Become all powerful <br> Be too retarded to make any use of it <br>Kubo is too deep.</br></br></br>  <br>That's meta knowledge though, what he's asking is what purposes in universe is there.</br>  <br><br>Good thing you weren't here for the Rukia Bankai chapters then</br></br>  <br> kills a person whose Bankai is literally about melting the flesh of her opponents <br> kills the top medic in Soul Society <br> all to give one guy a vague chance of a power-up <br><br>I'm pretty sure Unohana's death was less about her backstory, and more about Kubo wanting an excuse to have characters drop like flies. Can't have edgy death counts if there's a medic around I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't here but it was pretty dumb. worrying about body temperature.</br>  <br><br>Does that mean Orihime's going to bite the dust too?</br></br>  <br> Orihime <br>You know what? I honestly forgot she existed, and yeah probably. The fact that she never used her "reverse time on life threatening wounds" shit is pretty stupid in of itself. <br><br>But I'm pretty sure Kubo would come up with some bullshit reason like "the particles of the Quincy's attacks negate her abilities" or some other contrived concept.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah it was pretty stupid. Apparently spirits have the same physiology as humans and even obey the laws of physics, except when they don't. <br><br>I get that Kubo wants to pull off a mix between science and the supernatural but he's such a shitty writer he can't pull it off convincingly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ no. its fucking retarded to have one 8.5/10 in exchange for two 7/10's<br>Kubo has just butchered Kenny since his 'buff' he shoulda been untouchable but got fucked over by hax Gremmy</br></br>  <br> Unohana dying <br>You're going to feel real dumb in the near future.</br></br>  <br> Gets beat by nerves <br>That shit is broken as fuck.No shame in losing.<br>Nerves control your heartbeat, blood pressure, digestion, information sent from your senses to your brain, balance and general motor function.<br>Technically Pernida can fuck up your entire body and not puppeteering shit but controlling, manipulating and destroying it from the inside including what you see,hear,feel,taste and smell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just how Kira and Frenchie are not dead, right?</br>  <br>The point is that Zaraki is a retard for rushing in despite getting his arm destroyed in the blink of an eye earlier. <br><br>You'd think he'd learn after his fight with Gremmy but he's really that retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but he survived fighting god and like cut space or some shit.</br>  do you think Kubo has fun writing Bleach?  Isnt the nervious system controll litteraly the same thing?   those don't grow back you know <br>Orihime.</br>  What happened to the old other thread?<br>Deleted or died because of inactivity?</br>  <br>Mayuri learns from his mistakes, not like any other character in the series.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Only difference is that eyes arrancar actually controlled the victim, this guy just breaks them.</br>  <br>So she basically has an enhanced version of Ywach's super Blut Vene?</br>  <br>he manages the reishi currents through his nerves, and that currets are probably in the blood or some shit, so he probably did the same to the trees though their savia or some shit.</br>  <br>Well yeah. Except it follows the exact same flow.<br> Controlls Byakya/Zaraki's arm <br> Cuts nervs in arm to stop unwanteded seppuku <br> so you controll body parts huh <br>Its litteraly just abit more violent for an unnessicary reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inactivity <br>I doubt it, we have enough posts to keep one alive. Why was it deleted then?</br></br>  <br> Has been the strongest character in the series ever since then <br>Huh?</br></br>  <br><br>He's dominated every fight he's been in after his fight with Uryuu. But that's more because he knows how to pick his targets.</br></br>  <br>I think it's all part of Shunsui plan to get rid of any captain older than himself and Ukitake.<br><br>The reason? No fucking idea.</br></br></br>  if he control nerves hy not juust send nemu or some other robot to kill it  <br>It was Kubo being Kubo. He just didn't tell us that Ishida beat the strongest character in the manga.<br>I don't even care if that's not the case. I'm just gonna pretend it's foreshadowing.</br></br>  Shunshui as captain commander:<br><br> Sacrifices Unoanaha pratically for nothing. <br> Gets ready for an attack that got him by surprise even though mayuri knew it would happen. <br> Sacrificed Ukitake just to give Yawach a powerup. <br> Fres Aizen to make the rest of captains angry, so Aizen killed a bunch of minions because ther est of the captains are useless, and then leaves Aizen sitting there in his chair. <br> Invades rhe Royal Realm and forgets to bring Kenpachi with him. <br><br>if anything, i'd say Shunsui has been the best ally yawach ahs had in this war so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Nemu has nerves.</br>  FUCK YOU ALL GISELLE DIEDE?!<br><br>in other news can someone please update pic related.</br></br>  <br>So what?You're behaving like this is something new.This is fucking Zaraki.After what, 500 chapters since he debuted you call him a retard NOW?<br><br><br>Irrelevant when his opponent has a power like this.Pernida is the absolute worst possible match up for Zaraki.Someone he needs to use his brains, analyze and come up with a countermeasure.<br>With Gremmy he could just tank and rely on his power which is different from Pernida who bypasses defenses by targetting nerves which makes Zaraki's durability, his greatest asset, absolutely useless.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pernida is the absolute worst possible match up for Zaraki <br>Who fucking isn't. He has had like one good pairing.</br></br>  <br><br>Looking at this it really seems like Kubo blew his load too early in this arc.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Does Sunshui want to dstroy Soul Society? Is he workign under yawach? or with Aizen?<br>He avoided fighting with Haschwald, and now he's just bringing every shinigami to the doorspet of the main villain, knowing none of them cn do shit to hit,<br>He was OK with fighting yamamoto after destroying the soukoku and directly opossing his command.<br><br>has been killing or setting up to kill powerful/old captains.<br><br>When he entered the royal realm didn't even wondered about the royal guards or to make an alliance with them or work together to find a solution.<br><br>Freed aizen with no clear reason.<br><br>Shunsui is really fishy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For the first time ever, no captain is from the original death squad that formed the Gotei 13.</br>  <br>He definitely has fun writing Mayuri's fights</br>  <br>exactly.<br><br>And he also let ukitake die, his goodbye with him was way too cold for soemone who have been friends since 2000 years ago.</br></br></br>  <br> Frenchie <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> Mayuri has done the bulk of the successful fighting himself in this war. <br>He is the expert about them.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying trees don't have nerves?</br>  <br>there aren't any anymore. if they have conventional powers, he will stomp over them due to his immense reiatsu and a zanpakuto that cuts through anything<br><br>so he fights unconventional opponents, who wreck his shit because he's too much of an idiot to fight intelligently.</br></br></br>  <br> Freed aizen with no clear reason. <br>Obviously he wants to make him the new SK. Both he and Ukitake expected Yhwach to go to Royal Realm and took measures: Shunsui went to free Aizen, Ukitake activated Kamikake.<br>Which is why Aizen was left behind in Seireitei. Shunsui's plan will be ruined if Quincies find a way to kill Aizen.</br></br></br>   Zaraki without an arm and paralyzed <br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br>Fucking gee, so glad you gave him a power up so he could be useful, Kubo. Almost like you were about to make him an important character.</br></br>  I've just realised something. We still haven't seen Ichigo fight since he got his two swords.<br><br>I mean it's good, Ichigo fights are boring, but how long ago was that?</br></br>  <br>English Co captain</br>  <br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br><br>well mayuri decided to save him because he thinks he could be usefuul still, so I think he will still do something.</br></br></br>  <br>the only tiem he did something it was vs thunderbolt and he even told ehr to dodge because she woudl get killed otherwise.<br><br>And then he shoot one or two getsugas at yawach that did nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>He had a short fight versus T. Blew her arm off, then everybody started swarming him.</br>  <br> implying he won't pull a bankai out of his ass and then pic related will happen </br>  <br><br>What chapter was his good-bye in? I'm looking for it but I can't find it</br></br>  <br>he has no legs now.</br>  <br> arm already missing <br>Deviantart faggots knew the future all along</br></br>  <br>Lol that can't even be called a goodbye. It was in the chapter where Gotei finally arrived in SK's realm.</br>  I'm worried<br>Other than mayuri, who else could have a good fight now? Zaraki's downed, bromamura is wolfed, and even grimmjow was brought back to job.<br>The vizards are only fodder<br>And even hitsugaya's fanservice couldn't help much<br>Who else is left??</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are just broken.</br>  <br>The captain commander, Ukitake's ghost, Ichigo Squad and  Hinamori </br>  <br>Shunsui, of course. He is our last hope.</br>  <br>yawach you mean.</br>  <br><br><br>Byakuya, Renji, shunsii and I hope yoruichi</br></br></br>  <br>Shunsui<br>Urahara<br>Aizen<br>Ishiin<br>Tessai<br>Ryuuken<br>Ginjo<br>Facebook<br>Ichigo<br>Shiji if he goes bankai.<br>Byakuya new upgraded bankai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about the scene where Shunsui says "We'll save Soul Society, that's what Ukitake would've wanted."</br>  <br> Byakuya new upgraded bankai. <br>The bankai he couldn't upgrade because As Nodt had it while he was training?</br></br>  <br><br>I was talkin about the chapter where Shunsui went off to the prision and freeed aizen.</br></br>  <br>did they ever explain how johnny got out of that one? I forget if he can just stop it at will its bee so long</br>  <br>are you retarded? or just have bad memory?</br>  <br>Sounds like you have an argument to use. Show it.</br>  <br>That's the one I'm talking about too, it's the chapter that cemented for me that Shunsui is up to something</br>  Is it just me or did Mayuri just grift powers off Tousen's corpse. Fear Factor 4 is awfully similar to Suzumushi's cry.  <br>You kidding, right? Kubo would never get rid of earth nakama. Well, unless her death would conveniently make Ichigo/Ishida go berserk.</br>  <br><br><br>Found it. Chapter 605</br></br></br>  <br>of course they did.</br>    <br><br>Byakuya did the same trainign as ichigo, ruukia and renji, so he learned teh true names and all that shit of his sword.<br><br>his shikai was on his bankai level on the fight with as nodt, so his bankai WILL be different or better or whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shunsui.<br>Shuhei if he didn't literally get killed in one panel.<br>Aizen<br>Urahara</br></br></br></br>      <br> based on what was foreeeen <br><br>BY WHO<br><br>did the king gave them incompelte information on the future?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you prove that true name asspull isn't unique to Renji?<br>And his bankai couldn't have become stronger for the reason I stated earlier.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>That mofo si happy.<br><br>happy because he knows ukitake is going to die? happy because he's going to free aizen? happy because the quincies are in the royal realm?<br><br>why the fuck is Shunsui that fucking happy there?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he didn't ahd his bankai, but if he knew more about it he can improve it when he gets it back.</br>  <br><br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br><br>Not counting the fact that Mayuri is as good a healer as Unohana, Zaraki still has power boosts up his ass that'll make him ignore whatever damage he has. If the his shikai, his eyepatch.<br><br>Then again, they're fighting the Elite Sternritter who were boosted by the Aschwallen and who managed to beat the Royal Guard, why the fuck do people think they're going to be pushovers in any way?<br><br>1x1 duels are not going to happen anymore for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Since when do power-boosts regenerate arms and legs? Also, Mayuri is able to heal himself and Nemu because of the extensive body modifications he's done, he's not good at healing others.</br></br>  <br><br> he's not good at healing others. <br><br>He already healed others during the arrancar arc and he most definitely un-zombified Jizzelle's victims.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he fixed uryu and renji's internal organs.</br>  <br><br> Since when do power-boosts regenerate arms and legs? <br><br>Ludicrous amounts of reiatsu being poured tends to have bullshit healing effects.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I forgot about Uryuu and Renji. Guess he could Zaraki if he wanted to then.</br></br></br>  <br> That scene and the one directly after </br>  <br>kubo has a boner all the time</br>   Mayuri Vs. Aizen will never happen <br>This world is hell</br>  What the hell? I missed a couple of chapters. why is Mayuri fighting Zaraki?  <br>Shunsui is evil though.<br>Aizen do something pls.<br><br> Where the hell is Ryuken anyway? Not relevant anymore? </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even understand why Gremmy sent his "real" self out to fight. If he can just imagine extra selves, why would he ever not have an extra self chilling out at home? Total bullshit.<br><br> Also sick quads, pic related </br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri is a quincy, why do you think he was in the maggots nest? He only uses sceince to fight and not reiatsu like the restof the shinigami.<br><br>The clues where all there but nobody conected the dots until this reveal.</br></br></br>  The worst parts of Zaraki and Mayuri together.<br><br>Zaraki too stupid to take off his eyepatch or use Shikai after losing a fucking arm. If losing an arm doesn't name you get serious nothing will.<br><br>Mayuri magically knowing everything about his opponents abilities because he can analyze anything like he has the Sharingan and has drugs for all occasions on his person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nobody connected the dots <br>IMPLYING<br><br>it was obvious, if you werent a fucking level 1 reader</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri is the shinigami that Bruce Wayne became when he died.</br>  <br>Well, yeah, but the guy asked why they where fighting, he is clearly a level -1 reader.</br>  <br>That's entirely on character for Zaraki, and Mayuri explained exactly how he'd come to determine how Pernidas power worked using information that we the reader already had access to. Both points are entirely invalid, you shitstain.</br>  <br>Implying you arent too</br>  <br>Ryuken is a coward. Didn't show up to protect Karakura from Aizen, and he won't show up now.</br>  <br><br> Mayuri magically knowing everything about his opponents abilities <br><br>After not attacking Pernidas like an idiot and observing Zaraki getting attacked not once but twice, it's completely natural that Mayuri would start counter attacking in some way. Not that he has done much so far.<br><br>Zaraki should fucking know better at this point, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   implying mayuri knows everything about someone's power just because of a few seconds <br><br>He was surprised Ishida could use Ransentogai. Seeing quincies with schrifts should be completely foreign to him.</br></br>  <br>It's just a bad match up for Zaraki. If Miracle had shown up this situation might have been reversed.</br>  <br> implying he's even a war potential </br>  <br>you fuck off right away</br>  People always complain they hate powerlevel battles then when someone with a huge powerlevel gets wasted by someone who doesn't care about your reiatsu everyone is complaining.  <br>I'm implying no such thing. But Kubo promised us to show his bankai in this arc.</br>  <br> being retarded <br>He's seen plenty of them by this point, and they're all just applications of various reishi powers. Seeing it once and knowing what it did would be an asspull; the second time proves it's pure science.</br></br>  <br>Every schrift is completely different. You say that like they are even remotely similar. <br><br><br>the only thing any of them have in common is being granted by nazi jesus</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also we don't know how much of his power is compromised by the high Reishi density in the Warwelt</br>  <br>He wouldn't die, even if he was killed to death.<br><br>Does he even know HOW to die at all?<br><br>Yes you really need to literally know how to die in order for you to actually literally die to death, otherwise you're an infinite loop.<br><br>Trust me I know this shit.<br><br>Or do I?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes that's exactly what I implied. Are you having brain problems?</br>  <br> Overkill: super strength <br> Superstar: super strength <br> Power: super strength </br></br></br>  <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>He almost got meatball'd. He's looking like a jobber this morning, at least by /a/ standards.</br>  <br>Wasn't the Unohana fight supposed to beat the dumb out of him and return him to his brutal killer self of the past? Being a fucking 'tard kinda hinders that.</br>  <br> seeing it twice means he can know whether someone can create matter out of thin air, has zombie blood, injects people with nerves, has a love gun, is easily forgotten, or can do any other never before seen magical Quincy shit </br>  <br>E Y E P A T C H<br>E<br><br>Y<br><br>E<br><br>P<br><br>A<br><br>T<br><br>C<br><br>H</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, not even remotely. It was to release the limits he placed on himself; if anything it made him even more dumb, but also more strong. I don't know how the fuck you people didn't get that the first time, you're all level one filth.</br>  <br>It took much less for Zaraki to get serious against Ichigo. not being serious after losing an arm is not in character, it's just being regarded</br>  Reminder Zaraki will forever be at half strength due to no two handed grip on the sword.  <br>The Quincy will probably be taken out with team ups of two or more people. Grimmjow might stand up and reveals something new so don't count him out yet.<br><br>I expect Shinji to finally deliver because jesus fucking christ his character deserves some dignity back after jobbing against nonvolständig Quincy and being held of by fucking Tosen. Renji might take down that gladiator themed guy with the help of one or two others, at least I hope his fight against that Star faggot was not the last we saw in the series.<br><br><br>Shunsui might fight Haschwalth or something like that. The last cpt. commander already jobbed against Ywach so I don't expect the next to do the same mistake. Ishin and Ryuuken are bound to show up some time though I highly doubt that Tessai will show up since Kubo might have forgotten about him completely. Ginjo and the others are there to jobb. Byakuya might tagteam one of those Quincy and as will Yoruichi. Aizen, Urahara, Kenpachi, Ichigo and the fifth war potential (who the fuck? maybe Ishida that flaming faggot) will go up against Ywach.<br><br><br>Shuhei is out man, it'll be fucking bullshit if he stands up after that one. It's dumb as fuck though, what good is it to tease a bankai (even more than just once) that's never going to be revealed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're a scientist who basically made a large chunk of his early career on the study of fucking Quincy then I really shouldn't need to explain this to you. Do you even induction? Deduction? Fuck, it's not magic, it's literally just particle manipulation. And it doesn't just apply to the Quincy either. You're an absolute retard, don't bother replying.</br>  <br> implying taking off the eyepatch will protect him from hax powers or heal his wounds </br>  <br>that's bullshit anon. Just admit you have forgotten that he did not have his bankai. He might have gotten physically stronger but no new bankai for him.</br>  <br>Zaraki's entire purpose of being there with Mayuri is to boost Mayuri's wow-thats-so-fucking-cool factor. Kubo is simply playing favorites with a captain we have limited information about. Remember Zaraki's fight with the sternritter imagination? Same stuff.</br>  <br>That was pre-awakened Kenpachi. Just saying.</br>  <br>There is literally nothing he can deduce from just seeing these powers twice<br><br>Like nothing about watching the V- Vanish would tell you he was manifested by someone with imagination powers or that Superstar was a puppet body for james.</br></br></br>  <br> implying limitless reiatsu pressure wouldn't suppress any quincy power </br>  <br>Except it's literal fucking magic you stupid twat. The bleach universe doesn't even have a set of rules to follow to accurately deduct anything when it comes to power-levels. Kubo going "b-but he's a scientist!" is just a shitty cop-out.</br>  <br>fagit</br>  <br>No I'm pretty sure you're just a retard. <br> quincy can pump reishi through the body <br> Pernidas attack removes control of Kenpachi motor control, arm contorts of its own volition <br> uses paralysis on kenpachi- tests hypothesis  <br>It's the scientific method. It's barely even an ability, it's just logical reasoning.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for level -1 reading. Go back and start from chapter one, you clearly missed something important.</br>  <br> quincy can control and pump reishi <br> instead of using nerves it's some sort of pseudo telekinesis <br> mayuri just paralyzed their greatest asset for some shitty guess <br><br>Hell there is nothing there that lets you know it was nerve control and not mind control or any of the other various stern ritter powers we saw.<br><br>The V-Visionary should be able to do the samething pernida does without any of the nerve shit. Then mayuri would be looking like an idiot.<br><br>There is no way to tell what's going on or the opponent's power is with just sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean the trees that were grown from one of the Royal Guard's body?

Just like Hime.    I have a question /pc/:<br><br>Would you support next year's All Stars movie being done entirely in CGI if it meant that every Cure would have a speaking role?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Watching Haru no Carnival made really pissed with all those silent Cures.</br>  <br> I thought having Nagisa address Hikari only to have her cut off my Mepple was cold, but hilarious </br>  <br>yes if they made it movie length (90 minutes or more) as even in the early all stars the older Cures didn't get many lines.</br>  <br>Every cure having a decent role in a short film is a pipe dream at this point. There are just too many of them any more and lots of them probably don't even want to be voicing cures forever.</br>  <br>Only if it will have good combat scenes. I love first All Stars DX.</br>  <br>I think that's more important to me than them even speaking to be honest. If they could all get some love in the fight animation aspect, I wouldn't mind a lack of voices much.</br>  <br>I don't really care about it. Give me good hand-to-hand combat and beamspam against lots of giant enemies.</br>  <br>I just wish other groups got as much love from the animators/storyboarders as Nagisa and Honoka do for instance.</br>  <br>They managed to get all of them back last year for the 10th anniversary, I'm fairly certain most if not all of them would accept coming back one last time if it was exactly that, one last time.<br><br>Basically go out with one last All Stars movie, giving every cure screen time and speaking roles, and then end it with all the cure's except the current team saying their final farewells. From that point on every year is the current team and the team before it.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe like a few teams even, but yeah ALL of them is just getting to be too much. My favorite group is the Max Hearts, so you know, I tend to get a lot of fanservice, but even still I think it would be best if they limit it to a few groups per movie, probably the current and two before or something. Maybe do another ALL of em crossover when they get to 100 cures or something, assuming everyone is still alive.</br>  <br> From that point on every year is the current team and the team before it. <br>I'm conflicted about this. On one side, this is undoubtly better, both for the writing and the budget. But on the other side, how else could I see Nagisa and Honoka being awesome, hearing Tsubomi's lovely voice, and watching Erika being Erika again?</br></br>  <br> hearing Tsubomi's lovely voice <br><br>Imagine being the person having to break the news to Mizuki Nana</br></br></br>  <br>I hope they become best friends and partake many wacky shenanigans and copious amounts of screentime.</br>  <br>Isn't she really famous though? Probably just being able to put her name on posters helps sell tickets. I'd bet she shows up in crossover movies until she literally can't anymore for physical reasons like being dead.</br>    was this typeset?    Usually I'm a real sucker for girls who are good with kids. I fall for kindergarten teachers all the time. But Nao never really played this angle up much outside of a couple moments and presumably the rest of this focus episode, huh? Too bad. It's already super cute.  December webshop exclusive.  <br>The only angle Smile cures played up was their retardation. Outside the single character episode they got near the end.</br>  Well this was kind of unexpected, but pretty funny. I thought they'd magic themselves some music skills but I guess they just pretended.  <br>Why did Sailor Moon get 2 figures?</br>  <br> creating merch for fan cures <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>She has 4, actually.</br>  <br>This look isn't too bad for Doremi either.</br>  <br>Did they just pretend that? I haven't seen it in a while, but I know the voice actors formed an idol unit called Maho-dou while the series aired, so I thought it was meant that the ojamajos actually could play as a band. It's shown that Hazuki does play violin, and Doremi does play piano anyway. Also, Onpu sings and Ako plays harmonica at least. They're different instruments sure, but I used to play sax in school and making the jump to my little brother's keyboard was easy enough and after school I picked up guitar because saxophones were too expensive. <br><br><br>Doremi is super cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This mother fucker.<br><br><br>They pretended to play to a karaoke background.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Sailor Moon in that picture is actually Nephrite (a villain from season 1) in disguise as Sailor Moon - which I find to be kind of a waste of a figure, since he only wore that disguise in one episode. I'd rather have a Naru figure.</br>  <br>I want her mankai manko.</br>    <br>Zoisite. Nephrite was the dude.<br><br> I think. Haven't seen it since I was a babby. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm boring. I like all the ships Toei actually pushes and don't really care about much else. Nagisa x FujiP made for ADORABLE Nagisa moments. Hime's little crush on Seiji was adorable too, but then the date with Megumi was even better for me.</br>  <br>Ah. ANd here I thought the face was just fucked up as a shoutout to Crystal or something. Clearly I know nothing about sailor moon, but that's actually kind of cool they'd make a figure for something like that. I hope Precure will get the same treatment in another 10 years.</br>  <br>Zoisite is a dude too. They just made him female for the dub.</br>  <br>Well shit.</br>  <br> that's actually kind of cool they'd make a figure for something like that <br>No it's not, they're only doing it because it's cheaper to re-use the same figure with different colors and face decals than to make something new.</br></br>  <br>And the same with Fisheye</br>  Cure Sunshine would have been much better if she didn't have the long hair,.  <br>Oh, but you're so wrong.</br>    <br>If you mean every cure except Rin, sure</br>  <br>Something like gdgd Fairies? Sure.</br>  <br>That reminds me I need to watch the second season of this. The first was wonderful.</br>  <br>I also wish Minarai Diva was subbed.</br>  <br> From that point on every year is the current team and the team before it. <br>I don't see why people think this would somehow be good. Look at New Stage 1. <br><br>The other Cures only appear in the opening montage and then near the end of the final battle, and yet it was one of the worst All Star Movies, in spite of the Smiles and Suite being the only Cures around during 80% of the movie.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Haruyama makes Kirara like 50 times more sexual than she already is, it's a dangerous amount of sasuga to be able to make</br>  <br>I'm surprised that Kirara's hand isn't on Towa's butt.</br>  <br>There is usually a contract that the company needs to use the current seiyuu for future representative for the same character regardless the excuses (i.e:Aya Hirano for Haruhi). If you want to have all the voices, you need to pay all the precure seiyuu. Note: there is a minimum sum for a contract (union things), it doesn't mean the company can pay very little if the line is short. Now, you can imagine the cost if all precures have their own voice</br>  Why do you guys watch a magical girl show    There is unrest in the forest<br>There is trouble with the cures<br>For the purples want more screentime<br>and the pinks ignore their pleas.</br></br></br>  Wait... we have forgotten one thing.<br>How could other students not notice Towa's elf ears?</br>  <br>Because?</br>  <br><br>Isn't it usually hidden behind her hair?</br></br>  <br>Kirara clearly understands what is to be done with elves.</br>  <br>I'm afraid I don't understand the question.</br>  <br><br>I don't know anymore. I remember hearing this <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yMz<wbr>ce2Mq0js</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>And felt warm feelings towards it once and now I lost it.

Also, it's cute and fun.</br>  I want her  <br>For le what? Good thing I didn't pay attention to French in high school. Why did I even pick French when German was an option? Never thought it would come in useful watching subtitled chinese cartoons though.</br>  <br>Only if you like Commie sub</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm really regretting using them, but not enough to bother redownloading episodes. <br><br>What's a "Despairvil" supposed to be anyway.<br><br>All of this is a distraction from the more important topic of how much I want to fuck a french cat.</br></br></br></br></br>  The only reason why Kirara does not want Pafu to dress Towa is that she wants to strip Towa by herself  <br>A very sad one? But no, that is actually more important, I agree. I also would nyani her until she was sore.</br>  <br>WE'LL NEVER GET TO SEE THE ADVENTURES OF TAIYOMAN</br>  <br> I want to fuck a french cat <br><br/></br></br>    <br>When's the last time her human form appeared, I'm getting withdrawal symptoms over here.</br>  <br> Why did I even pick French when German was an option? <br>Why would you pick either unpopular language when Spanish or Portuguese would take you to much more interesting places, with more sunshine?<br><br>Picture related, it's sunshine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like brown people, or warm weather.</br>  <br>Why would you pick any language other than superior Nihonese?</br>  <br> I don't like brown people, or warm weather. <br> 90° in Berlin. <br> Germany is full of Arabs. <br>You are too dumb to live.<br><br><br>That's a good question.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. You may have noticed already but Smile staff didn't really care much about Nao. They strung her around doing little things here and there but never nothing substantial unlike everyone else until the very last end where it's far way too late for you to start caring. And even that episode clearly has less budget and effort on it in comparison to everyone's else episodes.<br><br>My theory is that the staff didn't treat Nao as well as everyone else on purpose because they did not want to overshadow their obvious favorite in Akane because "durr they are both tomboys hurr" like so many idiots here on /pc/ also parrot.</br></br></br>  <br>Man you fucked up because the strongest sandniggerland places in yurop are France and the UK.<br><br>Also, Spain is a shit. It's the ass of Europe and Spainiards are the spics of it.</br></br></br>  <br>The things i would do to Miss Shamour.</br>  <br>I thought the Slavlands/Russia were the ass of Europe.<br><br>I guess Europe can have two asses.</br></br></br>    <br>France isn't any better off.</br>  Oi, I didn't want to choose a language based on wanting to go to that place. German just sounds cool. French sounds fucking gay.<br><br><br>The cutest Dalek ever.</br></br></br>  <br>France and Germany are both fine.<br><br>YOU are fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Megumi looks like she was drawn by  Tom Preston  there.</br></br>  <br>Okay now, that reminds me of something only very tangentially related, but does anyone remember some Toei Phil animator having a breakdown on social media about criticism of Crystal's art? I was trying to find that earlier and couldn't get the right combination of keywords I guess. I swear it's in the archive somewhere though.</br>    <br>http://moritatakahiro-waifuuuu.tumb<wbr>lr.com/</wbr></br>  <br>Yes, that's the one. Thank you, anon.</br>  <br><br>Crystal's animation was shit, but Jesus Christ crystalquality is an autistic fuck.</br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br>  <br>Would anime even exist, if it weren't for autistic fuckwads like that loser? He's clearly deeply invested in his favorite franchise.</br>  Will we ever get another swimsuit?  <br>On a villain? Sure.</br>  <br>We're going to have another beach episode soon, we might even see Towa in one</br>  <br>We'll definitely see Puff and Aroma in one.</br>  <br>I've been enchanted with the concept of mahou shoujo ever since I discovered Sailor Moon was a thing. I couldn't honestly tell you what it is that makes me like it so much; my best guess would be that a lot of magic girl series have a sense of the absurd to them that really appeals to me.</br>  <br>Kind of makes me wish I were a buyfag. I have a real soft spot for Ayumi.</br>  <br>I have a hard spot for her.</br>  Would you play Twister with Yayoi?  <br>I did notice that actually. And I didn't like this episode as much. Very rarely in precure the bad guys go too far for me to enjoy myself. I start to feel actually troubled instead of just excited you know? Made me cry when I saw Nao's face here. Those eyes, man. It's all my fault, I shouldn't have deflected it! One thousand years later, it gets blocked. Even though I know its going to work out because it's a kids show, it's a bit too much for me when they do things like this.

The Early Stone Age in Africa is equivalent to what is called the Lower Paleolithic in Europe and Asia. <br> The oldest stone tools, known as the Oldowan toolkit, consist of at least: <br> (...) <br> • Sharp stone flakes that were struck from the cores and offer useful cutting edges, along with lots of debris from the process of percussion flaking  <br>That said, depiction of Japanese women in Ukiyo-E paintings show that while they could shave, it was still considered socially acceptable not to.

So this is just gonna be a fucking flashback episode, huh? Guess we'll have to wait for next week for the bathroom scene.    <br>I don't understand <br>I keep refreshing it but it just says the channel is currently offline.</br></br>   Anime original content <br><br>For what purpose<br>How far is this adaption going to reach</br></br></br>    <br>Should have really expected that when it's titled "Back Then" or whatever.</br>  <br>Thank you based spoonfeeder</br>   megu-nee episode <br>What a waste of ep3. They should have delivered the exciting parts as soon as possible.<br>That's why it will fail.</br></br>    <br> Complaining about the anime expanding on canon </br>  <br>Some channels are fucked up like that, no idea why. Maybe it limit viewers.</br>  Oh snap it's this moment  All that blur.  Did the bathroom scene not happen?    <br>They better still do graduation. I'm fine with anime original content, but not at the expense of the best manga scenes. <br><br>They'll still have room if they cut out the mall, but I'm starting to think that between the Kurumi being bit arc, whatever they're gonna do with the dog, and a potential mall flashback they won't have room for helicopter of graduation.</br></br></br>    <br>This episode is just a flashback to z-day told from Megu-nee's perspective. Expect bathroom next week.</br>  rip stream  <br>It's not entirely anime original though, is it? I mean they didn't show anything in the manga, but I remember a few lines about when this happened.</br>  <br><br>Thus it came to pass.</br></br>  <br>That was just the first half though. Bathroom might be in the second half, would make sense to make the first part Megu-nee centered.</br>    <br>This ep is chapter 4 + a flashback to the outbreak it seems. It kinda fits though. They're expanding a lot on Megu-nee's character for next episode, at this pace though they won't make it to graduation for sure.</br>  Rip GG.<br>The anime will fail hard. Because they didn't deliver that basement arc in ep 3.</br>  Fuck this shit.  <br>Who would kill the stream. CC allows anime, only thing that could happen is this thread could be deleted for advertising/</br>  that bedroom eyes  <br> Because they didn't deliver that basement arc in ep 3. <br>You want them to adapt the basement arc now? That wouldn't fit at all with the pacing and would be sorely out of place without developing all the characters first.</br></br>  Screen getting distorted big time.  Are we going to do this every single episode?<br><br> WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH </br></br>  gay  <br>It's your delusions breaking.<br>The stream never existed.</br></br>  <br>Is this your first day on /a/ faggot?</br>  Wasn't a terrible episode, but was kinda lackluster. I appreciate the expanded setting though.  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH  <br>so yuriii!</br>  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH   Kei in the preview <br>wat</br>  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH  Next week is fucking Kei.<br>They're not gonna show the bathroom scene till episode 6 at this fucking rate.<br><br>GG GG</br></br></br>    <br>The viewers wanted to see it delivered in this ep.<br>It doesn't sell as is so they needed to do something about it.<br>Now many people will just drop it and bam it will fail the sales.</br></br></br>  They really want this series to flop, don't they?  The first half was extremely boring and unnecessary. Why even cut out plot parts if you're replace them with this shit.<br>At least we got a bloody shovel this time, I guess.</br>  <br>MIKI A BEST</br>  It was alright. I think I've become too accustomed to episode 3 of any given manga being the episode where they drop the hammer.<br><br>It's pretty clear they did this episode to make it  seem like Megu-nee is actually alive.  If they did the twist this episode, it wouldn't have as much impact for anime-only watchers as it would now.<br><br>KEI NEXT EPISODE (wait, what)</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded</br>  <br>Still best girl</br>  <br> no neet comments about the zombie apocalypse flying through the screen </br>  <br> any given manga <br><br>Anime, obviously. Are we actually getting the mall episode next week? Flashbacks on top of flashbacks would be a bit too much I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's see anon<br>Be sure to be here when the sales data is released</br></br>  SHUT THE FUCK UP FAGGOTS, Gakkou is still AOTS stop hating on new things that develop the setting more  Bathroom + Kei flashback next episode.<br><br>Mark my words.</br></br>  <br>That's Youtube.</br>    <br>There may not be mall anymore.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> getting this buttflustered that manga fans are comparing the adaptation to the source material <br>Go back to reddit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you fuck off back to MAL or whatever</br>  <br>Seems like too much for a single episode. I have no idea how they're planning on going with the show at this pace. I don't dislike it though, in fact I thought animating the rooftop scene was very nice.</br>  <br>Thank you anon!</br>  The last scene had Megunee writing in the basement. Must find it earlier in this adaptation.<br><br>They're shuffling things around enough that mangafags won't be bored with a straight adaptation at least.</br></br>  <br>"It's different, therefore bad." is not a criticism that should ever be entertained.</br>  <br>Anime original end, the heli gonna rescue them.</br>  <br>It should just have followed the manga<br>It's always like this when they mess with something just werks and fuck up it hard.<br>You knoe no one gives a fuck about megu-nee or her relationships with her students<br>People were in it for the suffering and it didn't deliver it at ep 3.<br>Also they fucked up Kurumi's character quite a bit by making her butchering the senpai just like that.<br>What a disappointment.<br><br>FUCKING DROPPED</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So It's confirmed that before the outbreak happened, Yuki was bullied and depressed. Adds a lot more weight to some things in the manga such as Yuki commenting how bullies are bad.<br><br>I'm calling it right here, Yuki will be the one to save the school life club by using past rage/stress from bullying after seeing the uni girls/bikers 'bully' the club, drawing first human blood.</br></br>  So are thy gonna just skip Miki's character arc? I know she isn't the most relevant one of the main four but still, she's a cute character.  <br>Well, if the scene with Megu writing in the basement was based on this moment here, then bathroom is pretty much right after that.</br>  <br> this entire post </br>  At least we know now how sempai got into the roof with them.<br><br>If it was a 1:1 adaptation we'd never know.<br><br>Think about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe there is a small change that this will be one of those split cours. They usually don't announce this from the very beginning. I don't know how much manga material there is, though.</br>  <br>No one is bored watching the shit even if it's 1:1 adaptation source material.<br>It's like you don't know anything about the animefags</br></br>  <br>If my opinion as a mangafag was relevant for the author, I'd have prefered to be a straight adaptation considering wha he has done so far. I don't know he thinks what he has done so far was a good idea, but hopefully the sale will give him a hint.</br>  <br>Did you even watch the fucking preview?</br>  <br>Maybe because this isn't a straight adaptation we'll find out how Megu-nee got infected.</br>  <br>You mean the sales of the manga that have more than doubled after an almost entirely anime original first episode?<br><br>Yeah, maybe that was a big hint for him.</br></br></br>  All the changes aren't all that bad. I just hope they don't fuck up pic related.  <br>No, the anime sales.</br>  <br>I don't come from anywhere else though anon.<br><br>People haven't been saying it's bad because it's different though. You sound like one of those retards that think any criticism is shitting on something</br></br></br>  <br>You know that the anime sales are barely relevant so long as the manga gets a big boost (which it has), right?</br>  <br>Yes it is. Changes are always bad and should never be accepted.</br>  If this anime aired 10-12 years ago then people would like the changes, because of the novelty it delivers I think but now it is no more the case.<br>The changes are triggering the people.<br>And tbh they are a bit not good...</br></br>  <br>I'm aware, but I can see how this is going to be irrelevant to the nips as soon as the anime ends, and therefore the manga sales will come back to usual.</br>  <br> And tbh they are a bit not good... <br>Is English your first language?</br></br>  <br> tbh <br>Nice meme.</br></br>   I don't really like the small changes they put into the anime but it is still watchable. The manga is still better but I'd continue to watch the anime nonetheless because I got nothing else better to do; just an opinion of mine. <br><br>Any changes to the opening? I missed it.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting mangafag.</br>  <br>It could also be that the anime will sell good. You usually don't see high pre-order numbers during the first weeks unless it is some really big hype like Fate stuff or something. Barely anybody even knew GG before so it will take a time until people start consider buying this and they'll probably wait anyway to see how well the adaption works. Maybe it will rise when the important/suffer scenes will happen in the upcoming episodes.</br>  muh subs when?  <br>Well it wasn't Taroumaru since they still have him.</br>  <br>There'll be about 40 chapters out when the anime ends, but the best stopping point is in chapter 30, so we'd need a snail's pace and lots of original content to adapt less than 2 chapters per episode for it to last that long. Which is exactly what is happening right now, so you might be on to something.<br><br> split cour <br> second half airs in winter <br> ends at graduation <br> by that time there's almost enough material out for another cour <br>A man can dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far as I see barely anyone even complains about the changes themselves. Most anons only fear the shortness of the anime (one cours) and that they won't be able to adapt the important stuff that happens later.</br>  <br>I'm not saying it won't sell well, it's just that it won't be a big deal if/when it doesn't because it's already a success at what it was made for.<br><br>It's not as if it's an anime original that's relying on anime sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Reason for spoiler tag.</br>  <br>There's much more animefags than mangafags.<br><br>Deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br>7am PDT</br>  <br>The sales won't go back to "normal", people who bought 6 volumes won't stop there just because the anime is over.</br>  <br>They'll have to deal with Zombiemaru now that Megu-nee isn't alive when he turns.</br>  I don't get why people hate the changes.<br>Why would I want to see the exact same thing I already read? It's not like seeing it animated will make the story any better. In fact, considering the animation, it would only make the anime guaranteed to be worse than the manga. At least, even if it turns out worse than the managa, you won't be bored seeing the exact same thing you already read.</br>  Doujin of cute girls raped by zombies before getting eaten when?  <br><br>I wonder if the author left some bits out expecting it to become an anime at some point. It would give new material for people to look forward to.<br><br>Or maybe just stuff that couldn't get into the manga because time and page constraints.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because i want to see the story in manga animated not some other original one.</br>  <br>People hate changes when they're for the worse, like fucking up the atmosphere of Kurumi's "good night" to the zombie, skipping all the blood and gore and sad depressed atmosphere so far.</br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> Blood and gore <br> Gore <br><br>Give me one panel of on page gore. Actual gore.<br><br><br>It's literally being written by the mangaka. If this was a bonus chapter, you wouldn't be complaining about it, so what's the issue when it's animated?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The original content has been meh so far, I'd even call it boring.</br>  <br>You don't want this anon.</br>  https://archive.moe/a/thread/110038<wbr>396/#110038641<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/109993<wbr>809/<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112097<wbr>001/<br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br>http://pastebin.com/6HyJahXx<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128388<wbr>151/#128412672<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/e<wbr>xtras%20pastebin<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/q<wbr>wd0m6unfm1gnib/Gakkou+Gurashi+extra<wbr>s+V1.zip<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/u<wbr>o9j2u3b6r9lsrb/Gakkou_Gurashi_v4_bo<wbr>nus.zip<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/9<wbr>g5r6cj0ofsh0dh/GG+School+map.zip<br><br>What am I missing?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br>Also why did they fuck up Yuki's scene in the library?<br>You know, the one when even the illusionary Megu-Nee leaves and we see how the happy-go-lucky is actually trembling in a corner.</br></br>  <br> I don't get why people hate the changes <br>Because we want our favorite scenes animated and not random something, duh.</br></br>  <br>Sometimes when authors have too much freedom they fuck up their own stories.</br>  <br>I suppose you would know best then, instead of the author.</br>  <br> what's the issue when it's animated? <br>I don't have an issue with the content itself, my concern is that the show only has a limited amount of time to work with, and I'm worried about what will get sacrificed for the original content. Hopefully it works out.</br></br>  <br>They want to keep her from PTSD a little more</br>  I don't know why some people think there won't be a graduation, it's the perfect stopping point even if they're not thinking in producing a 2nd cour/season.<br><br>They might shorten some stuff before but there's no way they won't be ending the anime with that.</br></br>  <br>This, just look at that fucking hack of George Lucas.</br>  <br><br>That's why they have editors.</br></br>  <br><br> People hate changes when they're for the worse <br>No, they hate it when it changes or removes the scenes they were waiting for, regardless of how the actual changes were made. Not saying it isn't a legit reason to be upset, just that the quality of the new content doesn't factor into it.<br><br> Kurumi's "good night" to the zombie <br>The only new content that bothered me, besides Miki being there from the start. Everything else is fitting in well, and today's was a solid exposition and build-up episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> skipping all the blood and gore <br>Shouldn't you be shitposting in a GATE thread?</br></br>  Someone pointed it out above, but I don't think people got the message. The anime needs a good stopping point, and the only good one is chapter 30.<br><br>It may seem like that's a lot of chapters to adapt, but the manga is actually surprisingly sparse in serious plot content between chapter 1 and 30, certainly not enough for a properly paced 1:1 adaptation over 12-13 episodes. For example, the entire Mall arc is 6 chapters, but can easily be done in a single episode.<br><br>So, you either get anime original content or a 1:1 at a snail's pace. I'd much rather have the former.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lolwut?</br>  <br> Lolwut? <br>Go back to the shithole you came from.</br></br>  <br> I am so dense, I can't understand how scared she is even though she's fucking pissing herself while someone is protecting her. </br>  <br>The manga portrayed that scene way better in terms of atmosphere and showing how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up. Having Megu-nee there reassuring her through it all ruins the whole thing.</br>  <br>You make me, buddy</br>   Symbolism <br><br>bravo vince</br></br>  <br><br>You know 30/13 means approximately 2 chapters per episode<br>They could fucking adapt it easily.</br></br></br>  <br> how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up <br>She never realizes it in that scene. The entire time she thinks it's a ghost from the trial of courage.</br></br>  <br>Megu being dead is already obvious. The anime isn't hiding it. The fact that you see her clinging to someone that is not there to protect her is much worse.</br>  <br>I agree, but there's no way to know whether it will work out until the show's over.<br><br>Relevant content wise, there's the mall and Miki/Kei's backstory, Megu-nee and the bathroom scene, the whole basement and infected Kurumi arc, helicopter, and graduation. Anything else I'm forgetting?</br></br></br>  <br>But they aren't. After episode 3 they've adapted 4 chapters.</br>  <br> 2 chapters an episode <br><br>The chapters are really short for a monthly manga.</br></br></br>  <br> Miki/Kei <br>1 Episode<br><br> Megu-nee bathroom <br>1 <br><br> Infected Kurumi <br>2 (3 an absolute limit)<br><br> Helicopter <br>1-2<br><br> Graduation <br>1<br><br>That's 8 episodes maximum. Add that to what we've already done and we still don't even make it to 12.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She always knew deep down, her facade and playing delusional only pushed it away so much but it was always there in some way<br><br>Not my point, so what?</br></br></br>  <br> The manga portrayed that scene way better in terms of atmosphere and showing how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up. <br><br>How is it not your point?</br></br></br>  <br><br>What I was talking about that they could have adapted it to anime easily in 1:1 sense. They could add extra scenes without changing shit much as well.</br></br>  <br>It isn't. I didn't say a thing about Megunee being dead or anything or how audience understands she's really not there. It's not as obvious as the manga.</br>  <br>Are you serious right now? You are complaining because it isn't obvious? Do you want a mexican soap opera camera zoom-in to character's faces to know what they feel?</br>  The anime is making Megu-nee more of a character at the expense of others because it's going to actually have an ending to the story earlier on, so Megu-nee obviously has to be more prominent.<br><br>I thought this was obvious</br></br>  <br>Miki one on one real talk with Yuki, but that's also short and could even be done in the same episode as the mall flashback. Though that itself might take 2 episodes, especially if they keep Kurumi's visit to her home and take their time with scenes including Kei.</br>  I just want more transltaions of the manga  <br>There's nothing to translate until tomorrow, calm your tits.</br>  Best girl of season.  wait a minute  When's Shovel gonna go bonkers and stop fighting because she thinks the shovel is senpai?  <br>Megu-nee also had the bear on her rear view mirror.</br>  <br>Miikun shouldn't exist yet.<br> Kill it with fire </br></br>  <br>What's Ruu doing there?</br>  <br>What am I waiting for?</br>  <br>The next episode.</br>  <br>Kurumi is love<br>Kurumi is life</br></br>  <br>Next manga chapter</br>  <br>You cheeky cunt.</br>  <br>Ayaya looks like she's not wearing pants at all.</br>    <br>Ruu doesn't wear a pink ribbon</br>  <br><br>I don't know, you should kill yourself right now.</br></br>  <br>Flinging shit isn't gonna help further your argument.</br>   feel when just watched the raw and understood everything <br><br>guess not having to wait for subs is cool.<br>starting to see the fruits of my study</br></br></br>  <br>Subscribed</br>  I'm really afraid they'll go for an anime original end where Yuki is the only survivor and gets picked up by Helicopter-kun at the end.<br><br>Please don't make it happen.</br></br>  <br> Megu-nee  will be the only survivor.</br>  <br>Yes I do<br><br> zombie cum inside Kurumi <br> girls save Kurumi before zombie takes a bite out of her <br> by time the girls check if Kurumi is okay, she turn into a perverted lesbian zombie and sexually assaults the girls </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That'd only happen if it was adapted by Bones.</br>  <br>Twist: It's all in Megu-nee's head.</br>   [HorribleSubs] Gakkou Gurashi! - 03 [720p].mkv     <br>Shovel is already a zombie though.</br>  <br> perverted lesbian futa zombie <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br> everything is just a never ending chain of delusions <br> the person who is behind all of the delusions at the end   is the viewer </br></br>  <br>She's holed up in the basement bunker alone, imagining what it would be like if she had saved the others.<br>Her weak presence in the club is due to her being unable to properly associate herself with them, even in her mind, not after what she did.</br></br>  <br> season ends <br> finish watching the last episode <br> look outside window <br> zombies everywhere <br> check /a/ <br> the last post was made at the start of the season </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying there wouldn't be zombies shitposting daily because that's what they remember doing </br>    <br>That's why in her delusions she views herself as a zombie.</br>  So, do the zombies eat people or just bite them?<br>If they are hungry, it would make more sense to eat them, but they just seem to want to bite.</br>  <br>Can zombies solve captchas?</br>   pretty much every thread is filled with mostly mangafags, constantly comparing the manga to the anime.

It has a darker tone than DM but it has all the crazy ancient civilization motif. Just so you know, card games has been combined with motor sports and alot of people find it awesome.</br>  <br>Just started 5Ds a few days ago myself, on episode 10 and I'm really enjoying it</br>  <br>Arc-V does not capture the spirit of 5Ds with the riding duels.

If they wanted to bring back fucking card games on motorcycles, they shouldn't have done away with speed counters, speed spells, and fucking Speed World upgrade. Seriously, we could have done without Synchro being basically fucking Neo Domino. And we could have done without Jack and Crow being there.<br><br><br>Search the archive.

Its the same as when everyone kept thinking she'd learn XYZ</br>  <br>They would obviously take at least a minute to show Sawatari's face contorting in terror at the realization he is about to lose to a child.</br>  <br>I fear Yuzu won't go beyond Fusion and Pendulum at this rate. If they were going to have her Synchro, this arc would've been perfect set up to show her practicing it with Yugo before the Friendship Cup.</br>  Let'sall ENJOY<br><br>KOI KOI KOI KOI <br>KOI KOI KOI KOI</br></br></br>  <br>People have been thinking Yuzu is "just about" to learn syncro for ages*</br>  I've been watching Zexal because it's the only YGO series that I haven't seen and holy fucking shit is it awful. Yuma does something good but resets to complete idiot by the next episode. Only 2 duels have got me hype so far because the action is lacking.  Isn't Sawatari vsing Yuzu in the Friendship Cup??  <br>I guess we'll have to wait for her next duel to see:^)</br>  how do you feel about dub names?<br>rate them:<br>gongenzaka&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gong  I like it <br>yuzu hiragi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;zuzu boyle  retarded <br>kurosaki shun&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shay  could be better, could be worse <br>sawatari shingo&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Silvio I like it <br>LDS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LID(leo institute of dueling) feels kinda pointless, but both names are good <br>akaba reiji&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Declan  I like it. gives a mature name that relates to english speakers. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't confirmed</br>  <br>Just a rumor.</br>  <br>lying and editing neo new sawatari's win/lose ratio is not ok anon. don't do that.</br>  <br>If she does learn it, it won't be before Yuya.<br><br>Yuya will probably use Synchro on his R1 opponent.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad Reira is getting mindraped by some jean lackey<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hwN<wbr>dAXkc8Kg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>yuma's a fucking idiot that can't duel for the first couple arcs. by the finals of the heartland cup he actually learns how to play, and ZEXAL II is a lot better.<br><br><br>I think he'll use it in his rematch vs jack, and he'll use the tuner jack gave the kid. as for yuzu, I wouldn't be surprised if she picks up synchro summoning before the finals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll use pendulum synchro against Jack to go even further beyond so he needs to learn synchro sooner</br>  <br> S-She is going to learn Xyz from Shun <br> Tfw they never interacted again after episode 21 </br></br>   Yuzu <br> Dueling ever <br>lmao she's going to job first round then become yuya.wav for the rest of the series</br></br>  <br>I can see him doing some form of Synchro.v2 in his rematch vs jack. <br>And for that to happen he has to use normal Synchro before duelling Jack again. Like how Yuya used Dark Rebellion a lot before going full OERD.</br></br>  <br>he learned pendulum fusion in one duel, why not pendulum synchro?</br>  <br>God I hope not</br>  <br>You can't damage whats already broken. Reira will eye rape them in return. <br><br>Why did they give Ruka such a good theme. It's almost criminal.</br></br></br>  PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM<br>PENDUALUM</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, she's been shown to be actually competent at dueling, I doubt they'd shaft her like that.</br>  <br> I wouldn't be surprised if she picks up synchro summoning before the finals <br>No way would they detract from the uniqueness of Yuya mastering syncro in addition to fusion by having Yuzu do it first. Yuzu was getting fusion lessons from Sora, and Yuya still did it first. But I dont think they'll have another of of the Lancers (who isnt a villian) besides Yuya and Reiji do multiple summoning methods<br><br><br>People overrated how many shits Shun gives about non Ruri Ruris</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No way would they detract from the uniqueness of Yuya mastering syncro in addition to fusion by having Yuzu do it first </br>  Yuya is going to  PENDULUM ACCEL SYNCHRO  during his duel against Jack  <br>I have a brother called Declan, he fucking sucks at Yugioh, we laugh about this all the time.</br>  <br> Dueling Jack again <br>It would be pointless and a waste of time.</br></br>  <br>Alright, during the Fusion invasion then</br>  <br>He got fucked by Jack the first time, he needs to beat him</br>  <br> He got fucked by Jack the first time, he needs to beat him <br><br>Not that anon you responded to but no, Yuya doesn't "need" to beat Jack. By that logic, Yuma needed to beat Kaito. If anything, Jack will get BTFO and carded by Yuri to hype Yuri up as being ridiculously good, only for Yuya to beat Yuri when the Lancers go to Academia. So by beating the person who carded Jack, it is kinda like defeating Jack himself. Since it would show that Yuya has surpassed Jack.<br><br>Just like how Yuya indirectly proved he was stronger than Shun by basically defeating Sora in their rematch. Then again, YGO is cliche as fuck when it comes to the protagonist losing only to win in a rematch.<br><br>Yugi's real losses were Pegasus, Kaiba (Duelist Kingdom), and Rafael in that order. Yugi beat all of them in the rematch. Judai beat Ryo and Edo in their rematches (well tied with Ryo, but Judai didn't lose), and never got to duel Kaibaman because he was filler so it didn't matter. Yusei lost to Jack (off-screen) and Kiryu but beat both of them in the rematch. Yuma beat everyone in a rematch who he lost to, except Kaito (although their last duel was the only one Yuma actually lost, even if he would have lost the first duel too).<br><br>If Yuya duels Jack again it would be stupid since the plot LITERALLY demands that Yuya win because the YGO protagonists tend to beat the person they lost to in a rematch. What point would there be if we already know Yuya would win because plot?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gonna be curious, do you have a cosplay for your favourite monster? It could be anything, from your cardfu to an eldritch abomination, and don't say me that there can't be a cosplay for a dragon, unrelated to topic I saw a very tall man doing a perfect cosplay of Dukemon, so if that is possible then even a Stardust Dragon is too. Just don't use Dark Magician Girl, it's already too used.  <br> By that logic, Yuma needed to beat Kaito <br>Yuma never really strongly cared about showing he was better than Kaito (he never really did actually, Kaito never lost any match without bullshit involved). He just wanted to be friends with him. Yuya and Jack is different, Jack destroyed the entertainment duel Yuya base himself around, he wants to prove it isnt just self satisfaction directly to Jack.<br><br> If Yuya duels Jack again it would be stupid since the plot LITERALLY demands that Yuya win because the YGO protagonists tend to beat the person they lost to in a rematch <br>Its not really cliche so much as basic storytelling. Have the protag lose the first fight for a stated reason, set up a rematch for the future, have the protag develop in the lead up to it in response to the reason, then have him overcome his foe at the climax<br><br> What point would there be if we already know Yuya would win because plot? <br>What point was there in Yuya fighting Jack the first time when we knew Yuya would lose because plot?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope Crow and Shinji don't join the lancers. Sure, the goal is to take allies from Synchro, but those two are boring and shitty characters.  <br>Who would join the lancers? certainly not KINGU</br>  <br>fugg meant for this </br>  <br>Unless Carly has something to do about it with the Lancers or Academia. I HOPU </br>  <br>Well it's good if you have a high level dragon... And Sam has no other cards so</br>  <br>How about no one? It would be funny to see Reiji's keikaku fail.</br>  <br>I'm guessing Yuya's new Synchro Dragon would follow the levels and naming scheme of Beast-Eyes and Rune-Eyes</br>  <br>Do you want me to give you some DMG cosplay or you prefer other ones? Because my folder only have DMG cosplay</br>  <br><br>Akababowl is NOT confirmed</br></br>  <br><br> Going into a basaka modo just to play children's card games <br><br>Embarrassing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Better not post 3D, mods dont like it</br>  <br>Anon, she's not coming back ever...</br>  <br><br>AKABABOWL IS CONFIRMED YOU DUMB BITCH<br>GET FUCKING HYPE</br></br></br>  <br> just to play children's card games </br>  <br>They haven't really said much about Shinji besides him being Crow's friend.

I don't want to buy Blackwings..</br></br>  <br>It's amazing what make-up, the right lighting, and photoshop can do.</br>  <br> He doesn't want to buy Blackwings </br>  <br><br>Both Arc-V and 5Ds are good points to start. If you only want to watch one series go Arc-V because you'll be able to speculate with us. If you feel like you want to get full back into it start with 5Ds. Arc-V has a lot of callbacks to 5Ds</br></br>  <br><br> Arc-V doesn't have MC <br> implying <br> M  elissa  C laire </br></br></br></br>  <br> Rei Shingetsu <br><br>It works, but other Rei would have been better, yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't as based as 5D's MC</br>  <br><br>I'm a complete fucking retard. How have I not noticed that</br></br>  <br><br>She is a whole lot sexier though</br></br>  <br><br> Implying Yusei didn't BECOME Stardust Warrior </br></br>  <br>I'm dropping ARC-V if Gongenzaka loses to Crow.</br>  So Jack's deck still doesn't have any reason or thought put into it. It's still random monsters and Resonators to make Red Demons Dragon  <br>He runs a lot of fiends</br>  <br><br>Lol <br>Bye</br></br></br>  <br><br>It would be absolutely retarded if Crow lost to Gon</br></br>  <br>On your way out remember to  BUY BLACKWINGS </br>   yfw Crow wins every duel and the final duel is Crow vs Jack     Crow is cool! COOL!  <br>How so? All the monsters in his deck so far are of the Red archetype and Crimson Blader</br>  BUY BLACKWINGS<br><br>KOI KOI<br><br>KOI KOI</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think "Red" is really an archetype. Unless Red Eyes is a sub archetype of it</br></br>  <br>It's probably going to be Red Demons archetype</br>  <br><br>KOI KOI KOI</br></br>  <br>Why am I reminded of Weevil?</br>  <br>The hair?</br>  <br>The hair?</br>  <br>The hair?</br>  <br> yugo absorbs yuya and synchro characters replace 5d's cast </br>  <br><br>First episode whete he creates pendulums.<br>Then standard MC power to create extra deck boss monsters<br><br>Aside from that he can go berserker mode but it doesn't really make him more powerful. Rather it makes him go into a very primal state where he only does basic and rudimentary plays with no combos whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  What did Jack the savior do right?  <br>Will Jack be able to have his waifu this time around?</br>  <br><br> Even if Carly returned she would have a different VA <br><br>She's an ugly nerd anyway.

The new BLS stuff implies that Gaia becomes BLS, but that's clearly a retcon.<br><br>The Silent monsters were basically Yugi's soul in Card form, Black Luster Soldier was Atem's Ka or whatever, Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl were the creepy old visier and his loli pupil.

Why the fuck did they make Sora's deck so horribly consistant. This is almost Nekroz kinds of levels.  <br>They want to separate the older kids from the younger kids. Imagine a little kid seeing YGO and being like I can beat the older kids too!<br><br> proceeds to get his ass rekt in one turn by some pretentious Nekroz player who starts shit-talking and making the kid cry <br><br>I've seen it, granted he was using Shaddolls, but still, it's sad to see.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a shame that ninjabro takes his place in the Friendship Cup. <br>What?<br><br><br>He's probably referring to the upcoming episode summary. I still think Reira is in. He's probably in Security uniform camouflage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fluffals  <br> good <br><br>Uhh...wat</br></br></br></br>  <br> He's probably in Security uniform camouflage. <br>Referring to Tsukikage if ti wasn't clear vs. Shinji.</br></br>  <br> not dueling him for the kid  <br>Pleb</br></br>  <br>Go take a look at the new support and come back.</br>  <br>I didn't have my deck with me that day. I still see the kid around though, he didn't lose his spirit at the very least.</br>  <br>Sora pls, even with your new cards your deck is still shit. Tiger and Sheep are your only good cards.</br>  <br>Wasn't there some kind of spoiler about the ninja playing Reira's duel in his place? Maybe I hallucinated it.<br><br><br>Oh man, I hope someday I get the chance to duel someone for someone else's honor.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not using the kids deck to prove good cards aren't everything <br>whats less than a pleb?</br></br>  <br> Fluffal Wing <br> A +3 <br> Not great </br></br></br>  <br>I've seen the kids deck before, there is no way in hell that it could beat T3, let alone Shaddolls. I've tried helping him with deck building, but he just likes the cards he likes, so I'll just let him be if he's having fun.</br>  <br> he didn't lose his spirit at the very least. <br>but some else sure has</br></br>  <br>It's not.</br>  <br>I lost it a long time ago Anon, Xyz just killed me.</br>  <br> Oh man, I hope someday I get the chance to duel someone for someone else's honor. <br>I once saw some smug asshole at my locals "teaching" someone to play, but not really explaining anything properly and toying with them.<br>So, I go up, look at the field and their hand, and proceed to guide them through moves, and win.<br><br>The guy's rage was practically glorious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fantastic<br><br>it's okay anon you fought bravely against the tides<br> but you're still lower than a pleb </br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a good person.</br>  <br>I don't argue with that Anon, he's a cool kid though. I'll give him props for playing with his deck, it's just a mismatch of things he thinks looks cool. I did give him one of my Castels though if that helps.</br>  So, who is your favorite protagonist? Not necessarily who you think is a better protag or better player, just your favorite, for whatever reason.  <br><br>She's growing on me...</br></br>  <br>Orichalchus Atem was my favorite. Other than that, probably Judai.</br>  <br>Yusei. I was always emotionally invested in his duels.</br>  <br>what a major slut.</br>  <br>I've wondered what Academia's reaction would be if Judai returned in their dimension.</br>    <br>They would bow to him because he is the true leader of Fusion and it is his plan to fuse the 4 dimensions</br>  <br>There was an adorable comic where Yuya goes to summon "Odd Eyes..." and Judai shows up instead. Does anybody have it? My Pixiv-fu is weak.</br>  <br>how so he already had his time the shitlord needs to lose to THE MAN.</br>  <br>It can still happen!<br><br>She doesn't even have to say anything. Just show her below the neck or from behind handing Jack a hot cup of Blue-Eyes Mountain coffee then sitting down next to him as he slowly reaches over and pulls off her glasses and sets them down next to his deck and then wraps his arm around her shoulder.</br></br></br>  <br>more importantly what would be Judai's reaction?</br>  <br>I used Synchro,xyz &amp; fusion how does that make you feel?</br>  <br>Wow, this post alone is better than the average Yu-Gi-Oh! fanfiction on AO3/FFNET.</br>  <br>Disgusting, like your entire Dimension Standard.</br>  <br>dark days are coming friend, will you be able to handle to ass fuckinging....the storm is massive will you submit or rebuilding your deck and spending much of your hard...i take it you dotn work so avoiding saying "earn" i would say the money you got from cock sucking cash on gettign a T1 deck?</br>  <br>Same though I'm only dropping it until the Fusion invasion or whenever this Cup ends.</br>  <br> fusion niggers pretending they're superior again </br>  <br> being a fusion shitlord is hard, so i must make other people who uses 3 summon types for fun feel bad because im a faggot. </br>  <br>I'd like it this one too to add to my folder. In the meantime have these..</br>  <br><br>But I'm Synchro, I actually have to try. ;_;</br></br>  Who's subbing this shit? Gotta get my game on  <br>Is it this one anon?<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga_big&amp;illust_id=479576<wbr>85&amp;page=6</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Mono</br>  <br>Is Judai/Yuri seriously a thing? I shouldn't be surprised, but... does Yusei/Yugo and Yuma/Yuto exist too?</br>  <br>They have a site or somewhere where they're subs/links are aggregated? Google just pulls up shit like MyAnimelist</br>  <br>In order of best/slowest to alright/fastest<br>1. GX_ST/NAC<br>2. MonoSubs<br>3. ruSUBan<br><br><br>Yes, yes it is apparently. I'll have to do more....research on Yusei/Yugo &amp; Yuma/Yuto though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes! Thank you very much, anon.</br>    <br>Yes, click the second link when you type in MonoSubs you can figure the rest out from there...i hope.</br>      <br>Also this.</br>  <br>More of those days can be arranged.</br>  <br>I want Judai to show up so Yuri can go all "s-senpai..." on him.</br>  <br>That's impossible given how KoA stupidly translated it as Red Dragon Archfiend instead of the more logical Red Archfiend Dragon</br>  <br><br>Did I hear some Anons mention GX and questionable card art?</br></br>   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Jack Atlas so much, I owned all his cards and merchandise <br> I pray to Jack Atlas every night, thanking him for the burning soul I have been given <br> "Jack is love," I say, "Jack is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a traitor <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Jack <br> I call him a jealous commons <br> He duels me and beats me 2-0 because of Blackwings <br> I am crying now because my pride hurts <br> I lay in bed and it's really cold <br> A burning soul is moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Jack <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "This is entertainment" <br> He grabs me with his mighty arms and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my Duel Disk for Jack <br> He summons a bunch of monsters in one turn <br> I have no cards but I do it for Jack <br> I can feel my field emptying as cards are destroyed by his absolute power <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Jack <br> He laughs a mighty laugh as he synchro summons his very soul <br> My dad walks in <br> Jack looks him deep in the eyes and says, "There is only one king! And it's me!" <br> Jack drives away on his Wheel of Fortune <br> Jack Atlas is love, Jack Atlas is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not there yet, but he's well on his way.</br>  <br> He's probably in Security uniform camouflage. <br>I thought that was Duel Chaser 227</br></br>  <br> S-senpai I'm using masked heroes just like you said! I'm even trying to get Serena-sama to notice my Tuxedo Mask playstyle. </br>  YAMEROOOOOO  <br>Yusei. I love his design, color scheme, monster aces, and deck concept. He's my preferred character.</br>  <br>Do you love SCRAPPU FISTing your opponents?</br>  Crow is going to win against Gon but then goes riprip against Fusion and entrusts his feelings to the lancers  <br>I like bringing out my Junk Warrior</br>  <br>Yes, easily my favorite deck.</br>  <br> all those little baby monsters on the field not destroyed <br> letting synchro have an advantage <br><br>What is going on here...</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yusei design wise and Judai for character development. Yuya is good too but it's so weird to have a straight protagonist this time around.</br>  <br>I like using ching chang chongs to summon Trishula on the opponent's turn if that's what you mean ;)</br>  <br> but it's so weird to have a straight protagonist this time around <br>what?</br></br>  <br>All thanks to giant germ.</br>  <br>Trish should have stayed banned.</br>  <br>Freaking GGs...<br><br>So if and when Jack Atlus is finally defeated...</br></br></br>  <br>Just how disappointed will these qts here be?</br>  <br><br>Syncho dimension gay sexual innuendos</br></br>  <br>Yuya is the most heterosexual protagonist to date.<br><br>Yugi is bisexual perhaps, Judai is gay, Yusei is asexual, Yuma is Astralsexual, and then there is Yuya and his "Muh Yuzu".</br></br></br>  <br>What if she uses Fluffals, but she uses and Xyz variant that doesn't involve cutting them the fuck up?</br>  <br>Don't they look a bit too youg to be cheerleaders?</br>  We've been over this, Yuya isn't straight, he's Yuzusexual. If Yuzu had a cock, he'd be all "well I guess I love cock."  <br>Not for Jack</br>  <br>  Can't navigate a website's content <br>  Calls people faggots <br>http://yugioh-sheets.tumblr.com<br>Get out</br></br></br></br>  <br>Level 4 normal tuner fucking WHEN?</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/<br> &gt; </br></br>  <br>There's nothing that justifies going to tumblr anon</br>  <br> tumblr <br><br>Aren't you the one who should be on their way out?</br></br></br>  <br>So she basically uses cute birds that become bigger cute birds?</br>  Was the shift in living quarters as jarring for anyone else as it was for me?  <br>I don't think Serena noticed honestly.<br><br>In fact most of them outside of the Commons people probably even noticed. Since they come from dimensions where they don't live in shacks starving to death.</br></br></br>  <br>I just realized that those 2 guys that called Gon aniki are fucked. Security saw that they were friends with the people that escaped, so they'll get blamed and sent away to the "bad" facility</br>  Monosubs is okay right?  <br>Not just okay, they are the subs you should be using except if you like Tumblr subs (do they stille exist?)</br>  <br>Security Rebellion when?</br>  <br><br>If Infinity was banned there would be literally nothing wrong with ptolemaus</br></br>  <br>If Plotemaus was banned, they'd literally be nothing wrong with Infinity.</br>  <br><br>So, who deserves the ban? Infinity and let Cyber Dragon die or Ptolemaius and let Tellarknight be less meta?</br></br>  <br>Ptolememes turns rank 5 into a subrank of rank 4. Banning him would also solve most problems should Konami print another powerful rank 5 XYZ. Banning Infinity just means that we are safe until Infinity 2.0 and then the game begins anwe.</br>  <br><br>Yes there would be. Infinity is an unfun piece of shit and is way too easy to summon for it's powerful effect.</br></br>  <br>Castel ;&gt;)</br>  <br>NEGATE that shit bro. You're talking about infinity who can negate everything, including your tiny dick, castel.</br>  <br>Yeah. Those Machine Decks with LV5 Machines are everywhere. They even restricted Superheavy Samurai so they can't abuse Infinity. Meanwhile any Rank 4 deck can access all non Number Rank 5 for some stupid reason.</br>  didnt nobody noticed the pillars in council who looks like timelords' room.<br><br>its the same as yuya's necklade</br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget it's easy as fuck to FIRST TURN DOUBLE INFINITY</br></br>  <br>Ok, I detached trick clown, triggering his eff ss clown and then blade. Overlay for 101 ;)</br>  <br><br> Cyber Dragons depend on Infinity <br><br>This is what's wrong with Infinity too. Infinity doesn't even fit CD's playstyle. CDs are a high attack multi attack beatdown deck. Nova is Xyz CDs done right. Infinity doesn't make any sense. <br>Give Cydras a way ro dump their deck to the grave easier and bring back them chimeratech plays. There</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read Infinity you pavement ape.</br>  <br>How do you double Infinity first turn when Cyber Dragon Infinity can only be summoned with Nova once per turn?</br>  <br>ABSORB THAT SHIT bro. There's no restriction for infinity, you can negate AND ABSORB opponent's monster. <br>EAT THAT FAGGOT.<br><br>What else huh? sure bite me.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ptolemaus is already restricted because it can't summon numbers. The rank 5s it can summon now are perfectly fine aside from Infinity. If that's Konami's worry they can just make new powerful rank 5s number monsters</br></br>  <br>Do you really like to bait with Infinity? or you just want to expand yourr hatred to that monster so he can be insta ban?</br>  <br>That is still bullshit. Big Waraji and Mailman restrictions make me cry. So much for actual Machines getting Infinity.</br>  <br>Chess-kun is gonna join forces with Lex Luthor in excahnge of getting rid of the City Council, isn't he?</br>  <br><br> oldest protagonist <br> probably best character design out of them all <br> alpha as fuck, isn't a bitch <br> can beat up guards like kaiba/jack/shun <br> like you said great deck concept <br><br>he's simply the best</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem with Infinity isn't Infinity it's the decks that can utilize those effects. Decks can constantly and consistently keep materials on him which is what breaks him and some decks have problems actually managing to bait those materials without sacrificing something important. <br><br>Infinity should definitely be limited, and Ptolemy banned.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad he's also asexual as fruck.</br>  <br><br> he's married to dueling </br></br>  <br>Don't forget he has also the best theme.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EJe<wbr>F0N1-kp8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah I'm just replying to that faggot who think it's easy as fuck to defeat infinity.

Isn't that right, chairman? <br> Yes <br>If I had to listen to them all the time I'd hate them too</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant monosubs still hasn't put out subs for 65 yet.</br>  <br>He said it will be up by friday</br>  <br>ah does he have a twitter or something, it seems his website went down awhile ago.</br>  <br>Depends on the deck really. TellarKnights it's extremely hard to deal with it especially considering the ease of which it's gotten out and how many they can get out.</br>  <br><br>twitter.com/monoker0s</br></br>  <br>Thanks bae</br>  <br>nothing in yugioh has made me more hyped then those moments in 5D's where Yusei would be totally fucked, draws a card, smirks then https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5Jr<wbr>orstglj0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Why do people make fun of Yusei's deck?</br>  <br>what is that fusion?</br>  <br>Draco-Equiste</br>  <br>Draco-Knight Equest or something. Used against the Nobles because they were nomming his Synchros.</br>  <br>Except he never actually uses it against them. He uses it against Team Unicorn and then it's never seen again</br>  <br>WARNING: Brace for autism<br>The reason Reiji gets Reira to watch everything carefully is because he can somehow record and play back everything he sees, like that Zetsu guy from Nardo was able to, even though we never saw how he did it.<br> Persona Shutter cards <br> Summoning speech for one of his C/C/C's (the water one, I think) involved something about the power within Reira's own eye <br> Plus we have the weird lens thing jammed in Leo's head <br>Reira is Reiji's walking camcorder.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  any good spells for a performapals/entertanemate deck?  <br>They'll keep Shinji and Chojiro, because they're original characters.

Himika will probably sell out his NEETcave and fuck-up Nakajima, and Reira will stab Reiji in the back when they both try to confront Leo.<br><br>Good news is we get to see Reira cry, and Reiji mutter something about "that wasn't part of the plan."</br></br></br>  <br> Slut. <br><br>But she is Leo's wife. Unless you're implying she was fucking Reiji.</br></br></br>  <br>Ruri is going to use a bird deck.

XD</br>  Whew, better catch up on One Piece then...  We all die one day anyway.  Is Death Note a decent show according to /a/? I ask because /a/ apparently hates all popular animes?  <br> /a/ apparently hates all popular animes <br> animes <br>We only hate animes though. We do like anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Back to whatever shithole you crawled from</br>  Is Fate as bad as /a/ makes it out to be?  Maybe.  <br>Fate is not even bad, it's just inferior.</br>  <br>Read the VN and find out.</br>  Everything is 10 times worse than /a/ makes it out to be.  <br> Read a 50+ hour VN <br><br>I could get through 6-7 anime instead. Is it really worth the investment?</br></br></br>  No, /a/ actually likes Fate, which means it's much worse than /a/ makes it out to be.  <br>The VN is great. <br>Popular series just get shit on here<br>Capcha was Arthur</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah if you care.</br>  ---I'll show you.<br>This is what it means to kill something.<br> Welcome to this wonderful killing chamber. </br></br>  <br>No, UBW is pretty decent for a shounen anime and the VN is alright (by VN standards) especially considering when it came out.</br>  <br>shiki would wreck archer even in ubw</br>  <br>Not it isn't, you can watch 6-7 hours of anime or get 42-43 hours more of terribly written filler</br>  /a/ doesn't make it out to be bad. Otherwise there wouldn't be a million daily threads about it. <br><br>You're a faggot, OP.</br></br>  Why does /a/ bash Servant Saber yet glorify Tohsaka Rin?  <br>Seiba is the most popular Fate so we have to be contrarian and hate her.</br>    It's either the best thing since sliced bread according to fanboys or the worst thing since Hitler according to trolls.<br><br>For me it's just a fun little battle series. And mythological heroes is a legitimately cool idea.</br></br>  <br>*heroes from different periods in a battle royale</br>  <br> It's either the best thing since sliced bread according to trolls or the worst thing since Hitler according to trolls. <br>Fixed. I like it, it's good, but it has it's flaws.</br></br>  <br>Shiki is shit unless his blood kicks in, which I don't think would get triggered by le red man</br>  <br>servants are non human, so it would get triggered</br>  <br>UBW is trash</br>  <br> /a/ doesn't make it out to be bad <br><br/></br></br>  What happened to the "Saber cuck lol" meme that was running rampant last time I visited this place? Was it just some bored anon who eventually got bored of it as well?  <br>saber is literally a cuck though</br>  <br>Sakura gets cucked more than any other character in the VN. Even by her own Servant.</br>   is x as bad as 4chan makes it out to be? <br><br>The answer is almost always no, unless something truly wretched like Pupa, Dragonball Evolution, Metroid Other M, or   you're waifu </br></br>  Even worse.  <br>That's the same ratio of content in most anime.</br>  <br>LITTLE</br>  <br> forming opinions based on what others tell you <br>Read it; like it or don't while not being autistic about it; proceed to wonder why fanbase is autistic anyway; realize any sort of discussion about it on /a/ is terrible and never post in/make threads again<br><br><br> forming opinions based on an adaptation without having seen/read the source material </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Rin is the best girl.</br>  Average as average can be.<br>If you have literally nothing to do, read the VN.<br>Otherwise, just go watch better anime.<br>It wasn't worth the time investment, honestly.</br></br></br>  <br>it's not an opinion you cuck, it's factually true.</br>  <br>Rin is supreme.</br>  <br>She's scary</br>  <br>This anon speaks facts.</br>  <br><br>post more smokey rins</br></br>  <br>Rin owns two Shirous, every other heroine only has one Shirou. Rin is best confirmed.</br>  <br>They're both shit along with every other girl from the VN</br>  Everything I see posted on here about it, shitposting or otherwise, makes it out to be stupidly pretentious and deep in the way it's written and that just doesn't make me interested in it at all.  <br> One guy = /a/ <br>m8</br></br>  <br>Fabulous opinion, well too bad I guess this wasn't for you.</br>  <br>If it keeps people like you out, all the better.</br>  <br>Rin is an addict.</br>  <br><br>I'd say it's worth reading. You've probably been spoiled on most of the twists due to being on /a/, but it still can be fun. It's bloated as hell, but with good characters and an interesting setting.</br></br>  <br>Shit taste.<br><br>Rin's pretty ugly. Her design is a joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is a sweetheart.</br>  <br>What makes you say that?</br>  <br><br><br>Twintails are generic ZR look with terrible colors are awful past 12 years old. Her only good look is in HF Epilogue.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is always good.<br><br>In fact, Rin is great.</br></br></br>  <br>There's only one way to find out.</br>  <br>She looks retarded.</br>  <br>Fate females are shit, yes.</br>  It's worse.<br>But still not as bad as the VNs.</br>  <br> Disliking ZR <br>Your opinion is worthless.</br></br>  Europoor time is when this fanbase is complete shit.  Where's the Grand Order Nasu?  <br>  females are shit, yes. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  It is a complicated thing. It is subjectively entertaining but objectively overrated.  <br>Ive watched the '06 anime and UBW. 06 and the second half of UBW were shit. First half of UBW is alright.<br><br>Worth watching for Tohsaka.</br></br></br>  <br>No, Shirou's character is a masterpiece. In fact, If Shirou's character wasn't in a battle series with chuuni magical elements in a niche Japanese medium he'd be marveled as a literary masterpiece, a modern Hamlet that defines modern protagonists. First he'd need to be moved into a story without magic, and instead his backstory was that he was a survivor of a terrorist bombing 10 years and was then saved by the terrorist who planned the whole event. Then you could replace all the magical backstory with political elements and set the story in the Middle East, replace the Holy Grail War with a regular war, etc. If you had a more "serious" story that people didn't judge on the fact it had porn scenes and was from Japan, people would be regarding Shirou as one of the most interesting protagonists of modern literature. This is a fact that none of us can escape from even if we insult Fate as a chuuni eroge.</br>  <br>/a/ makes Fate out to be bad? Last I checked the more shitposting a series gets, the better it usually is. That's how I usually go about taking recommendations from /a/ and I haven't been steered wrong since.</br>  <br>Rin is not dumb.</br>  <br>I've only read the VN so I can't really recommend the anime versions , but I really enjoyed it. Yeah It took like 4 days in game to complete the three routes and it's just like any other typical shonen, but that's just how it is.</br>  <br> Whore of Babylon figure among best King figures </br>  <br>If there was an accepted canon of anime that any fan was expected to be familiar with, Fate would be in there so you might as well watch/read it. At the very least for shitposting purposes.</br>  Does Shirou ever stop being so bland in UBW? I'm vaguely aware of his characterization being appreciated on /a/ but jesus fuck he does not have a drop of charisma so far.  <br>How far are you? He gets better towards the end of 2014UBW but in general his characterization and development was handled much better in the VN.</br>  <br>His character is supposed to be hollow for the most part, but through the series, as he fights for his ideal and gets closer to Rin, he does emote more.<br><br><br>Nasu actually said the anime got his characterization closer to how he originally wanted him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou only really gets to God-tier MC status in HF. UBW is pretty much default Shirou.<br><br>The anime is also less focused on his characterization, which is a real shame, because everything outside Shirou's head is ultimately irrelevant.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou <br> bland </br></br>  <br> Shirou only really gets to God-tier MC status in HF. UBW is pretty much default Shirou. <br><br>Cool opinion, man. Default Shirou is Fate Shirou. UBW Shirou is a Shirou whose characterization is actually examined.<br><br>The anime handled his character fine too. They just didn't narrate every word in his head.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Director Miura ruined his characterization, unfortunately.</br>  <br> God-tier MC status in HF <br> Throws away ideology for undeserving wormslut <br>It's an odd feeling where Archer couldn't do what Sakura unintentionally did.</br></br></br>  <br>Only 7 episodes, it's just my first impression and it's a little jarring after f/z. <br><br>If I like him more by the end I think I might read the vn.</br></br></br>  <br>His ideal was shit.<br><br>SHIIIIIIT</br></br></br>  <br>If for some reason you're still on a 4 hour old thread, think of it this way: This is the book/game/source to the movie. Would you rather just watch the Postal movie or play the games?</br>  <br>It's not a mistake.</br>  <br> Shirou only really gets to God-tier MC status in HF. <br>Nah that's him going from a non-generic MC to a full blown generic MC. <br><br>You suffer from shit taste, so just kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  Yes   I see. And what about Shirou, the main character? <br> Nasu: With anime, I think power balance that is shown objectively is ideal. This is just the image that the creator has in his head, but the ideal Shirou as a character study is a guy who doesn't crack one smile through the whole show. But in contrast, to get the players to enjoy themselves during the long game, I had to have him pull off comedy bits as well. </br>  <br>Looking pretty cool there shirou</br>  <br> Not wanting to be a hero of justice <br>I bet you selected "I want to protect Sakura" pheb.</br></br>  <br>It's one of those things where I'm pretty sure I just liked it because it was long and I got invested in the characters. In retrospect, it looks way, way worse. Like Muv-Luv.</br>  <br>If you liked it the first time through, what's the problem?</br>  <br>And then you get to see him start to smile as he interacts with Rin. I'm pretty sure this is the first time that he smiles in the show, and you see how it shocks her.</br>  <br>You can enjoy something in the moment without it being good.</br>  <br>What's wrong with enjoying things that aren't necessarily good?<br><br>Not that I'm claiming Muv-Luv or Fate aren't good, I do not agree with you at all there.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a cool little visual arc here that I like. You see him smile here as Rin tries to console him over Ilya's death, which connects to the Archer smile at the end, but it's also a good bit of character development for him too.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with it, but if someone asks me if it's good afterwards, I'm going to say "no."</br>  <br>The show took out 99% of his inner thoughts, which when considering the entire story is meant to be seen through the eyes of this guy is a pretty big loss.</br>  <br>You see him smile when Rin comes running after his fight with Rin, and it's by far the biggest smile he's had yet. I like to think it's cause he got his answer there.</br>  <br> her ears turning red when she blushes <br>Why do people hate this studio again? Because they're popular or something?</br></br>  OP here<br><br>Can I read one route and decide what to do from there or do I have to do all of them?</br></br>  <br>Each route is 33% of the story.<br><br>You can not be said to have read it if you have only read one route.</br></br></br>  <br>This is something you'd only catch on the broadcast version, but I think it's nice. The end title card thing for the last card is just Shirou smiling. It's a cool little end to things that kind of tells you, "hey, he's gonna end up alright".</br>  <br>1. -Fate-<br>2.

Does "good" mean it wasn't enjoyable?</br>  <br>Plus there's also promo art like this that shows him happy after everything.<br><br>Anyway I'm just fucking rambling, but I just noticed this stuff after watching the show reading interviews.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Rin is an heartless magus that would sacrifice her crush/partner in order to win the holy grail war</br>  <br>geez what gave it away? <br><br>the only reason you're allowed to like Fate somewhat is because other places like to shit on it so it's still somewhat contrarian <br><br>try making a thread about something that's universally loved like TTGL or Bebop and see what that gets you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like, writing quality. Logical consistency. Themes. Complexity. Lack of half a dozen cooking scenes.<br><br>Good is enjoyable, but enjoyable is not good. You can enjoy reading total garbage.<br><br>Not that Fate/Stay Night was garbage, I just don't think it's good because of all the dumb stuff in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's cool to be contrarian.</br>  Since people were talking about Shirou as a character, I got to thinking about something F/HA, which I've started reading a few days ago. During the scene with  Caren when they finally get a chance to talk behind the Ryuudou Temple but then have to fight that pillar of black things, it made me think that Avenger and Shirou might be connected somehow. He can't be both the red man and this black guy, right?  I don't mind a confirmation since I've already seen what he looks like outside of being black blob.  <br> Shirou is the black man </br>  <br>It will be interesting seeing how that plays out. I wonder just how many Shirous there are?</br>  <br>why is arc so cute<br><br>best tm girl</br></br></br>  <br> Unlimited Arcueid Works </br>  <br><br>most of the people who I hear complain about the plot are the ones that missed most of what was going on on their first playthrough or have forgotten it so I'm relatively sceptical of anyone who claims that there's some problem with it,<br><br>still it's not like I rated the series particularly highly it just bugs me when people complain about writing when it's clearly more thought out than what we usually get from fantasy or science fiction series<br><br>in fact that seems to be the problem, it explains everything so much detail so that when information gets omitted it feels like a glaring plothole whereas frequently the information is something the protagonists just couldn't know about under the circumstances <br><br>I really can't think of anything to call stupid in this series other than King Arthur is a girl and Zelretch has a really plot convenient dagger, everything else gets introduced and explained and rooted in the setting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that by explaining things so much is what lowers the quality of the writing. Infodumps should not be necessary, but it is understandable when having to set up the world that Nasu did. The rule "show, not tell" is something that can be difficult to take to heart, but once it is properly ingrained into one's storymaking and writing, then it vastly improves a writer's work.<br><br>Also, some people might point out that World's #1 Grandpa Zouken sort of just shows up for little reason in HF, and that his existence is literally a plothole. I didn't especially mind it, but I am curious why he didn't do anything in the other routes.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but you say stuff about the whole "show, don't tell" thing, but then you've got folks who get super pissed that the anime didn't stop to explain every little detail of what was going on with the characters and the situation. It's kind of a catch 22.</br>  <br>Because Heaven's Feel Shirou was slightly nicer to Sakura than the other two.</br>  <br>I haven't watched the anime yet, but from what an anon said in this thread, as well as some other threads talking about other VN or LN adaptations, what seems to be problem is that the protagonist's thoughts aren't heard. The VN makes it very clear what Shirou is thinking at times, but I also wouldn't say that the anime not showing that is necessarily bad. If that's all someone watches of the Fate/ Stay Night product, then yes, they would be missing out.</br>  <br> I haven't watched the anime yet <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>I'm not , but I don't have a lot to say. It's a very straightforward fantasy story with tons of exposition, plot contrivances, and goofball stuff. It ping-pongs between battle shit with quantified power levels ripped out of last night's PnP game, slice-of-life with King Arthur, and a threesome in the forest to power people up with semen.<br><br>It's fun, but that doesn't make it good.</br></br></br>  <br>The anime doesn't really miss anything, though. It just doesn't treat the audience as mindless. If you actually watch and listen, you'll get it.<br><br>They set out a goal to try and tell the story visually. Literally aiming to "show, not tell".<br><br> When the art is good, you don't need to spell it out </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because I was finishing Tsukihime and reading through KT, and now I'm reading F/HA. I'll check it out after taking a break.</br>  <br>"show don't tell" is a nice platitude to throw around if you hate long form fiction but can't tell what's wrong with it<br><br>some of the stuff literally can't be shown as it involves metaphysics that you're either familiar with from religious studies or have never heard of before thus leaving you lagging behind the plot<br><br>other times the explanation is important to the events that happen immediately after as well as much later still other times the information isn't explained and is implied in exactly the way "show don't tell" would have it happen but is consequently missed by the audience, in most cases it's not like it's being subtle either "hey kotomine couldn't love his own child here he is defending a giant baby made of evil, geddit GEDDIT? " is about as low key as it gets</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>i love this pic<br><br>when the tsukihime remake happens we must have another season of carnival phantasm</br></br></br>  <br>Not at all. I find the entire series to be very fun to watch. But Don't take my word for it, Zero and Stay Night are free on Hulu</br>  Always keep this in mind:<br>On the internet and /a/ specifically everything is either amazing or its complete dog shit there is almost never an in between.<br>Give it a watch for yourself and make your own judgment by forming an opinion through seeing it for yourself and not because /a/ told you too.</br></br>  <br>Rin is the only one with a bad design. Saber looks good and Sakura is okay.<br><br>Okay, I lied Caster and Medusa in their Servant gears also look stupid. But Medusa in her civilian clothes is beautiful.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with ZR but Rin looks like a tryhard DA design tier of 'how to roll fetishes' in a character for a fanfic than a natural ZR.</br>  <br>You have a bad design.</br>  <br>  Is it really worth the investment? <br><br>If you like reading and care about Fate. <br>I really don't get you people, if you force yourselves to read something how do you expect to like it? All you'll do is hate it and shipost later.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Red man is not human<br><br>Because Saber is main girl, simple as that</br></br></br>  <br>it's about the opportunity cost<br><br>if i'm going to read ONE VN is it worth skipping 5-6 anime from my backlog?</br></br></br>  <br>So is Arc, who is even worse than Saber.</br>  <br>Why not just watch those anime later? They aren't going anywhere.</br>  <br> Arc, who is even worse than Saber <br><br>kek, back to BL with you</br></br></br>  <br>It's an entire thing people don't seem to get that its very easy for her to be heartless at times, which is why she relies on or needs a morality puppet to stop her from going too far that way, because she doesn't want to really go that way either.<br><br>She tries to put duty above everything and put on the face of a magus, a cold killing magus at times.<br><br>Sometimes when she's taken it too far she might end up either breaking or regretting it forever, but she has no doubts and the reader should have no doubts that she won't hesitate to go that way. Its even noted in one of the bios, along with how she doesn't like that part of herself.<br><br>There's kind of an entire route that explores this side of her character, as Shirou plays her morality pet to stop her from going too far, and secretly she's thankful that he does it and that he believes in her that she won't do it in the end.<br><br>Its an odd contradiction with her character; that she's possibly the softest one in some ways, the most normal one, yet there is still this coldness.<br><br>Its similar to Ciel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing you have to understand is that, particularly in UBW, Shirou does change her. Archer outright notes she starts to act soft because of him.<br><br>She was taught to be the perfect magus; strong will, ruthless, and willing to do anything to live up to her family name, but seeing Shirou, a complete contradiction in what she thinks a magi should be, starts to make her second guess herself. You see early on where she absolutely balks at the way Kerry taught Shirou, but as she gets to know him, understand his morals and the way he lives, she finds that maybe there is more than one way to be a mage. She has that big moment in the Einzbern basement where she says the world needs people like Shirou.<br><br>Scenes like the one the guy posted only happen if you fail to play the VN as Shirou would naturally react. Shirou of course would forgive Lancer, but if you the player don't, the image Rin has built up of Shirou starts to go away, and she reverts to how she thinks she should play things out as a mage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Have you read it? It's worse. <br><br>/a/ goes really easy on this shit, but it's awful.</br></br></br></br>  HA voice patch when?  <br>Not really, you just have shit taste. Rin's design is old as fuck.</br>  Gilgamesh is chaotic good  <br>he is chaotic neutral imo<br><br>doesn't really give a shit about anything as long as he gets to enjoy fine things</br></br></br>  <br>He's chaotic good<br><br>Anything you would repeat without end cannot change the facts in stone.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope</br>  The only good thing to come out of Fate is the NTR hentai  <br>FSN is the worst in the series. It has some good concepts and fun parts, but there are also the hilariously written R18 scenes. <br><br>I just don't get Rinfags, if she was male or if they actually met such a person they'd think she's an annoying bitch, but people seem to look past her character.</br></br></br>  <br>What exactly is annoying about her? I think she's probably the most down to earth of the bunch.</br>  <br>what makes him chaotic good?<br><br>it's kind of hard to be on the good half when the world belongs to you anyways<br><br>but what actions did he take in f/z or f/sn that led him to become good? this alignment seems totally meaningless and forced</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet here you are pissing away time on 4chan.</br>  <br>Watch Fate/Zero and read the Tsukihime manga instead of this.</br>  <br> what makes him chaotic good? <br><br>He's good, but in a chaotic way; or as Nasu puts it..<br><br> His nature is Chaotic Good. <br> A cold-blooded tyrant, and a hero who had sought and enjoyed all manners of treasures and pleasures. <br> Though capricious and temperamental, he does not (generally) kill someone simply because he is in a foul temper. <br> When he kills a person, it is either because that someone’s soul is abominable, or because that person has become an enemy of his. <br><br> King and sentencer who weighs both good and evil equally. <br> To him, a life is only “that which will die this moment” or “that which will one day die.” <br> A being who is recognized by Gilgamesh as “a life that must die this moment” will be slain, even if a sage. <br><br> “So in the end it has nothing to do with rules or conditions and just depends on what he feels like that day?!” <br> This kind of reaction is understandable, but that is what a king is. <br> Whether astute judgment synonymous to the truth of the universe, <br> or misrule during a drunken stupor, <br> if he is the one to implement it, it would become the indisputable adjudication of the king. <br> Such is the absolute sovereign. <br><br> Though some see him as similar to Iskandar in their egocentricity, the greatest difference between the two is that Gilgamesh has no need of vassals. <br> Gilgamesh is a king who, from start to end, reigns by means of only “himself.” What he loves are “treasures” and “tools,” while a “person” is no more than that which must one day perish. <br> ……No matter how worthy of love he may acknowledge that to be. <br><br> Considering CCC’s themes, women’s issues can’t be avoided. Gil’s type is a “noble maiden.” (Ko-Gil’s is a “wildflower.”) <br> He dislikes women who are dependent on men and yet would make use of men. In other words, he dislikes “womanlike” women </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i think nasu just doesn't understand what chaotic good means<br><br>what you posted encapsulates a chatoic neutral character perfectly</br></br></br>  <br>Well to me it's her being so loud,but that's just my own opinion.</br>  <br>He's whimsical, he wants the best for humans, his methods to reach this can be chaotic but it has been proven its not for evils sake that he does this but rather he actually is legit in his ways even if they are warped, he's not trying to end all life, he's trying to create humans that are strong enough to withstand what's the come and reach towards the stars. He's been shown to be like a parent, but an Asian parent.<br><br>He's a dad in a home, gets word a meteor is going to hit his house, family ain't hearing shit or they're lazy, think he's crazy, he's also quite stupid since the method he comes up with to get them to get a move on already is to set the house on fire, admits that some of the family will likely die in the fire in the process but the ones that survive will become Batman. Shirou breaks into the house and puts out the fire saying "No one will die, nothing will happen, no meteors, people will live", and then kills the dad himself in some strange contradiction. Then a few years later the meteor hits just as scheduled, and aliens called TYPES kill everyone.<br><br>Gilgamesh is right, but his methods are sometimes stupid<br><br>He can see the end of humanity, its part of why he grew warped as an adult along with his solitude of no one being able to understand his path except Enkidu. He has the same Clairvoyance has Merlin, except he sometimes gets involved.<br><br>He's a guy that would indulge in all sins and deem them as acceptable, he's by no means entirely correct, but everything from F/SN, Zero, CCC, to Strange has shown he really does mean well in there and he's not just doing it for the sake of evil, he does do it for humanity. There's a reason he's considered a hero on occasion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean I guess it all comes down to opinion, but I like her cause it feels like you could actually have a decent conversation with her, you know? Sakura's a little too polite and doting, while Saber is just kind of polite.<br><br>Plus I mean she only really gets annoyed at understandable situations. If you fucking saw a guy literally get killed, and then a couple hours later run head first into a fight between Heracles and King Arthur, you'd probably think he was crazy too.</br></br></br>  <br> Well to me it's her being so loud <br>Then you don't know loud at all. Damn if you consider her loud then most people might annoy you now that I think about it.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but he's not evil nor is he crazy, which chaotic neutral would signify. His alignment lies towards "good": he is basically on the side of preserving or saving humanity naturally. If you just look at him in F/SN, then one would not see an accurate representation of him due to the Grail's taint. If he sees a human worth respecting, then his own "good" part is brought out. Keep in mind that the definitions of "good" and "evil" can change somewhat between persons. One person might say that killing is an absolute evil, while another would say not killing is the same. I don't mean to argue that there are no absolute "good" and "evil", but that one society's laws are not always the same as others. Saying that Gilgamesh is anything other than "Good" is due to looking at him biased on your society's laws without taking into regard his society's. Then again, he IS the law.</br>  <br><br>I don't know what you mean, but Saber and Sakura had times they put Shirou in his place or argued him down. They just don't tease or argue all the time. Maybe it's just your taste to have more vitriolic conversation.<br><br>Sakura seems like she is slow in a conversation, but it's more often because she thinks before she speaks. Something someone who has been tortured often would learn quickly is attentiveness and tact. But that also makes her insightful to avoid conversational mistakes by reading people. She teases Shirou often enough, she doesn't need to make it into a skit or routine.<br><br>And as a king, being diplomatic is customary, so Saber not immediately hounding people in conversation is normal. She is stubborn in other ways, and calls Shirou out several times.<br><br>Rin being more boisterous than the other two is something likely attributed to her living with less shackles than they did. She was always treated well throughout childhood, and regarded as a beauty without flaw and little scrutiny. So she behaves like someone who has lived that way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She was always treated well throughout childhood <br>Not really. Are you even the same anon who finds Rin annoying?</br></br>  <br>Maybe, maybe not. It could end up taking more than a hundred hours if your concentration isn't great while reading.</br>  <br>Red man is a supernatural monster scumbag, so it would.</br>  <br> She was always treated well throughout childhood <br><br>Her dad was murdered, her mom was turned into a vegetable, and she was essentially raised alone with the exception of visits from her dad's murderer.<br><br>Like, okay, it's not worm rape, but that's not exactly an amazing childhood.<br><br>And really, Rin just sees past Shirou's bullshit. She's the one who really notices there's something wrong with him, and she tries her best to help him. She's the one who takes him on the date and tries to make him happy. She teases him, but Shirou learns to tease right back. It's a nice dynamic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> does dumb shit all the time <br> not dumb <br>K, pal.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because he has brown skin and white hair doesn't mean he is a monster.</br>  <br><br>Nope I am not, I rather like her.<br><br>I just provided commentary.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Arturia gave a shit about her wife getting dicked by Lancelot <br>Too busy doing kingly things to deal with literal pleb lyfe. Only thing that made her remotely sexual was that one time she was given dick to do dirty work, and when she was summoned to be Shirou's waifu.</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br> Nope I am not <br>Which is why I asked your typing pattern is recognizable.</br></br>  <br>  makes all the important decisions with his dick <br>  rushes to get himself killed and only gets saved every single bloody time by plot armour <br>  idiotic philosophy no matter the route <br>  generally stupid to the point he ought to visit a doctor about it and get a caretaker <br>Nasu is a fucking hack, m8.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a genius.</br>  <br>Genius of fuck ups maybe.</br>  <br>Brown people need to go back to where they came from.</br>  <br>Saber is the worst servant ever she is lancer tier</br>  <br>In Christianity, I think that is what is described as 'Heaven', anon.</br>  <br>Rin is the smartest heroine.</br>  <br>Can you point out her fuck ups?</br>  <br>Well she might be smarter than her slut of a sister, but Shirou would still outwit her.</br>  <br>She figured out how to beat Gil before Shirou. Shirou only figured it out thanks to Archer telling him and him having a feeling.</br>  <br>Nah, she didn't.</br>  <br>Shirou figured it out first, this was shown in Fate route with him only having seen his NPs once to realize his identity. UBW shouldn't be any different really, upon seeing those NPs he realized that this could only be one guy.<br><br>First two routes someone usually speaks up first, as we get the slightest clue in the narrative that somethings up with him but usually people dismiss it.<br><br>We see a few examples of this guy of thing, but usually in the narrative we see him basically figure it out first.<br><br>By the third route they really aren't hiding much, so he directly calls out what Caster's NP can do upon seeing it for the first time since we already know how his ability works by now. One look at the dagger and he's already analyzed it, so he automatically knows.<br><br>In Fate route Shirou realizes who Gil is first almost off the bat, but people don't realize the oddity about this because Gilgamesh proudly claims his own identity before one can say it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Those events have nothing to do with how she was treated, I am aware she had burdens. But what I argued was that she wasn't this amazingly flawless self-made girl in comparison to the other heroines that some tote her as. She is a down to earth person with her own issues. <br><br>She had help from family members about Aoi and Tokiomi, and after that event, led an actually cheerful life with many friends. She goes on frequent shopping trips and outings with Makidera and Ayako.<br><br>Also, Kirei, while being a snake, ironically raised her well, and she will admit, was good as a master. He gave her the proper tutelage and instruction, medicines to dull the pain of the crest, and lessons to defend herself. It would piss her off more in fact to look over her life the fact that such a snake raised her properly and with care.<br><br>I am just of the mind that dismissing the positive aspects of other heroines in favor of pointing out another's strengths is generally bad, because it fosters misconceptions of the characters.<br><br>Rin is a balance yes, but that is again because she was raised with less shackles, and more options. But it isn't like Saber and Sakura don't help Shirou's distortion in their own ways. Saber with a personal understanding of that martyr type of mentality, and Sakura's often blunt and straightforward affection help him to start valuing himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but then you've got folks who get super pissed that the anime didn't stop to explain every little detail of what was going on with the characters and the situation. <br>It feels bad admitting this, but I am one of those people. I just feel like in the VN all the characters a deeper because we get a greater, more fleshed out grasp of what each of the characters are like in their heads. What the intensity of the fight feels like when you've been cut and are bleeding all over yourself while worrying about the one you love over there, you know things like that. I MISS that in the anime. It just isn't there.<br><br>I get the idea behind show don't tell', I really do. And the anime does things that a VN can never do, like really bring a character to life through more detailed interactions, expressions, and things like that. Also the fights are wonderfully vivid and attention grabbing. Its just a pure difference in the medium. <br><br>The VN is better at some things, while the anime is better at others. To get to the point of 'nirvana' in F/SN, where you can benefit from the having the knowledge and depth of each character from their VN portions, and watching their VN actions brought to life in the anime, you simply have to watch/read both. <br><br><br>I'm literally reading that part in the VN, right now anon. He says he 'would have had better luck' while Rin tells him straight up, 'yo this is how we beat this nigga'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She did, she put together the clues of why Gil didn't like Archer and Shirou.<br><br>I am talking about the clues that she pieces together that Shirou misses.</br></br></br>  <br>Where did you get this from? is there more of this?</br>  <br><br>Rin's just pulling nonsense out of her arse there.</br></br>  <br>All Rin did was go "He's a goldy" and somehow put together the pieces based on a nickname she created at the time, because she was jealous of his riches.<br><br>Shirou put it together because he could read all of his NPs, and realized they were all real, more than real they made all other NPs look like dirt.</br></br></br>  <br>It's from the UBW box set. I personally don't own it, but I've got some pages of interviews.<br><br>Here is the second part of the Miura interview.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu interview part 1.</br>  <br>No she isn't.<br><br>I wasn't even talking about that scene I am talking about the scene where they discuss how to beat him before they fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> before they fuck <br>Stop reading the outdated version.</br></br>  Ah fuck, I'm really dumb. I messed up the page order.<br><br>Nasu interview.<br><br><br><br>Miura interview.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read both, and?</br>  <br>Not that guy, but that shit's in the censored version too.</br>  <br> and after that event, led an actually cheerful life with many friends <br><br>Didn't she actually lose most of her friends because of the magical girl stunt that happened when she was a kid?</br></br></br>  <br> Saber with a personal understanding of that martyr type of mentality, and Sakura's often blunt and straightforward affection help him to start valuing himself. <br>Doesn't Shirou give Saber a lesson in the end and I don't remember Sakura helping him much with that.</br></br>  <br><br>She exaggerated, she was embarassed Ruby possessed her and made her an idol singer and it shocked people. <br><br>She and Issei had a combative relationship in middle school, which is why they are like they are in high school.<br><br>Plus it was kind of obvious Rin kept her distance from people, not the other way around, given she has admirers of both sexes in high school. Basically the unapproachable school idol cliche. They lampshade it a lot in Hollow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally reading this now, for the first time, as I read your post. Please let me share my first time with you, anons.</br></br>  <br>Oh, you are going to have fun.</br>  <br>You're actually supposed to see dolphins here. Anything else is not canon.</br>  <br>Fusing couple dimensions together (HA)<br>Deciding to piss-off of her sister that a) had access to basically infinite amount of magical energy b) was already nearing psychological breakdown and probably would had given up if Rin hadn't had decided to piss her off (HF)<br>Wasting a command spell to enforce overly broad order (Prologue)<br><br>As far as I'm concerned those are her worst fuck ups.<br><br><br>I hope that ain't a uTorrent logo that I'm seeing on your taskbar.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dolphins?

That was the excuse made up to bring some logic to Avenger's dream, but she didn't do that.</br></br></br>  This writing is getting me hot and bothered.  <br> not using 4chanX. </br>  <br>Dolphins transfer some of Rin's shit over to Shirou, so there's no need to have sex.</br>  <br>That sounds really hilarious. Is this in the anime as well?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9fS<wbr>hyCWTfKw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>To be honest it's actually kind of a nice scene.</br></br></br>  <br>They are both canon.<br><br>Yeah it's in the anime.</br></br></br>   tfw you realise there's a vanilla patch available <br>I'd been indecisive about trying the VN because I don't want to play  non homo  eroge, this is good.</br>  <br> They are both canon. <br>No they aren't. The old stuff stopped being canon ages ago.</br></br>  <br>Citation needed. It was released recently too.</br>  <br><br>Sakura is family, and she has several parts in HF where she shows Shirou honest, no bullshit affection and chastises him about not taking care of himself. But also that she appreciates him as he is, and wants to protect the clumsy boy she saw that day under the setting sun. They already act like two close people who have lived together awhile either way.<br><br>Part of the way to treat Shirou's is getting him to value himself, and you do that with honest understanding and love. Didn't you see how the future Rin from the Zelretch treasure box scene in Hollow lectured the current Rin about just that?<br><br>Saber learned from him as well, your point? Through seeing and talking with her, he better understood himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Censored or uncensored, they fucked eventually.  Rin doesn't shave her pubes? Wtf is this. Everyone should shave their pubes.  <br>Ah shit, should have bleeped the nips, right?</br>    <br>Every version since has skipped the old junk. Nasu clearly has put all that behind him and into the dustbin of history.</br>  <br>appchan x is better.</br>  Quality life advice from Shirou.  <br>Check you privilege, cuting'o'phobe!</br>  Where were you when Rin creampied Luvia while Ilya watched?  <br>The PC 18+ release has actually had several re-releases. Hollow Ataraxia too.</br>  <br>Why is this scene so fucking sexy?</br>  <br>Well earlier that anon mentioned that Rin was the only one to worry about that which is true. Saber route was focused on her and same with Sakura, he learned from both routes but only Rin took an initiative. Not sure about Sakura, the story gave me the impression that she didn't know how broken he was or it just didn't cross her head since she is warped too but she knew about his ideal.</br>  <br>Those 2 should fuck already.</br>  <br>It looked shaved to me, James.</br>  <br>They do in HF normal.</br>  I guess it was Ilya's birthday a couple days ago, or something?  <br>Because you like the idea of Shirou fucking your waifu and cucking your in the process.</br>  <br>Saber's not my wiafu. She's the female character I like the most. Just s Shirou is my most favorite male character.</br>  <br>Am I the only one who thought Saber looked older in this sex scene?</br>  10/10 line.<br><br><br>Its a plothole man, text says he goes past the pubes, image is a Nair'd pubic area. Come on now, wheres my consistency?</br></br></br>  <br> actually liking shirou </br>  <br>Haven't you noticed than in Eroge they always mention pubes but you don't see them? I think it implies that they are very tiny.</br>  <br>You can call it a 50+ hour anime, but since your goal is to find out whether the fate route sucks or not, you can just finish it in less than 12 hours or so if you read through it at a fast pace. I would say go for it, but you would only waste your time if you saw UBW, unless you want Saber's backstory in more detail and the H scenes for her, along with the altered route.</br>  <br>DEEN really tried to make Shirou look like shit, didn't they?<br><br>I mean it doesn't help they picked the Fate route in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>Fate route being first makes sense. My only problem was that they made Shirou into a retard and they added things from the other routes.</br>  <br>It's similar, but I'm near 100% sure that the narration refers to Sakura and Ciel's hair as black at least once in Fate and Tsukihime. <br> If anyone could back me up on that, it'd be nice. </br></br>  Man, that bath scene with Rider in F/HA was really nice. However, I don't understand why he was so sensitive afterwards. Does anyone know?  <br>Shirou was always a retard.</br>  <br>He gets a lot better in UBW and HF.</br>  <br>Don't insult my Fate route.<br><br> Honestly though, its damn shame Archer gets all of a few dozen screens, Cu doesn't get to be his awesome self, Shirou doesn't get as badass as he does in UBW although what he does get is through legitimate hard work. <br><br>I just wish all characters had a chance to do things in all routes, though I understand why that just isn't feasible in this VN.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he was more retarded and they made some serious scenes into a comedy with him being a bigger denser retard.</br>  <br>How is he a retard in Fate? Not starting a fight here, just looking for reasoning.</br>  <br>Does it have all the Tiger Dojo and special ending if I just read HF?</br>  <br>It main relates back to the issues with his relationship with Saber. Nasu is outright aware of the problem, and one of the core things Miura set out to do with the UBW anime was to change people's opinions of Shirou due to that initial first impression.<br><br>Miura: The content of Fate/Stay Night should be assembled to follow the vector introduced by Fate/Zero, we are following that logic. If we succeed things should become interesting.<br>There is one more thing, from the time I received the post of director I decided one thing.<br>That is to draw precisely the character who is Emiya Shirou.<br>Shirou who is incomplete as a magician and doesn't possess any worthwile talent in the first stage of the story, adding to that Saber who is tied to an incomplete summoning, who doesn't receive enough mana and who can't fight at full strength.<br>Despite this while claiming to Saber "Women shouldn't fights", he still throw himself in the frontine.<br>Drawing him like this could make him a very annoying character with one wrong move.<br>But playing the original game I realized he wasn't just an idiot who wanted to become a hero, but someone who's heart is warped somewhere.<br>Why did he become this way, by understanding and despiting this I'm sure he could become a very attractive protagonist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there really any reason to play through besides the H scenes</br>  <br>There's a Tiger Dojo for every bad end in the game, so you'll only get a third or playing through HF. And the Last Episode is an epilogue for Fate, which has no bearing and makes no sense with HF's story.</br>  <br>What? /a/ sucks Fate's dick. <br><br>Overrated as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> And the Last Episode is an epilogue for Fate, which has no bearing and makes no sense with HF's story. <br>So I have to reread Fate to get it?</br></br>  <br>Rin is the only good thing in Fate route.</br>  <br> even nasu himself knows that he's a hack </br>  <br>You need to get all 40 Tiger Dojos and the 5 endings, across all routes.</br>  <br>Nope. She does seem more "mature."<br><br>Here's why I think this:<br>1) This scene is a hypothetical scene after the Fate route in which Saber decided to stay apparently.<br>2) Some time had passed from the end of the 5HGW<br>3) Saber fully accepted her womanhood and sexuality<br>4) Saber loves Shirou and gives her all to him in that regard<br>5) The whole scene is orchestrated by Saber for maximum pleasure</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate is the name for Saber's route. If you're the OP asking, or someone new to the VN, just read all of the routes. It's a novel before being a dating sim or eroge.</br>  <br>It is interesting to note some of the subtle things the anime did to make Shirou look appealing.<br><br>For instance, did anyone else notice that the anime made absolutely no reference to the fact that Shirou limited Saber in terms of power, or in the fact that Shirou was causing her problems due to not being able to regenerate mana for her? That whole thing was completely off the table in the UBW anime.</br></br></br>  <br>H scenes are only icing man. The story is gold. But if you don't like story-driven shit, character development, things like that, then you're better off with something else.<br><br><br>I don't think that he was a retard though, thats just him coming off as annoying to readers who don't like to read stuff about men telling women they can't do X. And wasn't his warped-ness explained in Fate? I don't think it was something that was necessarily 'out of left field' so to speak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The H scenes aren't a reason to play it. They're all pretty goofy, cringeworthy and lack voice acting.</br>  <br>There's this jarring disconnect where Shirou can't put his trust in a superhuman servant who is far stronger and more capable than him in the Fate route, but then come time for Unlimited Blade Works, and then suddenly Shirou has no problem trusting Rin and thinking she can handle herself.<br><br>It all comes back to the fact that Nasu had trouble writing a relationship between Saber and Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not OP, I have read Fate and UBW before but then my laptop shit on me and I have to get a new one, somehow I got the realta nua which has 3 route separated so my question is can I just read HF and got the last ending too?</br></br>  <br>The major difference is that in Fate, when Saber fights Berserker, Shirou sees her get brutalized and driven into a corner.</br>  <br> thats just him coming off as annoying to readers who don't like to read stuff about men telling women they can't do X <br>Nah, he's being an absolute blockhead telling his servant not to fight and inanely trying to do it himself when it's completely obvious that he can't handle the task.</br></br>  <br>No. You need to get everything again, unfortunately.</br>  <br>I get that, but the fact that she's going up against these types of guys in the first place shows she's a little above regular dudes.<br><br>Also doesn't the same shit happen in HF, and it doesn't really play out the same? With UBW, the Berserker fight was different, but it was 100% copy and pasted in the third route from the first.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess the first time I read it I saw it as Shirou basically trying to pull an Atlas, with Saber and his issues being 'the world' and him just chugging along trying to keep it all up. This route seems like him doing what he can as long as he can, before realizing its ok to look at the person next to him and say 'Ok, yeah, there's no harm in you lending a shoulder'. <br><br>Also this <br>he has constant flashbacks to how much he hated that moment and goes full smile protect mode, which I actually enjoyed. Especially with the dynamic if Saber being way better than him in essentially every combat aspect.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just keep skipping to next choice, it doesn't take terribly long.</br>    <br>Still not as cute as Sakura.</br>  <br>post more saber pls.</br>    Prisma is 31 hours away.  <br>I liked this scene too.</br>  Shirou shops at Whole Foods.  <br>Wait a blood sucking second.<br><br>That HF CG in the bottom left corner.<br><br>That's from an RN scene, isn't it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Well fuck.<br><br>Not a good sign, is it?</br></br></br>  no its much worse  <br>Anyone got idea what they used to replace the wet dream episode with Rider Rin?</br>  <br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/5907-Plot-Without-Porn-Let-s-<wbr>Play-R%C3%A9alta-Nua-s-H-less-Scene<wbr>s-Image-Heavy-%28Third-HF-Scene-pos<wbr>ted%29<br><br>Knock yourself out.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Has anyone read both the original and Realta Nua versions of F/SN? Having read the RN version of the Ruins scene made me consider reading through RN next time since that dragon seems pretty cool. Overall, though, which one has the better scenes?</br>  <br>Honestly, for me I'm kind of neutral to them at this point.<br><br>I was initially really against the use of the dolphin scene in the UBW anime, because I feel it robbed the viewer of a proper culmination to Rin and Shirou's relationship, but with the epilogue, which went far and above to hammer that in, I can look at things a little more objectively. I now find it to be a nice little scene where, after a route of Rin looking into Shirou, finding out more about him, Shirou gets to look into Rin. That works, I get that.<br><br>At the same time though, some people just think the replacement scenes are just kind of dumb. I still wholly agree about that with HF. I think finger sucking is dumb.</br></br></br></br></br>  In HF, was the plan always to use Rule Breaker to seperate Sakura from Avenger? I feel like it kinda came out of nowhere, and I'm hoping It's just because I had been reading non stop from 11 to 6  <br>The sex scenes are kinda awkward to read, but I read through them originally because i felt like I was going to miss out on a part of the story reading the RN version. <br><br>Having read the RN scenes, i'd say the worst thing about them is that Shirou and his heroine don't reach quite the same place in their relationship and some of the replacement scenes are just as awkward.<br><br><br>pic related is the one RN scene I'm really hoping they adapt in the HF movie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which ones?</br>  <br>My god, imagine if the ANN landwhales knew of this.</br>  <br>Does Shirou have a teddy bear in his grocery bag?</br>  <br>Which ones are just as awkward? I was really only thinking of the HF ones like  was talking about.</br>  <br>I see.<br><br>What's your opinion on Fate's H-scene replacements?</br></br></br>  <br>this is doing things to my dick</br>    <br>The first RN scene It fits a little bit better than the sex scene and the art isn't half bad. The only thing about that scene that I don't like is that Shirou is now weaker than he was in the original route. Not that it makes a difference in the story.<br><br>The second RN scene is pretty good. Just Shirou and Saber being cute together and I feel like its makes a good replacement for the h-scene while still showing proof of their relationship.<br><br>I also just realized there is some info in that first RN Fate scene that is relevant in HF. Didn't realize it the first time reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber looks so cute right there! I wanna see her dressed like that more often.</br>    Question: Who has that large screencap of a late thread Shirou x Saber x Francis Drake fanfictioning?  <br>I've never bought an anime figurine, but I've been thinking about maybe getting a Saber one. Will I have crossed a line I can never come back from?</br>  <br>It depends on how much you like Saber.</br>    <br>No, but it isn't nearly as good as TM fags make it out to be. It's entry level shit, which is hilarious considering how defensive they get about it.</br>  <br> wormslut <br> cute </br></br>  <br><br>everything /a/ hates is good<br>everything /a/ likes is bad<br><br>it should be common sense by now</br></br></br></br></br>  nero &gt;&gt;&gt; arthuria  <br> post swimsuit nameless servant vs archer </br>  <br>Not enough to call her my waifu so maybe I'm safe for now.<br><br>Any fans of the OST in here? I really like some of the songs from the vn like: This Illusion, Emiya, New Dawn, Sorrow, Ever-present Feelings, etc.</br></br></br>      <br>Mordred has the best armor design (minus the helmet)</br>  <br>oh lol, archers face in pannel 1<br><br>"WTF IS GOING ON"</br></br></br>  <br>The helmet is great too.</br>  I really wish Type Moon would move onto something completely and expand the Nasuverse rather than rehashing the Fate series over and over again.  <br>Nasu's been trying to, but everyone just wants more Fate. He's the one who put out Mahoyo and is trying to put out the Tsukihime remake.</br>  <br>completely new*</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FTr<wbr>pJUvNy-M</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I feel the same way, but apparently they wanna milk fate till it's dry. I'm hoping mahoyo will get me my Type Moon fix if a translation ever comes out.</br>  <br>Same.<br><br>I hope they do a futuristic setting or even something set during medieval times for their next work.</br></br></br>  <br>Personally I would want to see more stuff related to the Church and/or Dead Apostles.</br>  No, it's only because /a/ is filled with moe babies whose only criterion for good anime is:<br><br> appeals to paedophiles <br> has an all female cast <br><br>Whereas Fate has a mixed cast with well written characters with strong motivations. It also has good action, another thing that /a/ hates. Read the FSN VN too, it goes more into depth about all the gruesome details than the anime does. Also FZ LN. That almost as good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Futuristic setting <br><br>That sounds interesting. So something like  Shadowrun  but with servants?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah this is kinda what I'm hoping for. Maybe with a more legitimate magus or church protagonist.</br>  <br> servants using anything other than their magic weapons </br>  <br>Shirou always recognizes Saber is superior to him in ability and has no problem letting her fight for him in Fate until she almost dies against Assassin since that's now the second time he's seen her almost die. Remember that dead end 3 happens because Shirou and Saber both agree to storm the temple together I.e. he let's her fight for him.</br>  <br>The hell? Did Deadpool just give Daredevil a gatling gun?</br>  <br>No its Spiderman giving the Flash a solid projectile dispenser</br>  <br>No, Fate is confirmed classic.</br>  <br>Yes. It's still a must read for people who want to get into VNs though.</br>  <br>I didn't do any Tiger Dojos and still got Last Episode.</br>  bump for the best girl  <br> So is Arc, who is even worse than Saber. </br>  <br>I could never understand how she learned how to pleasure a man.</br>  <br> Not Gawain or Siegfried </br>  <br>Siegfried is too overdesigned for my taste but Gawain has the 2nd best armor design in Fate.<br><br> pic related is the best </br></br></br>  <br> ifunny.com </br>  <br>Yeah, basically things that made people hate the situation in the VN, IF they only watched the anime like the filthy secondaries that they are, wouldn't know of that. So if you actually liked the UBW anime and "muh MC" shit, it only proves you're of shit taste that haven't read the VN at all.</br>  Still a neat cover.  <br>Shirou is a good character regardless, the point I was making was the anime carefully handled some things that might turn off a group of people who might have already been predisposed to dislike this character. <br><br>It also didn't really change the plot in any way.</br></br></br>    Can't believe this bait thread is still up.<br><br>Guess mods delete shitposting when it comes to SAO (something they like) only.</br></br>      <br>Soon.</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br> Implying that I didn't get it from some anon on /a/ </br>  <br>I...  didn't like Fate/Zero much at all. </br>  <br>It's not about Zero, it's about Berserker. The only half decent thing to come out of Zero.</br>  <br>Can you get even more retarded with the armor?<br>Also let me guess, he wields one of the million sister swords of Excalibur.</br></br>  <br>What did Zero Berserker do recently?</br>  <br>REEEEEEEEEEEEE a lot</br>  <br>dat jeanne does things to my dick</br>  <br>I think her cow boobs look stupid.</br>  <br>Quite average</br>  <br>It's a recycled Arcueid route.</br>    <br>post team daddy issues<br> <br>you are stupid</br></br></br>          <br>mordreds sword isn't related to excalibur.<br><br>http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sabe<wbr>r_of_Red<br>http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Clar<wbr>ent</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>    <br><br>How would they interact with each other even?</br></br>    <br>if that shiro is the same as fate route shiro.<br>mordred would kill him herself the first time he calls her a girl or tries to protect her</br></br>  If you could choose your own stand what would it be?  is there any proof pucci isn't just talking through his stand?  D4C would be my ideal stand can go into any dimension and interact with no consequences really and save me from danger if need be. Love the design too and he can still punch. Besides that king crimson would be my other choice but theres a lot I'd be fine with having.  <br>Name: Looking Glass<br>Manifests as a ludicrously decorated flashlight. Needs to be shone like a flashlight <br>Can<br>(a) Reveal over peoples stands to people without stands, allows bystanders to watch sick ass stand fights<br>(b) Reveal someones true character/intentions, so if a man is scamming some kid, that kid would see how sleezy he is</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no punch ghost with laser vision <br><br>come on man, fighting spirit, remember?</br></br></br>  <br>That is one terrible stand. I guess (b) might have some uses if you're in a position of power and you can see if someone is lying to you or not.</br>  You wouldn't a cat.  <br>Panties. She's obviously not wearing any of her own.</br>  <br>Sticker with beetles on them.</br>  <br>Slick hard dick. <br><br><br>WRONG</br></br></br></br>  <br>How did she know I walk around with panties?</br>  <br/>  The new dragon ball reminded me that I feel really bad for Videl.<br>She likes Gohan because he was the cool fighter who defeated Cell, but Gohan is actually a massive faggot who hates to fight.<br>If only she had been born 2 decades before, Goku could have ended with her instead of that insufferable bitch called Chi-Chi.</br></br>  <br> laughing mexican <br>He's a southern Spaniard with a pretty unique accent, though.</br></br>  <br>that shit got on my nerves when they add a track to something that didnt have a track in the original</br>  <br>I agree a loli is better than an oldhag.</br>  <br>What was that video from again? Id like to watch it again.</br>  <br>It just a temporary love. I bet it's just like bulma nature to be playboy is inherited to trunks.</br></blockquote>]
