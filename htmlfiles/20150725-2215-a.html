[ Onii-chan!<br><br>Daisuki~</br></br>  ORE NO TURN  <br>MAGIKKU CADOO</br>  <br>Thank you, Ruri-chan~</br>  <br>WATASHI NO TAAN</br>  Neo-  <br>What happened to alladin again ?</br>  <br>Time for Fudo no Dyeuru on Motorbikes.</br>  <br>-s SHOKAN!</br>  <br>He got carded.</br>  <br>Carded</br>  As a longtime browser of /dng/, and a somewhat new browser of the ARC-V thread here on /a/, what's with the animosity between the two threads? Whenever someone says something that the posters largely disagree with, /dng/ has been directing people to the /a/ thread. But when the do the same thing here, they redirect them to /dng/. <br><br>I'm just wondering if there was some sort of conflict between the two threads, or if SOMETHING happened, here. I've honestly been out of the loop for a while.</br></br>   not posting the best girl for a new thread. <br>its like you fags dotn even care anymore.</br>  WHEN?    <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Pixiv makes it hard for me to take Yuri seriously some times. They seem to like the idea that he's obsessed with mochi.</br>  <br>/a/rc-v talks about the anime and some times about the card game which can go on with out people fling shit on each other and say X card is better that X card, from what ive seen people in arc-v thread are some what nicer than that shit-hole /dng/, while as people who ENJOY playing pet decks &amp; having fun /dng/ is where fun goes to die.</br>  <br>If you wanna talk about Nationals or Regionals go to /dng/.<br><br>If you wanna talk about the mysteries of the Ruris, post here.<br><br>Above all else don't be a meta-posting faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll get her spot light soon. Right now it's bikers, samurai and ninja time.</br>  <br>We like to have fun here.<br>You like to be insufferable tryhard tripfags there.</br></br>  <br>Soon after Gon v. Crow.<br>Now if you were referring to when we'll see Reira's smile in-show I couldn't say. That expression is Kaiba Ultra Parallel Rare</br></br>  <br>But the best girl was posted in the OP</br>  <br>In all my time on /a/ I never knew what true love was like until Serena. <br><br>I understand Yuya and Shun's pain of no Ruri.</br></br></br>  <br>Because when /dng/ is bad, as of the recent banlist, it dissolves into mostly shitposting and elitism, and usually a combination of both, like how anything that isn't apparently Nekroz, Qlis, Shaddolls, BA, or Tellars is a rogue petdeck that can't win shit and shouldn't even be played. <br><br>Not everyone at /dng/ is like that, but a lot of them are, whether it's shitposting or not.<br><br>Meanwhile we just argue between who has Serena, Fusion vs. Xyz, and Ruris.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like I'll fit right in, then.<br><br>Trips seem to be dwindling nowadays. Coincidentally, so is post quality, but, eh, fair point.<br><br><br>Sorry, that'll be the last of that from me. I appreciate the help.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Selena is love, selena is life<br> tfw you'll never find a girl like her ever, only in your dreams. </br></br>  <br>I want to commit a crime.</br>  <br>Post Yuri</br>  <br> tfw had dreams about her already <br> tfw not even that is consistent  <br><br>Suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br> As a longtime browser of /dng/ <br>Stopped reading right there.

The author who made that great YuyaXYuzu one that was translated also is releasing this.</br>  <br> Serena will never hug me like that <br>Also<br> trips  <br> trio <br><br>Good job.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see Serena enslave Yuri.</br>    http://exhentai.org/g/813747/4f79ac<wbr>1776/</wbr>  <br>It's alright Sawatari, we know Serena only has eyes for you, and that you're a good boy and good snack butler.</br>  <br> not exhentai link <br>You were already wrong, but you're also a faggot.</br></br>  <br>Has she even said his name, once. I think the only people she's called by name are Reiji and Yuzu.</br>  <br> implying anyone will ever love Sawatari <br> except for me </br></br>  <br>False.</br>  <br>She told him to calm down once and he calmed down, who else is capable of that? Outside of Reiji and Shun, Sawatari has had the most interaction with her. <br><br>Everyone loves Sawatari, everyone. Underworld Troupe when?</br></br></br>  <br>Reiji and Serena are meant for each other.</br>  <br>You stop right there Akaba Reiji.</br>  So much Yuri love, /a/ cannot resist the perfection of fusion dimension  <br>i dont like him, he's annoying</br>  <br>Watch the manzais with him, they're actually really adorable.</br>  So, accurate?  <br>They have cute boys and a crude Ruri, what's not to like?</br>  <br>Depends on what decks people on /a/ use, from what I seen a few of them would be fine.</br>  <br> fusion <br> perfect <br> not Standard </br></br></br>  ruri  <br>i use these two<br> spellbook with synchro spellcasters  <br> Ritual Beast <br>:^)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you.</br>   Judai will never appear again and interact with the people of Academia, Serena, or Yuya because people don't want the previous MCs to return <br> not even as Supreme King <br><br>Life is suffering</br></br></br>  <br>The only working deck I have right now is Prophecy, and we all know how that turned out.<br>So, probably.</br></br>  What band/singer would you like for the next OP?  <br>FLOW</br>  <br>Ruri?</br>  <br>nice Ancient Gears ;)</br>  <br>I'd love for Supreme King Judai to appear, but he'd completely and utterly overshadow Leo as nothing more than a minion.</br>   4K realizes the dub OP is shit <br> 4K lets the community vote on a band to perform the new OP <br>Who would you vote for?<br>I'd think Zebrahead would do a great job.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a minor character. We all are.<br>They would pull some combo on you and you will be sealed into a cardboard prison</br></br>  <br>Petit Milady.</br>  <br>Tommy Heavenly6, BACK-ON, or Sambomaster.</br>  <br> When Yuri falls, Leo's last resort is Supreme King Judai <br> Judai and Yuya have a duel in their Supreme King modes for maximum edge <br><br>That would be extremely entertaining</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish they would do that again. Hyperdrive and Ride to Survive were too good for their own good.</br>  <br>I'd at least be an antagonist for one of the Lancers to take down.</br>  smoll &amp; not so smoll  <br>The God of War shall not lose.</br>  <br>Yugi is such a fucking manlet.</br>  <br>I wonder what deck Yuri plays, I hope it's bugs</br>  <br>I would pee myself if that happened. Too bad they're busy perfoming for mainstream anime.</br>  <br>What if I play Vampires with Plaguespreader for Synchros and Dragon's Mirror for Dragonecro? I'd be cool and using all the summoning methods!</br>  <br>I want Yuri to card me.</br>  <br>How can Jack be so tall if he only eat instant ramen as a child.</br>  <br>That or grim m  fairy tales.</br>  <br>Why is Yuri so perfect?</br>  <br> Jack's old duel disk <br>One job.</br></br>  <br>Kaiba and Jack are all the way on the right away from the manlets.</br>  <br>Pure Aryan genetics.</br>  <br>I dont think he was able to have it often, they were poor so it was an occasional treat</br>  Are there actually Tuner monsters in the world of Zexal?<br>Scrap Hunter appears in Zexal and it mentions Tuner monster.</br>  <br>Yes please.</br>  <br>Specially if the monsters are the ends of the tales, which all know almost all of them end miserable or dead.</br>  <br> Evilswarm </br>  <br>Yes, but everyone circlejerks XYZ SHOKAN as kind of the best thing around.<br>Kaito once upon a time did a total of one fusion and one ritual summon and never did it again for instance.</br></br>  <br>Probably. Zexal probably just focused on shilling Xyzs<br> I still want Magnedragon to get a fucking print </br></br>  <br>Because his voice is sex.</br>  <br>Kaito was truly the savior of Zexal duels</br>  <br>Indeed, without him and IV the duels would have been so shit.</br>   characters in the anime create their own cards on the spot <br><br>Fuck it, I'm gonna make some fake cards and get them made. I only play with friends anyways.</br></br>  <br>but anon you hear yuuya every episode</br>  <br>Vectors antics and faces also helped.<br>Meanwhile.<br> Yuma didn't go for the actual duelist with a cat kink <br>Faaaaag</br></br></br></br>  <br>She might be the worst duelist in the history of YGO, I don't even think Rex/Weevil were that bad.</br>  <br> wanting a buttplug wearing slut </br>  <br>Ya know I always got the sneaking suspicion she was a buttplug kind of girl too.</br>  <br>But she actually dueled.<br>Actually hell, I tried out cat deck on Tag Force Special, it's really not a bad deck since you can easily end up with a casual 4000 attack monster.<br><br><br> not wanting a devoted cat slut <br> not wanting one that breaks into your own house to suck your dick. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying you wouldn't be part of Fusion's Anti-Academia Movement using Heros  <br><br>Obelisk Force uses Antique Gears, it makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, that reminds me-- do you have that GIF of Vector laughing at Durbe and Rio, as the LP meter showed up, displaying he still had 4000 life points? I can't for the life of me find it.<br><br><br>Actually, Rex and Weevil basically faced each other in the finals of a tournament that was, essentially, a Nationals. (Rex won, but in-canon they were supposedly good.)<br><br><br>If you need help with PSCT, let us know. I know that, at the very least, I could help.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cathy would have been best girl if the ass was actually that fat</br>  <br>Yuya doesn't say things like "This game of tag is over"  in the way that gets my panties wet. </br>  <br>She'll grow into it.<br>Just like Anna.</br></br>  <br>Would Academia even realize it if I don't shuffle my cards and just arrange them in an order that lets me 1 turn kill them?</br>  <br>no fusions are pretty dumb, you could probably make up a monster effect and say the duel disk is busted and they'll believe you</br>  <br>Just keep synchro summoning, eventually they'll get bored and just wander away.</br>  <br>it took a while but I salvaged it.</br>  <br>Sweet, thanks!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br>Genuinely made me angry.<br>Cuckfags need to die.<br><br><br>Ah crap, I'm letting my /b/ out again.</br></br></br></br></br>  I just heard that the shonen jump volume with frightfur tiger in it is out, anyone know when they'll start hitting the secondary market?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br>As I write this, my duel monsters cards are on the desk, Gekidan Niagara is on the stereo, and my Yuzu is in another dimension on a date with a guy named Yugo. If it goes like the others, she'll come home in the middle of the night, and tell me about how she and Yugo tag duled against an oppressive seemingly amoral force of no more than three security grad. I won't explode with anger or seethe with resentment. I'll tell her it's a great story and i'm glad she had fun. It's great because she's excited, and I',m glad because I'm a lancer.</br>  <br>guards*</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br> mfw I looked up the full article </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br>sincerely made me sick. why did you post that.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br> Paulo <br> o <br>That one letter made it much worse.</br></br></br>  Clear Mind vs Shining Draw. Who wins?  <br>Clear Mind summons Quasar which blows everything out of the water so you tell me</br>  I wish there was a ritual user in the cast. I get to hear Fusion,synchro, xyz and pendulum shokans nearly every episode but only once did I see a ritual summon and it was a shitty loli gag character nobody likes.  <br>ritual summons are useless though</br>  http://challonge.com/tomo11<br><br>time for another animu tourney, this time it's ZEXAL!<br><br> so will Gongenzaka or Crow win?  </br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br>And somehow this is less offensive than the gays getting married? Whatever, open marriage sounds like a half assed way of saying they want to date and fuck other people but no so much they are willingly to risk funds and reputation destruction on divorce proceedings.</br>  <br>You need Over Top Clear Mind to summon Quasar, regular Clear Mind just makes Shooting Star. Pretty sure Yuma could Shining Draw a ZW that ups a Hopes attack by half the attack of a monster it battles, and makes it unable to activate effects when its attacked or whatever</br>  <br>But then if he summons Shooting Star, Yuma wont have time to Shining Draw because he will have been hit by 5(3?) Shooting Stars</br>  <br> vampires post banlist <br> It hurts... </br></br>  <br>Yuma summons a Number in defense mode, and Shooting Star cant kill it (since its not a Number). Or when he'd direct attacks for game, Yuma summons Numeron Dragon from his extra</br>  <br> Yuma summons a Number in defense mode, and Shooting Star cant kill it (since its not a Number). <br>Ah yes, the true bullshit that is ZEXAL</br></br>  Whats you're  SHOKAN  theme?  <br> the true bullshit that is ZEXAL <br>except yusei has junk archer and drill warrior.<br><br>besides, yugi managed to beat astral.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  unreleased ridingu duel  <br>theme..isn't that Yugo's theme?</br></br>  <br>I think he meant the Numbers can't be killed by Numbers thing<br><br>That was bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>who summoned nothing but hope.</br>  <br>I'm aware, but yusei has outs to that.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128547274 <br> just reading that pic tells me alot about the man, dude's a fucking bitch and that woman is a filthy whore. <br><br>i just want an Episode of the best girl and how she goes on in here every day life and the discoveries she comes across like ice cream,cake not undressing in front of other people and finding strong people to become lancers.</br></br></br>  Remember that Shun vs Sora caused Arc-V to get canceled because Siscon man carpet bombed the city. I can't wait to see how they change his attack from Revolution Air Raid.  <br>source?</br>  <br>They will probably re edit that whole scene</br>  <br>It wasn't cancelled, it's because they threw all the budget there.</br>  <br>source fagtron.</br>  <br><br>He doesnt have one.

What you’re referring to as Ruri is in fact, XYZ/Ruri, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, XYZ plus Ruri.

I swore that I will stick to my Steadfast Dueling style no matter what! <br><br> Yuya: That’s going to be pretty difficult, considering that you’re having a Riding Duel with Crow. <br><br> GONGENZAKA: I WON’T EVEN MOVE A STEP, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY! <br><br> Yuya: Then how are you going to perform a Riding Duel? You will have to move… <br><br> GONGENZAKA: WHAT!? NOOOOOOOOO! I’m sorry, FATHERRRRRRRRR! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh Gon, if only you can just park the bike from the start.</br>  <br>I just imagine Gon standing still and just wait for Crow to come back to play, it will be a really long duel. Or run like Jose did in 5D</br>  <br>Why would you post fucking Linkara?</br>  <br>All that's left is for Gon to pick up an Action Card to protect Yuya and his father will disown him</br>  <br> Run like Jose <br>If anyone could pull that off, it'd be Gon.</br></br>  <br>John 15:13 anon.....John 15:13</br>  i really cannot imagine Gon using a bike, he is the least character that could ever use one, unless someone rides it for him and he just stands steadily  <br>I remembered that picture and thought it was relevant to this thread</br>  <br>who the fuck is linkara?</br>  <br>some guy who reviews comic books on some shitty website /</br>  <br>disgusting, dude uses a E-Hero deck.</br>  <br> Tsukikage drives Gon's bike, while he stands on the back. <br> Tsukikage drives Reira's bike, while he sits in a sidecar. <br> Tsukikage draws Yuya's bike while he goes YUUUZUUUU </br></br></br>  <br>I find Shinji's design offensively average.

Younger(teens-30), would be into Miia, some Rachnee as well(but moreso than the over 30s).<br><br>So far, the results seem to say my theory is pretty sound.</br></br> <br><br> The way I see it, Cerea appeals to older guys who are content with an occasional roll in the hay, plenty of soft romance, especially   hand-holding , while the younger crowd are more into the idea of prolonged/large amounts of sex/orgies, and/or femdom which Each and Miia represent.<br><br>So what do you guys think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think most of them would be okay with that</br>  <br>Its segways into introducing Rachnee so theres very little chance of it being OVAd</br>  <br><br>Literally the dumbest idea ever proposed.</br></br>  <br>Female birds are maternal as fuck dude, what are you on?</br>  <br>Beastiality</br>  <br>Official monster girl cuddling power levels<br><br>1.

I was actually more curious about how their personalities speak to different age groups.

Sorry about Shitpost-san taking over. The original intended statement, was that each girl's respective personalities had specific appeal to certain demographics. Miia's passionate, borderline-obsessive possessiveness appealing to a younger crowd. Rach being the cooler, older sister(alternately, defrosting ice-queen), I would have thought appealed to the older crowd(but seems to be mid-range). Cerea seemed more like the sort older gentlemen might prefer, with simpler(if lewder) needs like  hand-holding  with regards to companionship, compared to the other two.<br><br>For the Papi-fag, sorry, you're the only one of your kind to respond.

Her childlike innocence is appealing, although maybe the older crowd, despite all the talk about wanting an imouto, probably find her a little too draining. Like, I enjoy playing with kids, even teaching them stuff, but Papi is a little too immature(ironic, I know), and I guess frustrating, when you have to explain something to her for the umpteenth time, because she got impatient and walked a few steps.</br></br></br>    <br>This makes my heart penis erect.

"no fuck me!".<br>Then there are hard harems where the guy is literally giving them all the dick.<br><br>But Monster Musume tows the line and I don't think it works.<br>Having a girl licking your nipple then another one bursting in botomless and about to fuck you then another bursting in and forcibly placing your hand on her tits...it's just not compelling.<br>And the whole time the MC has a stupid o_0 look on his face.<br><br>I know a lot of fans disagree with me, but I think if this series had the same characters but teased out the sex appeal more subtly it would have been amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>    <br> And the whole time the MC has a stupid o_0 look on his face. <br>Which has been the way Darling has been drawn since the first issue of the manga.

Get on my level.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a time when it's his birthday but no one celebrate it. And in end of the day he said to his friend that today is supposed to be his birthday. And everybody don't know how to react.<br><br>It's so painful to hear that</br></br></br>  <br>Wow. When I remember Sugita or Iguchi talk about best friend this or best friend that, I now understand how much of a big thing having a best friend is, especially for a Japanese adult.</br>  No one talks about girls like Megumi Nakajima... really... why? She is beautiful, she has amazing voice and people shit on her, because she voiced Ranka in Macross Frontier.<br><br>I wish she would come back to voice acting, but at the same time I hope she is fine and I will wait for her return.

I find having other people around is kind of a pain in the ass.

You might have issues, bro.</br>  <br><br>I know, right? Small talk and empty words. Horrible.</br></br>    <br> You might have issues, bro. <br>Yeah, but so what? It's not like they will go away if I wish really hard.<br><br>If you expect me to bother you out of the blue every few days with some meaningless shit like then we probably won't become "friends".<br> "How was your day?" <br>Most likely the same as 99% of days, where nothing happened.

Except maybe the one voicing Kirito, him I want to dunk upside down in a barrel of  cum .</br></br>   mfw that faggot Matsuoka is gonna be the MC in the new Super Robot Wars game   <br>Really? That is sorta neat.<br>Who will be voicing the chick?</br></br>  <br>Mai Nakahara</br>  <br> including roles of anime that are ongoing <br><br>It's an arbitrary rule of mine that I wait until the anime is finished so that there are more pictures available for me to choose from and also to fully understand its impact/popularity. When a season's only 3 eps in you can't really tell if the anime (and consequently the character) is going to end up memorable or not. Though in the end it's all personal taste which characters end up in a mosaic.</br></br></br>  <br>There is something severely wrong with her facial structure.</br>  <br> that weak as shit FALBLAZE <br>It's gonna be amazingly terrible.<br>benched</br></br></br>  <br> Umehara on covers after just a couple of months working <br>Based</br></br>  <br>Miyuki Sawashiro and Haruka Tomatsu are Goddesses. They are the only reason I live</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> . She looks really cute too. <br>Anon before discovering makeup.</br></br>  <br>Glad Ari-chan is there. She's cute</br>  <br>I agree that lately they care more about looks and marketability as a personality/idol though I'm not really complaining. Personally I think seiyuu like Asami Seto, Ai Kakuma, Tomoyo Kurosawa, Ari Ozawa are all newer seiyuu with varying degrees of good range.<br><br>Seiyuu like Ayane Sakura, Maaya Uchida didn't impress me at the beginning of their career but the latter has been growing on me (she's good in Chaos Dragon, Charlotte what I've seen) and Ayane's been slightly improving over the years. HanaKana used to be bad in the beginning but she's great now (that doesn't mean I tolerate her overexposure).</br></br></br>  Is there a specific seiyuu you've been recognizing more and .more recently? For me its Hiroshi kamiya  <br>I remember the first Nico broadcast event they did for Seiken Tsukai, in which Kaito was the MC. The guest were Aoi, Taketatsu, Ogura and Uchida.<br>There was a lot of awkwardness in the air during that event. Not because there was any animosity between the cast but more due to a lack of chemistry between them, with Ogura being Ogura and Maaya Uchida having the personality of a brick.(Of course some Maaya fanboys in 2ch deconstructed this into people bullying Uchida and yada yada)<br><br>Still, despite the "bad" atmosphere Kaito really did his best at improving the mood, it left a good impression of him on a lot of of the spectators.<br>Him and Aoi pretty much carried that whole train-wreck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Ogura a bitch or something?</br>  <br>No, but she is overly fake and burikko.<br>Not a bad girl per se, but she is a huge tool of the industry.</br></br>  <br> people bullying Uchida <br>Please explain.<br><br><br>Yes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody bullied Uchida, she was putting zero effort in interacting with Aoi/Taketatsu/Ogura and therefore was left behind in conversations.<br>Then a few hours later you had dumb fanboys saying they bullied her.</br></br>  <br><br>It's been built with the latest medical technology, but something went horribly wrong.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow. I expected her to be a nice girl, but I guess you can't really judge by just looks.</br></br>  <br>Is there a prove she's burikko or fake? I don't think she's that bad.</br>  <br>Shit, mean to quote  </br>  <br><br><br>I want to marry Harami and remove her cake status!</br></br></br>  <br>She did  by makes my dick goes diamond </br>  <br>Really Anon? She puts up a fake cutesy voice everytime she speaks normally. Compare her tone of voice in an interview to pretty any other modern female seiyuu.<br>All Idol seiyuu lie about a few things but Ogura's stage personality comes of as terribly forced and fake.<br><br>Again, Ogura is not a bad per se, she is just a huge tool.<br>Last I checked she was just 19 so maybe she will find a way to be more true to herself in the future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Is she Yukarin level burikko or she's more terrible than Yukarin?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, petit milady and Kaito saved that show, but Ogura in that Niconama seems fine to me and Uchida is like always, not good at communicating</br>  <br>I always enjoy Aoi acting like a creeper around Ogura.</br>  <br>I know her cutesy voice is seems fake. but It doens't mean she's a bitch like this anon said . <br>or maybe her real voice isn't really far from her cutesy voice. Naganawa Maria have a bit similiar cutesy voice like Ogura. And to me, Maria's voice doesn't seem fake.</br></br>  <br>And Aoi not holding back againts tkt2. Oppai beeaaam.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_K0<wbr>oNlZDsYs</wbr>  [ ]<br>I love how Aoi makes her stand up first.</br></br>  <br>From what?</br>  I love Saorin  <br>It seemed like Uchida was preoccupied with something in her mind but couldn't do anything about it since she had an event to attend. You know, real life shit.  She could've also been on her period. </br>  <br>Dokkyun dokkyun.</br>  <br>It probably bothers her that she's the only slut there or something.</br>  <br>Idols don't have periods, silly.<br>Now that you mention it, she was a bit better/less awkward on the Seiken Tsukai radio CD.(With Aoi, Taketatsu and Chiaki Omigawa.)</br></br>  <br>Are you saying the jam isn't authentic?</br>  I wish we could get more of these two.  Why do producers hire expensive seiyuu when seiyuu are dime a dozen, and they can cut costs immensely by hiring newbies?<br><br>Newbies would work for basically nothing just for a chance to get exposure. Another benefit is that you don't get Kirito-voiced or Araragi-voiced MCs every single season.</br></br>  <br>Except that's a different persona with a different seiyuu so you can't really represent her as Uchida maaya at that point.</br>  <br>What? The seiyuu is still same.</br>  <br>Rieshon is really good at that. If you told me Nyaa-tan, Hotaru from NNB, and Nao from Wakaba Girl were voiced by different people, I'd believe you.</br>  <br>What the fuck. You're absolutely right.<br><br>I-I mean I was just pretending to be retarded. Jokes on you.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?<br>Despite QUALITY all over the place in anime, industry standard is still a thing</br></br>  <br>You are generalizing, plenty of no Anime with a tight budget do just what you said.(It's also the reason why you see new faces so often instead of veteran seiyuu which are more expensive. A good example is Yuri Kuma Arashi, the main trio were no-names, and the big name seiyuu like Aoi or Koshimizu only voiced secondary girls that had way less screentime.)</br>  <br>Who is this spackle castle?</br>  <br><br>I could have sworn they had different seiyuus for the split personalities, I thought I even saw it in the casting on  MAL </br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget voicing Shiho and Isla, that makes her absolute shit tier by default (more so at the former)</br></br>  <br>Rainy Sky.</br>  <br>Who is this hardening agent?<br><br><br>Who is this nut-butter erupter?<br><br><br>Thanks. I just woke up and they're coming to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most newbies are not that good.<br>Believe it or not in this industry the majority of popular seiyuu deserve they popularity.</br></br>  <br>Even Hanazawa, Anon?</br>  <br>Or Minami Tsuda?</br>  <br>She's a great seiyuu. Only a bit below Hayami/Sawashiro (the bestests young seiyuu).</br>  <br> Sawashiro <br>Pure talent, not so much skill. Just has a voice like sex.</br></br>  <br>Hanazawa has good range, she can show the personality and share emotion through her voice.<br>She is a bit overrated, but almost anyone would be with the amount shows she is in per season.<br><br><br>She isn't popular, she just got lucky last year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you mean why don't they do that faster than the rate they usually do? Because that's exactly what they do, almost every 3-4 years we're seeing another group of late teens/early 20 year olds debuting while those that have reached cake status get cast less and less</br>  <br>No. Uchida voiced both of them. You could clearly hear Uchida's voice in Onee-san voice. She use her cool deep voice.<br>and why the hell they used different seiyuu when the character is sharing same body.</br></br>  <br> No. Uchida voiced both of them. You could clearly hear Uchida's voice in Onee-san voice. She use her cool deep voice. <br>I've never heard her use that voice, ever. Could you give me some other roles when she has?</br></br>  <br>Great range while still being recognizable.<br>She's like female Ishida.</br></br>  <br> Hanazawa has good range, she can show the personality and share emotion through her voice. </br>  most underrated with great range  <br>yet what a terrible nose</br>  <br> half-breeds </br>  <br> She isn't popular, she just got lucky last year. <br>Got lucky? How?<br>Isn't there a list of the top earning seiyuu with her ranking high up there.</br></br></br>  <br>Meant to reply <br><br>Hanazawa is great, I rated her higher after her performance in Garden of Words.<br>She's brilliant there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The most recent one she used her cool voice is Dora-tan in Etotama.</br>  <br>Any others?</br>  <br>Her Nibutani was great, and she's still my Kyoanifu until now.</br>  <br>Who is this load toad?<br><br><br>Who is this priapism mechanism?<br><br><br>Who is this gestation plantation?<br><br><br>Who is this friction addiction?<br><br><br>Who is this fornication station?<br><br><br> great range <br>Not really, no</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How many roles has she this year?<br>Like two to four at most.<br>She can't be earning so much.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to filter you because you're trying too hard with those names.</br>  <br>Sawashiro can easily pull do children to adult male greatly, and you can still recognize her voice.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>The emotion she showed in the movie is great, but range? it is not at all</br>  <br>I don't remember any other character when she used cool voice. May be NotHomu from Vividred, but I think it's not deep like dora-tan or that split personality. You can just check  MAL  anon.</br>  <br>Wait, she was not-homu from vividass? whut.</br>  <br>Also filtered because <br> Sawashiro doesn't have skill </br></br>  Cmon guys, if Hanazawa had a "great range" her overexposure a few years ago wouldn't have been an issue. But she couldn't cover all those roles so it ends up sounding like she gets mis-casted and the role could have gone to a better suited seiyuu. You don't see people complaining about Aoi Yuuki or Sawashiro being everywhere.<br>She has her forte, which is soft-spoken character then she can vary it a bit (smug/insane in particular she is pretty good at). Great range is a stretch.</br>  <br>There are many unnoticeable ones with good range</br>  <br><br>Range is overrated anyway.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't only do anime role. I think she did the dub for GoT as well. No idea how legit this list is.</br>  <br>Yes. Honestly, Uchida is pretty good at voice acting or maybe talented, but some anon here just called she's slut just because she's do gravure before become a popular seiyuu like now.</br>  <br>Not like some other leading seyuu. Like I said, she has a voice like sex, and she delivers her lines well, but she doesn't have the range.</br>  <br>She's a very talented semen demon.</br>  <br> she has a voice like sex <br>She sounds like a grandmum to me.</br></br>  Who should be the next guest on Tokyo Encounter?<br><br>Also, where are the fucking subs? This isn't the Red October, fuck.</br></br>  <br>Which was a big mistake.<br>She's a weird(?) type who looks good only with clothes on.</br></br>  <br>She's even doing more gravure after she got popular as seiyuu.<br>Funny how Mao started to dress like a granny after she was gaining more roles as seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>I remember someone mentioned that Aoi's manager was pushing her to become idol type seiyuu. What happened to it?</br>  <br>You are gonna need to be more specific than that.</br>  <br>Problem is her legs is short, makes her bikini photos looks weird from waist below.<br>Unlike Tomatsu, who has a great pair of legs even though her ass and chest are almost non-existent.</br></br>  <br>This season in Chaos Dragon, she voices Urobuchi's character.<br><br><br>Nana Mizuki can single-handedly carry an anime thanks to her large fanbase. Having veteran seiyuu also pays off when it comes to events.<br><br><br>The way seiyuu industry is becoming more looks-oriented I wouldn't be surprised if doing gravure becomes more regular, see Haruka Tomatsu. Releasing a photobook is a good way to gain some money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;This season in Chaos Dragon, she voices Urobuchi's character. <br>I would watch it for her but I CD seems pretty dull.<br>I only watched 1 ep though.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I haven't heard anything about her activity as an idol nowadays. She seems to degrade as fujoshit and otaku as one of Sugita's friends (which is great) instead of releasing singles/albums like Hanazawa did before</br>  <br>Hiyori was voiced by Uchida? What the fuck?</br>  You will never have a threesome with these two. Ever.  <br>No idea where can she be earning so much.<br>All that money doesn't come from her seiyuu job, that's sure.<br>I don't know how good of a singer she is, so maybe there it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you always skip anime ED?</br>  <br><br><br>I swear to god, I could have fucking sworn that she wasn't. I think someone must have tampered with my memories because it seems so obvious now but I was completely oblivious.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't that ED done by supercell from what I recall?</br>  <br>Kind of. It's another singer backed by supercell's ryo.</br>  <br>It's a shame she doesn't get more roles, Alice is the only recent one I can recall.</br>  <br>Hotaru's voice is really soothing.</br>  <br>I know, I'm always looking out for her but she ain't getting hardly shit. <br><br>Another favorite of mine. All her roles have been perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Tia as vocalis. I think he mean a credit roll in ED</br>  <br>Oonishi Saori, Ozawa Ari, Kakuma Ai. They're seiyuu that I like. And I think they have good range.</br>  <br>Female version of Matsuoka Yoshitsugu</br>  <br><br>All of NNB is soothing. It's pure undiluted smooth all the way down to the last 5%, and then it's the dark underside with all the  rape .</br></br>  Just found it on Downtown DX that Kaneda Tomoko ate 42 giant pieces of tonkatsu to celebrate her 42th birthday.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hU-<wbr>kMqV5Pco</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>And I thought Kobayashi Yuu is crazy.</br></br></br></br>  Thread needs more bullying.  <br>all female seiyuus in their 20s are idol seiyuu.</br>  <br>Veterans seiyuu are like investments. They might cost a lot but they can also bring you back a lot of money.<br>Like  said, Mizuki Nana costs quite a lot because she's literally at the top of the industry, but you can be 200% sure she'll sell like candies in a preschool because she's popular as fuck no matter how shitty the show she is in, and her CDs will sell without no doubt because her songs are good even if the show is dogshit.</br></br>  <br>Assuming they're even decently attractive.</br>  Idol ≠ Artist/Singer<br>Why does everyone call anyone who sing/dances an "idol"?</br>  <br><br>They really need to stop being so blatant about that. I feel like she could actually come into her own eventually and build her way up to leading roles with experience and time but the way they're pushing her as their leading heroine so fucking hard and in their bad anime isn't helping her at all. Especially because this way if they dump her she's probably going to be fucked.</br></br>  <br> Plastic Memories was a flop <br> Classcroom Crisis is set to be a flop <br><br>How much longer does she have?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cross Ange  immediately come to mind. I wonder how many people bought the BD just for Nana.</br>  <br>Oi, Cross Ange was a good show.</br>  <br>why do 2dpdfags care who 3dpds fuck?</br>  <br>I don't think many of them bought the BDs. Most of them blasted their cash on Kindan no Resistance and Eden.<br>I'm sure the Nanafags bought the BDs that includes episode 20-23 though. That fucking scene where Nana made lewd sounds was so arousing.</br></br>  <br>Has anyone here played Short Peace: Rango Tsukigime's Longest Day?<br><br>Uchida voices every single female character in that game, and then sings the ED. It's fucking brilliant.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't buy anything Cross Ange related, but Nana, Yukarin and Yui Horie made me watch the show.</br>  <br>1st cour was fucking gold.<br>2nd cour is shit. I only watched through the 2nd cour mostly because of Nana. You don't really get to hear Nana saying rude words that often.</br></br>  <br>I remember the time where I picked up Cross Ange because  Nana was the MC .<br>I never regretted making that choice. Those were some of the most entertaining weeks I had in my life.</br></br>  <br>Her v oice is so annoying. Does she always speak like that even in RL?</br>  <br>Yeah, it was the first time to see three of them in the same anime if I'm not mistaken. <br>That alone should generate a lot of buzz.</br></br>  <br> double blowjob  <br>With THEIR technique? Damn.</br></br>  <br>Apparently it's her natural voice, so yes.</br>  42 pieces of Tonkatsu is just crazy  <br>Why is she so autistic?</br>  <br>I always wonder why they don't make shows starring those three.<br>They're literally the Holy Trinity of the seiyuu industry, even if they cost a fortune to hire they should bring back 999x of the money lost to hire them.</br></br>  <br>I don't think CA was a huge hit. But having Nana in cast seems guarantee at least 5,000 BD/DVD.</br>  <br>Cross Ange was only a huge hit with feminists who are buttblasted because of the first episode.<br>It only sold 5K because of the top-tier VA cast, and of course Nana.</br></br>  <br>The animation would suffer a heavy backslash with all the money they cost.<br><br><br>BDs aren't accurate to judge a show success.<br>For example see Symohogear or Prisma this season, they are both in their third season but never had stellar BD sales.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> buttblasted <br>Heh.</br></br>  <br>It was really fun to see those three in one anime.<br>And two of them are in Nana`s character`s harem too, which made it more fun.</br></br>   Nana this, Nana that <br> Nana wills it.jpg </br>  <br>You called?</br>  <br>only japan cares, the west gives no shit as long as they keep voicing 2d qts</br>  <br>Just say you want more Nana, anon.</br>  <br><br>No.  Lets not derail this thread with too much Nana. </br></br>  <br><br>I want to impregnate nana.</br></br>   va threads used to only have pictures of characters <br> then they started having 3dpd next to the characters <br> now it's just 3dpd <br>when did /a/ become such cancer?</br></br></br>  <br>Nana a qt.<br><br> implying its not Nana that will impregnate you </br></br></br>  <br> /a/ gets to have seiyuu threads <br> /tv/ doesn't get to have actress threads </br></br>  <br>Now that the Nanafags are aware she's the current topic here, its destined to be bombed by Nana now.<br>Don't worry, they'll go away sooner or later like nothing happened, as that always happens.</br></br>  <br>I want Nana to marry someone already.<br>She has to pass her glorious genes.</br></br>  <br>speaking of /tv/ mark hamill has said that he doesn't want people thinking of old luke skywalker when they hear the joker. in the same way I don't want to see ugly japs when I watch my cute anime girls.</br>  <br>It can't be helped.</br>  <br>Yukarin should do the honors, it'll help with her depression.</br>  Nao Touyama is the best. I feel bad she had to voice that shitty idol in TWGOK  <br>Girls can't impregnate girls.</br>  <br>Should Mark Hamill impregnate Nana-sama?</br>  Who Kaori here?  <br>Please keep gaijins away from Nana.</br>  <br>I'll be glad to contribute then.</br>  I will impregnate Yukarin as well!  <br>The shitty idol was the foundation of her career, you fag.</br>  <br>She is one of the most successful seiyuu of all time, if not the most successful one.<br>How does she derail the thread, but Kana Hanazawa doesn't?</br></br>  <br>This Kaori (Fukuhara)<br><br>(Please hire her more)</br></br></br>  <br>You mean both of these britbong right?<br>TWGOK is a literally noname anime.</br></br>  <br>You don't underestimate Nanafags. They can be the most autistic, loyal fags you can ever see.<br>Also,  Nana wills it. </br></br>    <br>Why is she so kind?</br>  <br> pure4 <br>heh</br></br>  <br>So how does such a pure looking girl turn into such a huge slut?<br>Is this the dark side of the industry corrupting all the girls?</br></br>  Who is the most pure seiyuu now?<br><br>I dont wanna sluts here</br></br>  <br>That's depressing as fuck.<br>I will go hear to New Sensation trying to forget I read that.</br></br>  <br>The Industry has always been dark. Only strong individuals stay pure and emit radiance despite the wrongdoings of the Industry.</br>  <br>No seiyuu over age 20 is pure, fags. If they aren't married or have boyfriends they've done pillow business or just decided to take the sound director or whoever on a whim because they were feeling horny. Deal with it.</br>  <br>Amamiya Sora</br>  <br>Yukarin, but she is kind of depressed because of that.<br>Aoi maybe, she seems a big otaku after all.</br></br>  <br>Neither are those under 20 because of teenagers' sexual drive.</br>  <br>Nana`s heart is the purest.</br>  <br> Yukarin <br>Her suicide tendency is still there?<br> Aoi <br> Maybe Sugita already took hers. </br></br></br></br>  <br>At this point I won't be surprised if Nana actually dies in the middle of her concert because she tries so fucking hard to make her fans happy in her concerts.<br><br> Sugita <br> taking anyone`s virginity <br>He can't even tap Nana.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> suicide tendency <br><br>Has she reached JUST level yet?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nana is the best<br><br>Aoi too</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope she never does.</br>  <br> Her suicide tendency is still there? <br>Last thing about her was about her was a Twitter at the end of June.<br>Apparently, she was neurotic because she had a free day and didn't now what to do with it.</br></br></br>  <br> huge ear lobes <br> huge lip <br> chin too round <br>3/10 maybe if i was drunk</br></br></br></br>    <br> because she tries so fucking hard to make her fans happy in her concerts. <br>Safety first, et voila, she survives, edgemeister.</br></br>  <br>Maybe a life-long gimmick for her radio show. Kinda like Iron Sheik.</br>  <br> Apparently, she was neurotic because she had a free day and didn't now what to do with it. <br>Now I'm scared. What will she do once her career is over? Picking marriage route seems quite hard for her.</br></br>  <br>Someone help this woman already, Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>Nothing. <br>If you remove Yukarin`s job from her, it will only make her suffer more.<br>If you remove Nana`s job from her, you'll be literally stripping off her reason to live.<br>Some of the seiyuus have nothing left but their jobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not knowing Asanee </br>  <br>Your goddess has arrived.</br>  <br>stop trying to make me sad you cunt</br>  <br>Only she can help herself.<br>She has a long history of depression, no one is gonna fix it easily.</br></br>  <br> If you remove Nana`s job from her, you'll be literally stripping off her reason to live. <br>Does she really have nothing left in her life?</br></br>  <br><br>She probably has enough money to retire.</br></br>  <br>I doubt Nana retires from singing.<br>She will probably retire from anime and become an enka singer.</br></br>  <br>Or a housewife while occasionally doing anime roles in her spare time like Hayashibara.</br>  <br>We all remember her scandals of course, but does she still have health problems?</br>  <br>She was literally born to sing.<br> her name was based off an actress-singer  <br> trained to sing at the young age of 5  <br> her childhood was literally only about her tours all around Japan to join singing contests <br> even when her father died she still wants to sing and fulfill her family's dreams <br> even when she already fulfilled her family's dreams she still has her own dreams to fulfill that is still related to singing <br> her dream is wanting to sing for everyone in the world <br>If you make her stop from singing she has nothing left to do but die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or doing a rakugo comedy with Yui Horie and Yukari</br>  <br>I get a boner just thinking if she might be a screamer.</br>  <br>She never has noticable non-lead roles so far to prove herself, she won't last longer when Sony finds their new darling, and people realized that she is manufactured<br><br><br>She should take it slow after the success of Kaori in One Week Friends but it seems the agency can't wait much longer since she will be unnoticeble in supporting character roles, so they go full force in giving her so many lead roles so they can media play out of her as most sought after seiyuu in a short span time and you see after she starred in A/Z, Akame and Tokyo Ghoul which were most hyped show that season they successfully lauched her career as next big seiyuu, she gains popularity fast, it doesn't matter Sony pushed her or not since people and media already thought she is the trend and especially then Aniplex keep giving her lead roles every season to keep her status as popular VA. It is more annoying now those gives her many pleb fans who think she is in level of HanaKana and sings better than Nana.<br><br>Sony would keep giving her that lead roles until she has enough hits to keep her name out there and gain more fanbase to buy her idol stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering she really screams when freaking out when people dig up her past photos of her, its not that hard to guess she is a screamer.</br>  Erection rising.<br><br><br>The absolute best. <br><br><br>See this? Never.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this was 6 hours ago but you have a problem if you can't see that Erina is already more popular than most of those characters. Same with Rory Mercury.</br>  <br>Who is this peener steamer?<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12855555 <br>Who is this bean machine?</br></br></br></br>  <br> *</br>  <br>Best Joshiraku indeed.</br>  <br> Or a housewife <br>The odds of this are over 72034785029486790237609385674895670<wbr>394 to 1!</wbr></br></br>  How can you like seiyuus,anons?They're 3DPD shits also i like Aya Hirano.  <br>Petit Milady</br>  <br> Implying 2.5D isn't greater than 3D <br> Not all people on this board hate 3D, everyone loves 2D but some like the range of 2-3 </br></br>  <br> falling for bait </br>  <br>Funny thing they even put her together with Hanazawa on radio show.</br>    <br> (even though she isn't even beautiful) <br>But that's wrong.</br></br>  Why is this woman so popular? She isn't that good looking at that conversational voice of hers sounds annoying or fake.  <br> Implying there aren't people right now who unironically hate 3DPD </br>  <br>Erina is her most popular character so far, it's a successful adaptation of a popular Jump manga. Popularity isn't the only thing I consider, I wait til the anime is finished so I have more Erina frames to choose from. You're right that Rory will end up being popular too. I'll add both of them eventually.<br><br><br>Rie is great. I love when she's not being stereotyped as a tsundere. And every time she's in a Matsumoto anime is a treat (Koto, White).</br></br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't know her fame. <br>You would prob diss the queen of seiyuu too.  Megumi-sama. </br></br>    <br>Man, that runaway JoJo girl looks so out of place.</br>  <br> Yukana <br>Never knew about this. Can someone give me a break down?</br></br>  I want to make love to Mao  <br>Maybe when she got the role as Four in the new Zeta Gundam movies? I remember it was pretty big.</br>  <br>Good taste anon</br>  <br>I just notice Nao Touyama only has 5 leading roles since she started her seiyuu career in 2010, compare that with  who gets that many leads roles just in 2 years it made me sad.</br>  <br>Bad taste. She's seriously bad looking without the photoshop.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nU-<wbr>cJ42BqC0</wbr>  [ ]<br>10years from now, people will still remember dess and burning love.<br>On the other hand, nobody will remember that sony slut and her role in irrelevant anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Which shounen sunday was this?</br>  <br>She was really cute in Gokaiger.</br>  <br> 10years from now, people will still remember dess <br><br>But people forgot about suiseiseki already.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't.</br>  <br>I will never forget Kuwatani Natsuko.</br>  <br><br>At first I thought the right one was also Ayaneru.</br></br>  <br>i keep saying she has the nicest smile in the industry</br>  <br>y-yamete</br>  <br>yuu is the big spoon? neat</br>  guys should I make a FAQ for occasional seiyuu thread here and there?  <br>For what reason?<br>There's nothing you can make an FAQ for here.</br></br>  <br>No. You're probably going to only write about HanaKana, Yuuki Aoi, Sakura Ayane and Amamiya Sora anyway. All overrated shit.</br>  <br>This.<br>Anon will just add shit about how jerkable his favorite seiyuu is, feel free to fuck off.</br></br>  <br>I actually want to see an old, washed-up Amamiya. That would make her sort of endearing to me.</br>  <br>I miss Aki Lucky</br>  <br><br><br><br> XXX is pillow seiyuu <br> where can I find more of XXX? <br> why hasn't sugita/kobayashi  <br> why isn't this old veteran getting more roles? <br> why is this new popular cheap seiyuu getting so many roles? <br> 3dpd, reported <br><br>I wasn't going to mention specific seiyuus, just an idea of how the industry appears to work</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget about Nana and Asakawa Yuu. Their fans is overreacting here.</br>  <br>Nana is fine, its her fans that only go apeshit. And they don't seem that cancerous anyway, notice that they just faded in the middle of the thread, unlike some Aoifags that push Aoi even though there's nothing to discuss about her than "Aoi is my goddess" or some shit like that.</br>  <br>Nice taste. She's 11th in my seiyuu ranking.</br>  <br>I don't even particularly like any of those seiyuus, people can talk/shit about them all they want, it's still seiyuu related</br>  <br>At least Nanafags start discussion, unlike Asanee fags who only talk about how much they want to fuck Asakawa.</br>  I've started to really appreciate her lately, and I'm not even a big boobs guy.   mfw I've disliked(not hate) Amamiya Sora from day one <br> mfw the current state of people realizing how overrated she is pleases me </br>  <br> big boobs <br>I can't see it from that image. Please post a more conclusive image as proof.</br></br>  <br>It really angers me when shitty seiyuus that always get typecasted gets more roles instead of actual seiyuus that have more than one vocal range.</br>  <br><br>Not like it matter.<br>All the shows that she is in sucks.<br>Punchline is the only show that I actually watch till the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're wrong.

I realized how much I like her singing voice after the first line of that symphogear beef stroganoff song</br></br>  <br>her croisée songs are a bit cutesy but nice.</br>  <br>Her singing voice sure is good but there's no good solo song from her.</br>  <br>how would you rate the three against each other? <br><br>I think everyone can agree Hayamin would be top, so would that put Naobou over Tanechan?</br></br></br>  <br>okay after skimming them briefly, i have to retract my statement. they're not cutesy at all, they're legit good. the whole soundtrack is beautiful, anyone should get it.</br>  <br>Nope. I rate them all at about the same level.With Naobu's at the bottom if I really have to choose.</br>  <br>Seems like Taneda and Touyama get casted together a lot.</br>  <br>I fucking love this slut</br>  <br>Okamoto Nobuhiko, it's on the site</br>    <br>I can only think of Kiniro and Kancolle<br><br>and kancolle has fucking everyone</br></br></br>  Join the army they said.<br>It'll be fun they said.</br>  Shooting cosplayers and fucking goth lolis sounds pretty fun to me.  <br>But the paperwork though.</br>  So when do the Americans join?  The army sucks dick, seriously, it's even worse without gothlolis and elves.

You are coming across as really uneducated.</br></br></br>  <br>The dragon wasn't supposed to show up for another 50 years, they were caught by surprise.</br>  <br>I was pretty disappointed at how they made him look like a whiny bitch instead of showing Pina threatening to burn his kingdom to the ground if he didn't give her info on the JSDF.</br>  Remember that in this, Japan:<br><br> offered a full cessation of hostilities and a return of valuable PoWs without the usual slave taking and crap, making the Empire think they will be merciful <br> in their very next sentence demanded reparations worth more than all the gold in the Empire, a sum that the Empire could never possibly pay back. <br><br> demanded and gained access to tracts of land that are rich in diamonds, signing an agreement to share the diamonds with the locals, as well as gold and silver. <br> didn't tell the local government about all the other valuable minerals that they could find there besides gold and silver, which could be worth billions back on Earth, so they could scam then out of it all without paying the locals a penny <br><br> after the negotiations and official cessation of hostilities, stumbled on some captured Japanese citizens in captivity, who they somehow they didn't already know were still unaccounted for and they never bothered to ask the Empire before then. <br> responded by bombing the Imperial Senate with JASDF fighters as a show of force with no warning, rather than going through diplomatic channels <br><br> violated Article 9 of their constitution by using JSDF to kill fire dragon and interfere with coup d'etat in foreign gateworld countries using an unconstitutional amendment to JSDF law of the kind that IRL a majority of the public is opposed to <br><br> decides that a policy of isolationism and alienating half the world is acceptable because they have a whole new world that they can rape for resources to become self sufficient </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Extreme situations can do this to people in real life.</br>  <br> anime trope that extreme terror turns your hair white. <br>Yeah, like that guy on "Ito" From Stephenu Kingu.</br></br>  Remember Kurokawa has sex with whores and she pay them in condoms and check ups   we haven't seen the real mastermind behind everything yet   <br>None of those actions are unreasonable.</br>  <br> slubunny <br> a mastermind <br>Anon pls stop trolling.</br></br></br>  <br>Or uncommon.</br>  <br>I thought they made it pretty clear that the only thing they and their allies wanted from the gateworld were natural resources, so I fail to see how this is a bad move on their part.</br>  <br>Of course it'll be fun anon their own recruitment propagan- I mean Patriotic Service Announcements say so. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mBi<wbr>cFXijh9s</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.youtube.co/watch?v=3V42<wbr>SyYYcvI<br>https://www.youtube.co/watch?v=U5nB<wbr>4PIl2cE<br><br>Also  it is your patriotic duty to protect Nippon from Chinese influence, the Special Region ain't gonna colonize itself! </br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welp, I never expected fantasy harem power wank story to display such realism as far as diplomacy is concerned.</br>  I want to fuck her, hard, and lovingly.  <br> fantasy harem power wank story <br><br>I have no idea what gave you that impression. Because there are female characters around the MC?</br></br></br>  <br>It's more of a modern weaponry wanking than harem wanking really.</br>    <br> Common anime trope that extreme terror turns your hair white. <br> Common anime trope <br>I see muricans do this to.</br></br></br>  <br> I am a serious soldier  <br> Just check out my bikini armor  <br> Please take me seriously </br></br></br>  <br>If you are hit by a torpedo while on a ship, and you are close enough to the source of the explosion, but survive it, then the shock will be powerful enough to actually make your hair go white.<br><br>It's a fact.</br></br></br>    <br>She actually is a decent soldier it's just that the anime makes her out to be a nice and innocent girl when she is actually pretty ruthless.</br>  <br>It has more to do with her being a lot more mellow in the anime compared to manga.</br>  <br> MC is otaku who happens to be special forces member and he gets covered in bitches  <br>I wonder. <br>It might not be the focus but you can't deny the overabundance of female creatures clinging to Itami.</br></br></br>  <br> It might not be the focus <br>Good point. So it's about something else then?</br></br>  <br>None of those girls is actually into him though, they just said that because they wanted to avoid any backlash from Bozes torturing Itami.</br>  <br>And then she hits him.<br><br>Pina simply has bad luck with this.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok. so let's fix that.<br> Welp, I never expected fantasy power wank story with harem elements that aren't the focus to display such realism as far as diplomacy is concerned. <br>Good enough or would you like me to use some other wording?</br></br></br>  Moe  <br>Over the course of several stressful years sure. Overnight, not really</br>  <br>I can imagine what is going on in her mind.</br>  <br>You might want to point out that it's written by a right wing nationalist.</br>  <br>Depends on the length, really.</br>  <br><br>Yea she should've known that Bozes had a short temper.<br>Though honestly Pina is also at fault since she decided to whore Bozes out just because she didn't wanna lower her head and apologize, ultimately they both suffer from being way too prideful just like all nobles do.</br></br></br>  <br>It can. I've read about one guy's biography who was a ship captain during WWII and had his ship hit by a torpedo.<br><br>His black hair turned white in an instant due to sheer shock caused by the experience.<br><br><br>On the other hand Itami himself is plagued by bad luck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I joined the army, but there were no qt girls, no gates, no goth lolis or elves or whatever the fuck lusting after my dick  <br>Why was she wearing that anyway?</br>  <br>Pride is one of the fatal flaws. Sometimes you have to swallow it and get your shit together.</br>  <br> His black hair turned white in an instant due to sheer shock <br>These records are all very old.<br><br>In reality it takes weeks at least.<br>The only way for hair to turn gray/white overnight is if you have mixed hair (main color plus gray/white) and then you lose your healthy hair.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might want to read the rest of the comment you sperged about and notice the half assed series description wasn't the point.</br>  <br>Sucks to be you. I was doing cute chairforce things with my chairforce buddies while the grunts get smoked by their chief group.</br>  <br>Post more of the girl on the right</br>  <br>You are confusing Anonymous with Anonymous.<br>It's an easy mistake to make. We share the same non-name.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Look fags, it happens in anime, it's an anime trope. Happening in other mediums doesn't negate that. It's not an anime specific trope but it's an anime trope none the less.</br></br></br>  Do they rebuild that old man as Robocop?  <br>So who gave her that CBRN suit and why was she wearing that? Did someone tell her to do that?</br>  <br>All the rotting warriors on the former battle field spread hazardous gasses, bacteria and insects.</br>  <br>maybe she just wanted to have fun</br>  <br>And having noses is a Japanese trait.<br>It may be technically correct, but you are still coming across very uneducated.</br></br>  <br>/k/ get out</br>  Leilei is cute. CUTE!  <br>Tell that to all the nobles in the Empire, cause they all suffer from this shit.<br>Pina and Bozes only get over it after their trip to Japan.</br></br>    <br>In real life too people hair turn white during extreme stress, so if we follow your logic people dying is also an anime trope.</br>  <br>Yo, this is a huge change, how is it allowed?</br>  <br><br><br>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. anime whet</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, would stalker be the same with lolis?</br>  <br>Well, nothing is perfect.<br><br><br>I want it, but we need to be realistic here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If I recall, this isn't quite the case. Apparently, what really happens is that your hair falls out, and the only hair left afterwards is white hair.</br>  <br>While he may be special forces, he still performed the worst. He's also 33 years old, he never wants to work much and everything that has happened to him has been simply luck.<br><br>Also he only has two girls actually wanting his dick. Not a harem at all.</br></br></br>  <br>What a cop out, other anonymous. I was hoping to sling some insults in the general direction of that different anonymous but now you took all the joy from it.</br>  <br>I feel like her actually walking around a hazardous area could have been shown, the mask used as a running gag after all.</br>  <br>She understands the suit can protect her from danger, so obviously someone gave it to her, briefly explained its purpose and showed her how to put it on. But why? And why did she think it might be dangerous?</br>  <br>Because they wanna give her an innocent and kawaii image for people to fawn over, instead of representing the ruthless and perverted person that she really is.</br>  <br> wearing nbc stuff <br> having fun <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone has noses. Not every story telling medium uses hair instantly turning white to demonstrate extreme terror as commonly as anime does.</br>  <br>because adaptations are bound to be shit/mediocre</br>  <br><br> Cheeki breeki <br><br>Nigger cheeki breekies only wear shit like trenchcoats and leather jackets. That's Stalker, or at most Monolith attire she has there.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Remember Yanagida is smoking almost all the time? I don't think I've seen him smoke in the anime.</br></br>  <br>Won't use 'harem' anymore because it gets anonymouses triggered. <br>I hope 'male wish fulfillment fantasy including many female creatures' won't bother no one.</br></br>  <br><br>Like that anon said she was scavenging on dead rotting corpses so one of the soldiers probably saw her and told her to wear the suit to avoid getting sick.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about nbc suits but I wore a hazmat once and had fun.</br>  <br><br>Stop trying to deny it jesus christ.</br></br>  <br> wish fulfillment fantasy <br>Hardly.</br></br>  <br> Everyone has noses. <br>But different sizes.<br>If you are going to argue degree of use, then surely noses are a NON-Japanese trait.</br></br></br>  <br> lolis playing in the abandoned amusement park in Pripyat <br> they want to go to the ferris wheel but it's defunct </br></br>  <br>I don't get it. Are you saying those maids are into the MC?</br>  <br>What else are they going to sanitize and simplify for the audience?<br><br>Replaced more world building infodumps with an anime-original bathing scene in the recent episode.<br><br>Notably, mentioning the fact that the dragons they were harvesting scales and claws off of were just "target practice" for the JSDF, or that the reason they wanted to harvest them in the first place was because it was a viable and major source of income. Which segued directly into Itami's sudden mission to Itasca being due to being given orders to assist in helping the refugees establish a currency (the last bit not being really mentioned at the end of the episode).<br><br>So really, among other things, I expect Tyuule's hard sex scene to be replaced with whipping and beating, and if they get far enough, her intended gang-rape scene changed to her going S&amp;M on the would-be torturers, and at the end, get injured but live and get a Furuta happy end.<br><br>Noriko will also have been whipped and tortured rather than a rape victim.<br><br>Kuri's beating up of Zorzal's guards and Zorzal himself will be entirely off-screen with full sound effects while the camera pans to all the horrified expressions of the Imperials present, only showing her gun firing the short time she uses it.<br><br>The hot springs episode will cut out most of the early CIA vs JSDF bits in favor of more panning of the girls while they're bathing or half-drunk, as well as focusing more on Rory while the fight is going on in the 3-way melee.<br><br>About the only scenes I expect them to keep is Delilah's backstory (censored and implied since it's just short flashbacks) as well as the prostitute bit (their sheer clothes censored to full opaque).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea I expected them doing shit like that, just like how they've toned down on the violence and how they'll probably cut the rape as well, but honestly I find them butchering Pina's personality pretty disgusting.</br>  <br>It's not even that common in anime. Go on, name all the shows that has at least one such character. Don't you dare mix in video games or other non real anime as example too.</br>  <br>Also this</br>  Fucking best girl<br><br>Prove me wrong<br><br> pro tip: you fucking can't </br></br></br></br>  <br> lolis accidentally step into a whirligig </br>  <br> Kuri's beating up of Zorzal's guards <br>It will be cut.</br></br>  Striking a superior officer?  <br>As will her beating him up, she'll probably just glare at him and he'll cower.</br>  <br>Too bad I like fully developed women.<br><br> Everything else about her is fucking perfect, though. </br></br></br>  <br>i wonder if the author gives a shit or hes just enjoying swimming in money right now</br>  <br> best girl onee-san shooting bandits miles away <br> 「チーキブリーキ」 </br></br>  <br>Swimming in money, I know I would.</br>  <br><br> I like this design more than the one in the manga. </br></br>  <br>Deep down you knew the answer even before pushing the 'Post' button.</br>  <br>He's so forgiving</br>  <br>Indeed, this watered down, censored butchering, is why the anime industry sucks so bad now days.<br><br>I can deal with 95% of the new anime every season consisting of moe/ecci/shounen/mild shounen-ai pandering for female otakus, usually devoid of any depth whatsoever. That is, if they didn't fucking tone down and censor the rest of the 5% that actually has some sort of interesting premise. Hell, why not turn the MC and his soldiers into fucking high-schoolers while you're at it... If you moeify, censor and remove any adult &amp; mature themes, you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots. There are thousands of those out there, go make anime out of those instead of showing us this butchered crap.<br><br>Remove the gore, violence any sort, nudity or any sort of mature themes, and the series suddenly looses any appeal it had from the start. What's Berserk, Gungrave or say Black Lagoon without it's graphic violence and devoid of any mature and explicit content whatsoever? Fucking boring and pointless! Might as well watch swordshit moe online instead, because the difference is suddenly minimal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just the fact  she indirectly made Itami immortal with her blood pact and her wanting to spend the next 40 years until she transcends to godhood with him among her other character traits just makes her fucking perfect <br><br>If Rory loses I'll be very surprised</br></br></br>  <br>She is pretty great.</br>  <br>Really great.</br>  <br>You know, the US army has a bad habit of getting into sticky situations, doesn't it?</br>  Will you give her your daikon?  <br>Simply the best.</br>  <br> draw the wheel away from the ground <br>Nice, now it's floating.<br> add a tiny tiny arrow that is barely recognizable as such <br>What's the bike standing on?</br></br></br></br>  <br> otaku, ranger, with his own hiki waifu that happens to acquire loli demigod and showers in attention of monster girls and other female beings while using genius elf mage like a pillow <br> not wish fulfillment <br>heh</br></br></br>  <br>almost anything would be wish fulfillment according to you<br><br>next!</br></br></br>  <br>The whole "losing your humanity" deal worries me. Maybe I'm thinking too much into it.</br>  <br>1. Wagner will play, but we're treated to panning stills of the ex-army-turned-bandits going boom, and panning of Pina's stunned and crying face as gunshots and more screams are heard instead of showing the JSDF razing them all down.<br><br>2. Bozes sheer nightgown will be made plain opaque toga and less revealing. Same for the prostitute attire.<br><br>3. Catgirls and bunny girls will be more kemonomini than slightly furry. Sole exception is Deer girl.<br><br>4. Emperor's spiel aimed at Imperial Japan omitted in favor of expanded anime-original content involving a longer earthquake scene (Akusho, Alnus, and Itasca). May also cut into Kuri's one-sided assault on Zorzal's guards, if not also her one-sided assault on Zorzal.<br><br>5. Cutting out other infodumps and plot build up in order to animate the 4-komas into the main story, such as catgirl Meia's hiring and working at Alnus civilian PX store, Myuute's work ethic and unexpected singing, and the usual misadventures of Rory, Leilei, Tuka, Pina, and Bozes (the former 3 over figmas and bicycle riding, the latter 2 during baseball and ping-pong).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamikoda is a glorious bastard</br>  <br>You know, you don't have to post if you don't have any counter arguments besides 'it isn't so because I said so'.</br>  <br>Basically, she won't be able to feel.<br><br>She won't be able to feel emotion anymore, be it love or lust.<br><br>She wants to become the deity of love when she transcends so maybe she'll get some sort of cop out/asspull that will allow her to retain her ability to feel emotion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only she would become tall and busty in the process.</br>  <br> Basically, she won't be able to feel. <br> She won't be able to feel emotion anymore, be it love or lust. <br>Like Itami said, then what's the fucking point<br>I feel bad for him once he's trapped with her for eternity.</br></br></br></br>  Is it just me or are the anime designs way better than the manga designs?<br><br>Pinya made my dick diamonds as soon as she appeared on screen in the anime, but her manga design is lacking.</br></br>  <br>fucking racist torpedos</br>  <br><br>I don't really think it would be an asspull seeing as Hardy, a current God, desires to make Rory her wife even though she isn't supposed to have said desires or feelings.</br></br>  <br>I disagree.</br>  <br>The point is to make the most of the time she has left where she can still feel and express those emotions.<br><br>Like I said though, I expect, or rather hope, she'll get an asspull/change of script of some sort where she retains that ability.</br></br></br>  I know that a lot of stuff in the manga can't be on tv , but I really don't understand what this director is trying to do.<br> serious political scene <br> Japanese PM getting grilled by reporters <br> several days later, in the special region, bath scene! </br></br></br>   Centurions riding on tanks while holding their banners. <br><br> Vanguard taking a page from VC2's Fencers and providing anti-arrow defense for gunners. <br><br>I didn't realize how much I want this to be animated.  Though IIRC, this doesn't happen until near the end of the novel. </br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck is this<br>superior to pic related.</br></br>  <br>Wait it actually happens, I thought it was just Diabo fantasizing.</br>  <br> coup d'etat happen and the JSDF protect the Emperor from the traitors </br>  <br>Itami would easily be into them. With his penis. Inside their vaginas. If you know what I'm saying.<br><br>I'm talking about sex.</br></br></br>  <br>blowout soon, fellor lelei le rererereireirei</br>  <br>You lost me.</br>  <br>So it seems everything turns out according to the Emperor's plans huh.</br>  So he made it out alive. How? Why wasn't he captured? For that matter why didn't the JSDF even try to capture some officers?  <br>Plot no Jutsu</br>  <br>considering his plan is to ensue the empire survival after the huge fuck up with the gate, yes everything works great for him</br>  <br>magic, mage is a cheater</br>  <br>It's mentioned that a lot of the soldiers turned tail and ran when they saw all of their friends being slaughter, it's were the bandits that attack Itallica come from. Some of Duran's soldiers were able to safely retreat one of them probably picked him up and dumped him there.</br>  <br>With all the insubordination he's getting away with, he should be.</br>  <br>I am saying that the arrow that doesn't look like an arrow makes it seem like the bike isn't hovering but standing on something.</br>  <br>It's not an actual, physical, arrow you know, just a figure meant to indicate distance.</br>  <br>it's not easy to capture someone when you are just carpet bombing<br> Anyways he become the first king signing an alliance with Japan and gives noble titles to Itami. </br></br>  <br>Water evaporated.</br>    <br>You are retarded.</br>  <br> indirectly <br>She knew exactly what she was doing when she made the pact.<br> You're not getting away from me by dying, lover. </br></br></br>  <br> his hair turned white? How? From the slaughter? <br><br>Didn't you see Ghost in the Shell S.A.C.? A girl gets kidnapped as a teenager and 16 years later she looks like an old woman due to the stress of living with a bunch of terrorists and being a sex toy.</br></br></br>  <br>And that's why wells are completely useless.</br>  <br>I said indirectly because she didn't actually make him immortal <br><br>But instead she soul bound him so that even if he takes mortal damage, he wouldn't actually die since the damage would be transferred to her and she's already immortal. negating it<br><br>Or is that directly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't need to keep on shelling.</br>  <br>The bait is strong in this one.</br>  <br>Here he tells Pina how his remaining soldiers abandoned him and went back home.</br>  <br><br>Also they captured a ton of soldiers which they use to negotiate with the Empire later on.</br></br>  <br>The mere fact after all these centuries she didn't lose her morals (mostly) is amazing. I too wish she doesn't lose her essence/personality when ascending.</br>  All the early volumes of Gate, both the novel and light novel editions, just sold out on Amazon.<br>It looks like a success already.</br>  <br>Translations never ;_;</br>  <br>So you're just shitposting overtime?</br>  <br>Those are mostly from the Ginza incident though.</br>  <br>It's just you. All we get in anime is reused SAO/Idolmaster designs. It's a wonder they didn't copypasted Kirito as MC.</br>  <br>I guess you can be a ruthless killer without being a wholly evil entity.</br>  <br><br>I'M NUUUUUUCLLEEEEEAAAAAAAR</br></br>  <br>She could be nicer.</br>  <br>Then why did they keep lamenting about not knowing anything about the power structure? They didn't interrogate the soldiers?</br>  <br>She doesn't need to be nice to anyone but Itami tbh<br><br>Itami is really the only thing she cares about and that's a very nice character trait to have</br></br></br>  <br> tbh <br>Stop that.</br></br>  I'm mad casuals are watching this. All those misconceptions and taking the /ak/ translations as gospel is killing me.<br> why is it great iron cock the translation said rod of steel <br> i heard the original work was incredibly racist and jingoistic <br> i've read the LN </br></br></br>  <br>Sorry.<br><br>Forgot where I was for a moment</br></br></br>  <br>They can't communicate because they don't know each others language, they don't really get a grasp on their language until Lelei becomes fluent in Japanese, and by that point they'd already met Pina and had diplomatic meetings with her, long before.</br>  <br>By nicer I meant less "evil".<br><br> Itami is really the only thing she cares about and that's a very nice character trait to have <br>Oh god, I'm having flashbacks to monster girl generals for some reason.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yet Itami was able to communicate with the village elder.</br>  <br>She's not evil at all, the only people she kills are bandits and people like them.</br>    <br>Seeing the world in black and white like that is kind of evil.</br>  <br>So killing people is fine if they've broken the law or intend to?</br>  <br>He could barely get some words through, didn't you notice him speaking like a retard.</br>  鉄の逸物 = The Iron Cock<br>/ak/ just went for a more generic translation than the literal one because reasons.</br>  <br>Man, am I glad you aren't in charge of laws.</br>  <br>If I remember right, he worked with prisoners and was able to get some gasp on language, thus pocketbook with some words.</br>  <br>Yes, because he obviously isn't a linguist and he didn't bother to study it very hard.

I would bet $5 that my burger brothers would do something like buy enough politicians to keep Article 9 in place so they can use it as a pretense for being the strong arm of the Japanese - thus worming their way just far enough past the gate that they can do whatever the fuck they want later on.</br></br>  <br> the moment you take an innocent soul you stop being human and is ok to kill you? <br>That is a really difficult law to uphold, which is why I am pretty sure there has never been a non-fictional world where such a rule would have been used.<br><br> they don't have the same morals as we do <br>We could judge her by their rules if we knew them.

For that reason I enjoyed it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So what i guess are 'filler' or side show episodes are fun but not the plot or character interaction?</br></br>  which shipgirls would you want to make a mothership?  <br>Not Tenryuu</br>  <br>Kaga-san</br>  <br>I did it.</br>  <br>Zuihou!</br>  I remember when Akagi was the fatty.  <br>Well I mean the curry episode just stood out above the rest since I wouldnt have needed a hang over to enjoy it. Its about the fleet holdng a contest to see who makes the best curry and Nagato is the judge. Follows Loli Division 6 as they try to be the underdogs rising to first place against the odds. <br><br>The rest of it is not anything too special, but like I said its a good show for if you just need to watch something you hold no expectations for because thinking is too much effort in your current state. Which is why its my favorite hangover anime.</br></br></br>  well someone on the anime staff clearly wants bucky.  <br>That disgusting lower abs</br>  Daijoubu  Is Re legal  <br>If Houshou-san was my mother, things would be different here.</br>  Isokaze is doing things to me again!

However, like many have said, the curry content episode was enjoyable despite being halfway through the show. The final sortie (last two episodes) is drawn out and it gets seriously dumb by the time it's finally over. <br><br>Overall, it's mediocre, I wouldn't recommend it unless you absolutely are dying for more KanColle material. Also, you'll mostly only see characters from CarDiv1, CarDiv5, DesDiv6, Kongou and Sendai class, and the main three (Fubuki, Yuudachi, Mutsuki). Most of the other girls are rarely relevant and you either see them infrequently or not at all.<br><br>I would recommend downloading the OST, however. Miiro and Fubuki are absolutely fantastic.

That was great.</br>  <br>Rap owns. Kendrick Lamar is GOAT. Post approved.</br>  <br>They didn't even bother coming up with a reason for why they had to recreate Midway. The official purpose for the operation was to learn more about the Abyssal's origins and objectives, but none of them seemed to give a shit about the first one they found that could talk. They could have skipped the entire fight if it was so dangerous. It's not like we ever saw or heard of them posing an immediate threat to anyone. The Abyssals did nothing wrong; they only ever defended themselves.</br>  <br>Well the whole shoehorning Fubuki to be Akagi's destroyer seemed to make sense, seeing how IRL Fubuki was apparently Yamato's escort. With the whole butterfly effect and all that, maybe Admiral-san is the genre-savvy god-head that tried to change things from the very beginning.<br>And yet Akagi is the one that has freaky premonitions...</br></br>  would you do a lewd army dog?  <br>Akaga a shit.<br>Dragons a shit.<br><br>Seriously, they deserved their firey death near Midway atoll.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I said shoehorning, I meant more of Taihou showing up to send out some planes and say "BTW TTK IS OK" and then do absolutely nothing else. What was the point?<br><br>Fubuki showing up to prevent Akagi from sinking was to be expected. As soon as we saw the premonition, there was no doubt some greater force would prevent it from happening. That force being Fubuki throughout the entire series.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a shame that they focused so much on the battles. All of them were boring but at least the ones in the earlier episodes didn't bothered me that much since they weren't the focus of the episode. That completely ruined the last 2 episodes.</br>  <br> Kancolle <br> small c <br><br><br><br>Absolutely not.<br><br><br> Episode 6 <br> fun <br>So are kangaroo courts I guess.<br><br><br> I wouldn't recommend it unless you absolutely are dying for more KanColle material. <br>I would not recommend it even if you are.<br><br><br><br>Fubuki did nothing wrong.<br><br><br>Shoukaku</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The Abyssals did nothing wrong. <br>What were the right thing they did?</br></br>  <br>Would rape her into oblivion</br>  <br> Fubuki did nothing wrong. <br>Fubuki a shit, she's only ok when she's on crack</br></br>  <br>Sink Kisaragi</br>  <br> inb4 but Kisaragi didn't sink </br>  <br>Becoming my cumpdumpsters.</br>  <br>The problem is that Tanaka/Diomedea was never prepared for (and could never have made) a serious plot that would compromise some of the deliberate ambiguity they've fostered for the benefit of the doujin community. They didn't try to do any worldbuilding, anything about the abyssals, or anything about the shipgirls themselves outside of vague premonitions of events that were already confirmed via shipgirl memories canonically, which means the end result was so safe it was sickening. People may not like the Shimakaze doujin, but at least it's trying something different--it shows a little of what's going on in the world immediately outside that of the immediate shipgirls. At that manga's Admiral has a face.<br><br>I really don't like the idea that they make a pure SoL or comedy, but if they want to make a serious plot they're going to have to take a risk, like the LN series and some of the Manga.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You guys are real crazy.</br></br>  They're liking chinese kancolle, heh.<br>http://may.2chan.net/b/res/34616537<wbr>3.htm</wbr></br>  <br>Does Ritou count as a loli or what?</br>  <br>Rap is a shipgirl's soul.</br>  <br>They're for passionate sex.<br><br>Kaga is the new idol of the fleet.</br></br></br>  <br> They didn't nag Shokaku or Zuikaku to hurry and get fucking ready and participate too <br>I stand corrected<br>Fuckinnn magic</br></br></br>  <br>At least for me, a loli is a girl who looks 12 or younger, Ritou looks about 14 so she's not a loli like Hoppou.

I think I only know two exceptions, once in baki and another time in Tough otherwise you just never see them.<br><br>Then you have all these 'what if' stories about going back in time/changing history/altering the course of the war that just reeks of an oudated, pathetic clinging onto of nationalistic sentiment. <br><br>You never see the Germans glorifying the nazis/hitler but that shit seems to fly just fine with the japs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate this so much.<br>In western media, works that have the mafia or criminal gangs as main characters will never portray the mafia as good things for society. They'll show that the gang members are people that care about their families and sometimes show that they had no choice but to turn to crime, but at the end of the day, all they do is hurt others and do evil things. Just watch the Godfather trilogy, Breaking Bad or the Sopranos.<br>In the west we enjoy works about criminals, but we never think of them as anything but criminals.<br>Why does a society that is so much more conformist to the rules like Japan glorify criminals that commit murder, drug dealing and human trafficking so much?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What redeeming qualities of a yandere are you talking about? There are none, 2d or 3d</br>    <br> You never see the Germans glorifying the nazis/hitler but that shit seems to fly just fine with the japs. <br>Again, it's less Japan glorifying the era and more Japan refusing to accept any responsibility for the era, never talking about it</br></br>  <br>America sees crime as a part of life. It happens all the time. When you see stuff on the news about riots and violence, you begin to recognize it. Plus, America went through a recession and has way more ethnicities, which leads to some resorting to crime in order to live.<br>Japan's cleanliness and conformity makes crime less prominent in society's view, so people glorify it more.</br></br>  <br>It also helps that the Yakuza still hold a lot of sway in Japan's entertainment industry and other sectors.<br>American gangsters are nowhere near as influential, Big Business is in charge and doesn't need gunmen to get what it wants</br></br>  <br>Plus, in order to be part of the mafia, you need to be part Italian, which isn't as prominent after multiple generations. Yakuza members want Japanese people, which there are a pretty large supply of in Japan.</br>  <br><br>This is why I hate Nisekoi. They treat the criminal gangs as goofy lovable characters instead of the corrupt evil criminals they truly are, and Raku feels no guilt about profiting from other people's misery whatsoever yet is a "nice guy"</br></br>  <br>You mean that I could be petting them and then they suddenly fucking bite me for no reason and run off?</br>  Peeping on girls, stealing their underwear and groping them is acceptable "boys will be boys" behaviour and women who get angry about it and yell BAKA HENTAI are just overreacting  <br>I'm sure it has been okay to assault perverts in anime since the early 80s.</br>  <br>But the perverts are portrayed as just being boys doing boy things because they're in their springtime of youth or whatever. It's portrayed as just being a harmlessdumb thing like drinking alcohol or something, not like a crime</br>  <br> Again, it's less Japan glorifying the era and more Japan refusing to accept any responsibility for the era, never talking about it <br>They can't glorify it openly for obvious reasons, but they do in a subtle way, that's not actually so subtle. But I do agree that they refuse responsibility for their actions during and prior to WW2.</br></br>  <br>Considering that those types of characters are usually met with some kind of comeuppance and their male peers rarely ever act the same way, I never got the impression that it was perfectly normal.</br>    <br>But that's not a lie. You really can buy a lot of porn on DVD.</br>  <br> i dont think we would ever see master roshi again if he found the internet </br>  <br>Honestly, I doubt he could get a connection on his island.</br>  <br> They can't glorify it openly for obvious reasons, but they do in a subtle way, that's not actually so subtle <br>Such as?</br></br>  <br> Such as? <br>Literally almost any /a/ related media that focuses around that particular era (early-mid 20th century), especially if the military is involved.</br></br>  <br>Even Miyazaki. He made a movie set in WWII that glossed over all that horrible stuff to focus on airplane engineer</br>  <br> He made a movie set in WWII that glossed over all that horrible stuff to focus on airplane engineer <br>Well, in the air rises he actually does point out MC being 'critical' of the war - but that's usually as far as the 'criticism' will go. <br><br>Usually if it's not just full out nationalistic, we're better than everyone else, nippon 2 stronk, then it usually involves a gary stu-ish character making japan look good while they complain about the war, but do nothing to actively resist it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. If they can compress matter into capsules, the moon turns saiyans into giant apes, and they can change their hair color from black to spiked blonde at will, then I wouldn't be surprised if they found a way to get him a connection.</br>  <br><br>In other words yeah they oversimplify a lot of the horrors that occurred during that period while making themselves look as good as possible, while trying to save some moral face by having the awesome MC state how he's against the war (yet does nothing productive to detract from it).<br><br>It really makes me wonder if they even bother to teach the Japanese youth about what really happened during those times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember this one movie a gary-stuish MC who had a Girlfriend who played some instrument before he left that became a Kamikaze pilot using a plane called the Rose or something that was portrayed as heroic and decisive in the war against the americans. The MC was the only handsome one, all the other Japanese soldiers wer goofy looking but portrayed symapthetically.<br>God I hated it, but I can't remember what it was called</br></br>   You will never have a tsundere QT who can stretch her neck <br>What's your excuse for still being alive, /a/?</br>  Well there's some anime I want to watch this season.  <br>But can I have a qt who's got 6 meters of snake tail?</br>  <br>I have a qt that gives me pussy</br>  Volume 16 got translated.<br><br> It was aliens all along! </br></br>  <br>this is getting more weird every chapter</br>    <br> ALIENS!? </br>  god I love this manga  Absolutely spooky.  <br>All fuckin right, now that was good.</br>  fuck aliens  <br>I call bait on that spoiler</br>  Hideooooooo! Useless piece of shit.  <br>Not much he could have done.</br>  The last few chapters of this volume is just wow.  <br>Dat Italian clock tower twist, I was euphoric.</br>  I just hope we don't have to wait so long for the next volume  Reminder there are zombies in this thread RIGHT NOW  I wish I was brave enough to read this didn't get past the 1st few chapters when the girl got zombied  <br>You must persevere. It's so rich and fulfilling.</br>  <br>Zombies in this thread? are you high?<br><br>That's just impossible.<br><br>Besides, it's not time to eat yet.</br></br></br></br></br>   Oda-sans last words were "YOUR COCK IS SO GOOD" <br><br>This fucking manga I swear.</br></br>  I don't know what the hell is going on anymore.<br><br>It reminds me of Gantz when it went to massive shit.</br></br>  Where can i read it???  <br>Batoto.</br>  Thanks for reminding me, OP.<br>Next volume never.</br>  WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING ANYMORE  <br>awww shit, it's finally happening, best birthday ever</br>  <br>we bokurano now</br>  <br>I thought the same thing. It's not</br>  <br>is this guy a kurusu too? <br>when will there be a female one?</br></br>  <br>We don't know that. It is very likely, but that information came from a hallucinating zombie.<br>So yeah.</br></br>  <br> It was aliens all along! <br>That's not true tho.</br></br>  <br> reading manga online <br><br> helping someone read manga online <br>You both should know better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Conchita Wurst saves the day once again!</br>  <br>This manga desperately needs someone who played Cataclysm.</br>  <br>The fact that it got as much time as it did at the end of the volume I think lend it credibility. Surely you don't waste that much time if it isn't true.</br>  <br>Yeah, If they were in a hivemind then why were the other zombies confused as to what he was talking about if it wasn't just the usual delusions they spew out?</br>  <br> new release <br> not reading it online <br><br>Unless you go to shit sites the quality is exactly the same and unless you have shit internet, it loads instantly.<br><br>I only download series if I'm binging them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it reminded me of gantz the way they're in Italy.. although I can't see this turning to shit like gantz did</br>  <br>Yeah he was blonde with short hair before. The main girl is a kurusu.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for the reveal that the USA is responsible for everything</br>  <br> Yeah he was blonde with short hair before.  <br>Wait, am i missing something?</br></br>  <br>He explained it, they were chosen as the caretakers. Somewhat disconnected from the hivemind.</br>  <br>Much earlier chapter. We see him walking around Italy with fuzzy memory. You'll have to go through I can't remember which.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128527222 <br>Says you. Aliens in only a theory but regardless, it's all done extremely well. This manga just has masterful pacing.</br>  I still find it hilarious that there were a bunch of zombies having a conversation up there.  <br> We see him walking around Italy with fuzzy memory. You'll have to go through I can't remember which. <br>I'm pretty sure that blonde guy was walking around paris, then that zombie centipede thing crushed the church he was in.</br></br>  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCCCCKKK WHHYYYYYY<br>;____;</br>  <br> not binging IAAH from the start every new release </br>  <br> that spoiler  <br><br>No one uses spoilers correctly anymore, I hope you are one of those people.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll guess with confidence this is the same guy.</br>  we need ultraman  <br> I still find it hilarious that there were a bunch of zombies having a conversation up there. <br>the next volume is even more hilarious with some NEET black ops™ having a full-on UFC brawl with a single zombie</br></br>  <br> you'll never become a symbiotic flesh structure with your fellow countrymen </br>  <br> mangafox </br>  aww she saved the little girl  I thought it was girl the entire time he was sitting down  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>Did they even know he was there? They didn't acknowledge him or his want for paninis at all.</br>  <br>Beat me to it.</br>   so jason gordon levitt is a zombie made by aliens, who kidnaps little girls so that his alien masters can fill her up with babies? <br> just like real life </br>  <br>why do all the attractive people turn into such well-spoken, knowledgable zombies?</br>  <br> At first I though he was a pedophile. </br>  <br><br>He reminded of the somewhat reasonable guy from when they were at that mall who turned into a zombie and jerked his dick off.</br></br>  <br>I forgot about that. Holy fuck that guy was amazing.</br>  God damn, I cannot handle how spooky this manga is at every turn.  <br> mangafox </br>  <br>I'm actually rereading the chapter he was in and a lot of stuff this italian guy connects to what he was saying.</br>  Is Hiromi a Kurusu?  <br>Yes. She turned and came back from it.</br>  <br>Read it, anon. The first few chapters are boring as fuck but it gets better.</br>  <br><br>Whelp I guessed wrong. That guy I was thinking of was in Belgium. He looked very similar in facial design. The Belgium guy was also implied to be a kurusu so I immediately jumped to conclusion.</br></br>  <br>Hiromi a bitch<br><br>R.I.P. best girl</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't the aliens just release a virus that kills with 100% certainity and spreads very fast?</br>  <br>who here things ayy lmaos really did it?<br><br><br>probably because of the hivemind birthing alien hybrids bullshit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aliens could work. They can't be beep boop type aliens though. Have to be something more like the gauna from Sidonia.</br>  <br>becoming part of this freaks me out less than becoming a zombie<br>like being torn to pieces and having my flesh eaten is more scary than being absorbed</br></br>  I was hoping the story would keep jumping to a different place after Itality, and we've already seen Belgium a tiny bit and also China but everything else has been Japan and it seems Vol.17 is gonna go with a new group in Japan. Would be cool to get other place and a little longer, but I seem to be the only one that doesn't care for Hideo and the main girl all that much.   volume starts <br> Oda gets bitten right away <br> not even on a cliffhanger of the last volume or this volume <br> they throw her in the trash compacter and leave her there <br>I'm sorry but what? I can't even feel anything from this</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know my friend, i felt that pain too. I fucking hate when they cut their hair.</br>  I swear this fucking manga man  <br>I actually really like Hideo because he's just an average joe that got fucking lucky because he owns a rifle. If he gets some sort of super power I'll be fucking pissed. Hiromi is whatever, don't care about her, Oda was a better character.<br><br>But it would still be nice if we got some other locations and sub plots in their, that tie into the main story. <br>The whole 2chan thing was pretty great.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he's your average joe tho, more like your average 2chan user or something, he's really weird and annoying at times imo.</br>  What the fuck is even going on in this manga anymore?<br>Does at least the mangaka know where this is headed? <br>Why not just roll over and die, it's not like humanity can reasonably survive any of this, let alone defeat it.<br>Things will only get stranger moving forward</br></br></br>  <br>It's headed toward romcom</br>  At this point the manga has become better than Gantz with it's alien gimmick  <br>At first I thought those things would start fighting to the death</br>   post yfw they were infected all along   <br>They were not infected all along, I think the only got infected when the gigantic thing got to them in the tower, thats why they weren't able to understand each other up to that point.</br>  <br>It's had plenty of these cutesy moments already. Nothing new.</br>  <br>This. Why else would the girl have gone in their if she was so freaked out by them all of a sudden</br>  <br>8 chapters of them mentally preparing themselves for sex is not a 'moment'</br>  <br>Try a little harder to get that feel. It's more impacting because of how abrupt it was. When Hiromi beckons that Oda could wind up as a kurusu like her was a heartbreaker. It was such a desperate attempt and for oda to just keep on changing into one right after this shred of hope was dangled in front of us. Oh yeah, it's got feels.</br>  <br> 8 chapters <br><br>This is normal pacing.</br></br></br>  <br>I am with you anon. I will miss Oda-san.</br>    <br><br><br>UNINSTALL</br></br></br>  Can some kind anon post magent link please, my isp block all usual places, and i don't have animebytes account  <br> entire page for taking somethin off a shelf <br>Looks about right. Have you not read this whole mango? It's got this pacing all over the place.</br></br>    <br>dude one of them didn't have flesh on their leg, they were infected for a long long time, they just never realized</br>  <br>yes, the giant tree thing probably just made them aware of themselves</br>    <br><br>What you're saying makes sense but if that's the case, why them? Why did they have to bring to the tower in the first place? Couldn't the alie just pick some other random zombie in the street to take care of her? Because so coincidentally the alien hive would bring the girl to the tower where there is a mutant, which is theorized by the italian guy that mutants are also created by the alien hive, if thats true then they weren't the real care takers and he just made the wrong assumption, and the mutant is the actual care taker? Yeah this makes sense, damn so many questions.</br></br>  How did the girl know to raise her hand? Can the "handler" zombies talk?<br><br>So many questions.</br></br>   lolicon tentacles eggs impregnation aliens rape   <br>god damnit<br><br>i knew i should've been worried when i started to read vol 13 and this shows up</br></br></br>  <br> Oda dies and then she cuts her hair into an imitation of Oda's <br><br>Not sure how I should feel about this.</br></br></br>  <br>can't some of the zombies talk? <br>Or at least form some sentences, how ever Hiromi can understand them, so maybe the girl just has the same ability, there has to be something special about her since none of the zombies in the street attacked her in the first place</br></br>  <br>I want to know what the fuck that thing the loli was holding is. Is it really just a stuffed animal? What if it's actually a legit alien, like the asshole zombie guy jokingly said?</br>  <br>They can all talk, these were still in control without realizing they were zombies. They saw everyone else infected but themeselves and the girl.</br>  THERE'S A HUGE CHUNK MISSING ON BATOTO AND I WANNA CATCH UP NOW WHERE DO I FIND IT  <br>Only those that were given some humanity a top the tower, possibly to lure the girl uo there, most can't. They can form some weird sentences but that's just random babbling. The little girl is not the same as the Kurusus or whatever with long black hair and always in semi naked.</br>  <br>google</br>  Volume 17 and 18 when?<br>please tell me they at least work on the translations and don't wait another 6 months</br>  <br>Isn't the highschooler who likes the MC a mutant?</br>  <br> Why else would the girl have gone in their if she was so freaked out by them all of a sudden <br>Because all of them are like that, but these guys could actually talk and is offering to help</br></br>  HAPPENING  WHEN WILL THEY FINISH TRANSLATING BOYS ON THE RUN. <br><br>I'm suffering.</br></br>  <br>Presumably, yeah. She hasn't started walking around in her underwear, though.<br><br>She might be special, though, seeing as how she was able to communicate with zombies even before infection. Maybe she was supposed to be a queen like the little girl, but got infected by accident (The hivemind might not be able to control baby zombies all that well? Or it could be because the hivemind wasn't established strongly enough yet).</br></br></br>  <br>That's a decent theory, I just hope she doesn't get pregnant and somehow the baby being part Hideo or some shit would make him different from the other alien babies and become a the key to save the earth or whatever nonsense. Hope I'm wrong.</br>  <br>The point of the Queen zombie is to make a hybrid, it's easier to make a hybrid if Hiromi is already infected and gets preggo from Hideo.</br>  <br>A hybrid with the aliens, anon. A human-alien hybrid. I'm assuming the hive and the zombie guardians are supposed to keep the Queen safe after she's been impregnated by the aliens.</br>  <br>Yes but we're talking about the possibility of Hiromi being a hybrid and in that case she'd be infect already so what  says its true. But still I just hope she doesn't get pregant and that entire plot point is never explored.</br>  <br>That's assuming that the zombies are the aliens and not just a biological tool the aliens invented to make whatever race that's infected subservient towards them.</br>  i was so angry at this part  <br> Hideo stop trying to cope with Odas death, it's creeping me out, I'm a gril so it's okay for me to act like a demanding bitch. <br> man up, don't be a pussy just because your waifu died <br><br>I liked her before, but that one single scene made me hate her so fucking much, seriously fuck Hiromi</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can understand her. She doesn't want to see him breaking down in front of her when he should be more reliable "as an adult".</br>  Question, anyone know where to download I Am A Hero on Illumanati's site? Or are they the kind of group that doesn't bother with DL links and just uploads them directly to a manga reading site of their choice?  <br>Never mind, I found it. Although the DL link for vol. 16 doesn't seem to be working properly.</br>  Less NTR, more zombie killing please.  So, how high are the chances of this every getting an anime? (It's better than 99% of the shit that gets an anime adaption)<br><br>Also, I heard they are working on a live action movie of I am a hero, can anyone confirm this?</br></br>  <br>With the detail in environments, characters, and pacing, I highly doubt it. I agree with you though, this is 99% better than all the moeshit out there.</br>  <br>Man, you're not even gonna cut her some slack after she just had to crush the closest thing she had to a female friend in a literal trash compactor?</br>  <br> less NTR <br><br>Not with this mangaka. He's good but still relies a bit too much on contrived NTR/despair bullshit. It's not as bad in I Am A Hero though, definitely feels relevant and not just there for "wow look at the way I kick this character while he's down aren't you sad aren't I such a good writer".</br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you're responding to, but that scene in v15 where she points the shotty at Oda really made Hiromi's stock drop for me.</br>  <br> Probably the same amount of chances 7seeds has.<br> none ;_' </br></br>  I was laughing the entire time. They just killed her so quickly.  <br>Fags who can't into IRC. I love Illuminati releases.</br>  <br><br>oh shit <br><br>she was really gonna kill her</br></br></br></br>  why can't we go back to vol 1-2 feels?  <br>We do though</br>    i really liked this part for some reason  <br> feels <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>    Would you Hiromi?  So the zombie that "ate" MC was a combination of the naked emperor, the mask kid, and knife? Why did they save MC?  <br>They didn't save MC, MC saved himself as far as I could tell.</br>  <br>When did this happen? RAWs?</br>  <br><br>WHAT?<br><br> do they do it for real or is it a dream/hallucination? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you a guy from Illuminati?</br>  <br>Why they swallowed him then?</br>  <br><br><br>Man you guys are slowpokes. People were spoiling a little while back.</br></br></br>  <br>It's from the chink scans.</br>  <br><br>Not all of us browse 24/7 <br><br>if you can just like us to the archive</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anybody want that?</br>  <br><br>Nevermind found it</br></br>  <br>seems more like otakubait</br>  <br>They were eating him and then, maybe, Hideo somehow connected with their hivemind? Then mask kid helped Hideo take control of the body?</br>  <br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/126795<wbr>484/#126795765<br><br>if anyone is interested</br></br></wbr></br></br>  Do you approve of aliens?  <br>I don't approve of anything post vol 13</br>  <br>I really do, shit got really interesting, a zombie story that I can actually enjoy, and it's from Japan.<br><br>I was really surprised with the events on volume 13 and 14, but now I'm sold.</br></br></br>  Guys, I'm scared.  What the fuck is going on? Seriously this shit is getting on my nerves. I really like dropping this manga just so i can avoid the tension  <br>As long as it stays an in-universe theory. <br><br>I don't want a final showdown with Hideo and the alien mastermind, like the ending of Spriggan.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the hell does this thing look like it should be chanting "WASSHOI"?</br></br>  <br>my fucking sides<br><br><br>Buckle up anon, this ride isn't getting any less rough.</br></br></br></br>  Are the people at the end of the volume new?<br><br>How many viewpoints have we seen so far?<br><br>Hideo's edito who was the zombies.<br>That French guy who was the zombies.<br>The Italians and the tourists who was the zombies. <br>The other band of survivors who went to shit with the Kurusus.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh shit, there is even a Berlusconi cameo in the part setted in Italy. Chapeau.<br><br>Also, I think the author may have watched too many cyriak videos on youtube<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WQO<wbr>-aOdJLiw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> good "different" manga. <br> getting an adaptation <br> ever <br>Actually, please no, they would fuck it up to hell and back.</br></br></br></br>  How far do you think the manga has progressed?<br><br>Past the 50% point?</br></br>  <br>Gakkou Gurashi does pretty well so far, though of course it has its huge share of moebait, otherwise there would be no adaptation ever.</br>  Jesus Christ  <br>I think so.</br>  New Vinland Saga.        <br> buzzsaws and industrial drills <br><br>Wat, are we still in 11th century Europe?</br></br></br>  TYBH    This time already. Fuck yeah Hox.  <br>posting images during a chapter dump is just rude.</br>  <br>Sure, why the fuck not.</br>  <br>Too bad.<br><br>It's only one chapter, not a volume, you raging newfaggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but they're still fucking annoying on auto-expand.</br>  <br>That's your problem.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the image limit. Who the fuck wants to see whitebeard as he's scrolling through?</br>  For people who're curious, waterpowered saws, while not too far-fetched considering their use in Roman times and in the high middle ages, they would still use a regular saw. Circular buzzsaws is something exclusive to the industrial era.  <br>Is Teedus more to your taste?</br>  <br>Between that and this page then I suppose it makes sense. Not the first time there've been technical liberties taken after all.</br>    <br>Who doesn't? Get the fuck out of here.</br>  <br>I don't really mind as long as it's just a singular genius inventing things lightyears ahead and not the society as a whole anachronistically using it.<br><br>Also, surprisingly enough, ball bearing axles were also a thing in Roman times.</br></br></br>  <br>What would've been their capacity to make something circular at all? Even if it was slightly off, the rotation would make cutting pretty fucking retarded I assume, or break other things.</br>  By the way Hox, are you sure the download link for Historie v9 is working?<br><br>I can't download it on either Firefox or Chrome.</br></br>  <br> ball bearing axles were also a thing in Roman times. <br>I had never heard that before. That's pretty neat.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I figured actual ones would be a swaying straight edge type. Making a circular saw blade that actually works requires hydraulically punching a sheet of metal, I think.</br></br>  <br>While that would've posed challenges too, I think the main problem with a circular saw in pre-modern times is that it requires an extremely fast rotation speed, as opposed to a conventional saw which can cut timber more based on the weight and power of the saw, which can easily be achieved with a large enough water wheel and pulleys.</br>  <br><br>I don't mind that as an excuse, but I really hate it when authors do this.<br><br>"It took hundreds of years of building upon existing technology to come up with this? Guess I'll just have one smart character singlehandedly 'invent' it and everything else I conveniently need for this story"</br></br></br></br>    <br> 'invent' it and everything else I conveniently need for this story" <br>I don't think that's what's going on here.

My bad.</br>  <br>And I want that guy to be my father-in-law, holy crap</br>  <br>I don't want to watch Hild's family die in front of her, which is of course going to happen in the next few pages</br>  <br>Umm, it was working before but right now it seems mega is having some troubles.

Are you a genius inventing 2300's technologies?</br>  <br>He's definitely a great guy, especially by medieval standards. She's obviously going to become their cash-cow, however, so the benefits of keeping her inventing also outweigh the benefits of most potential marriages.</br>  <br><br>You called it</br></br>    <br><br>Yeah, but it really sells short the amount of ingenuity and effort it took to make those advances in the first place.<br><br>Sure to us in the future where these things are commonplace we might take them for granted, but we have to look these technological advances from the perspective of the setting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>...aaand here it comes.</br>  <br>oh man DILF as fuck</br>  Goddamnit, these people are really cool.<br><br>Fucking Vikings.</br></br>  <br><br>FUCK</br></br>  <br> is a good guy <br> likes money <br> is a viking <br>What else could I possibly ask for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, ignoring the reference to Da vinci's flying machine concept in her room, the ball bearing axle and waterpowered saw isn't farfetched, considering their use in roman times. It's more lost technology, if anything. The circular saw is the only thing that's much harder to swallow, given the technical difficulties required to get it to work.</br>  Thorfinn will save them.      <br>Other way around.</br>  Thank you Hox.<br><br>Last chapter was still the forest fight, right?</br></br>  We finally see some vikings again and I can't even be happy about it.  <br><br>It ain't gonna happen.<br><br>I love this. The whole first half of this series is about how awesome vikings are, and so far the second half is deadset on portraying them as the biggest bastards in history.<br><br>It's such a stark contrast and I love it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, he will give them SALVATION.</br>  <br>Yup. Looks like Yukimura's taking us on a flashback to show us what Thorfinn said to Hild back then, which she's trying in the present to get him to remember again.</br>  <br> The whole first half of this series is about how awesome vikings are <br>That's not entirely true. Remember the village they slaughtered for the winter?</br></br>  I'm about 20 chapters behind and I think I'm gonna marathon it tonight. Should be good.    When are you uploading this to batoto?    Fucking vikings ruining technological advances  <br>You had one job</br>      <br>Do you even history<br>How do you think people lived in olden times<br>They weren't retards</br></br></br>      <br>I think I know what's coming, and I wish I didn't</br>  <br>niggas better be getting back in that tree soon</br>    <br>Jesus will save the day once again.</br>    <br><br>Damn, beat me to it.</br></br>  <br>That's one small face</br>  Pssh... Nothin' personal, Hrafnkell.  <br><br><br>Sadmind</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>My sides. I am such an asshole.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thorfinn got any jesus in him now? I remember the old master in his previous farm got a bible read to him, maybe Thorfinn gonna quote this during the next chapter.</br>  <br>Just me or . That's a big head.</br>  Sendspace link for this chapter: https://www.sendspace.com/file/9n1i<wbr>qx</wbr>  <br>Why you do this.</br>    <br>pfft like fucking andre from prison school</br>  I guess Hrafnkell is a Thors type character, retired viking whose past comes back to haunt him.  The wait for the next chapter is going to be hard.<br><br>Thanks as always Hox.<br><br><br><br><br>Or somebody like this sleazy bastard paid to have him offed because his workshop was competition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably, considering the hit put out for him.</br>  <br>:|</br>  <br>HILD A CUTE</br>  <br>Thanks for the chapter Hox.</br>  <br>This just shows how much better Thorfinn's character has gotten.</br>    <br>I think the relative gap we've had in panels like this makes it more shocking than it should be.</br>  For people who like Historie, I just released tankoban scanlations of volume 9. I'll probably dump it on /a/ tomorrow. You can find it on my site or the link I posted on     <br>It's interesting that with Thorfinn's character development, seeing his old self again is actually scary.</br>  For the anon that wanted to see how Kodansha did this scene back in the RAW thread.<br><br>Sorry I didn't see that before it archived.</br></br>  <br>Why's the picture so dark? Did you take it?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, just now. I nearly forgot.</br></br>    <br>That's a bit better, Latin "Britannia" adds flavor.</br>  <br>I'm shipping Thorfinn and Hild hard now, help</br>  <br>Just now? I have been shipping them since she was introduced</br>  <br>I was expecting "Forgive them Father, they know not what they do" or "Love your enemies".</br>  <br>Or turn the other cheek</br>  <br><br><br>Didn't she say "eye or an eye, tooth for a tooth" already?</br></br></br>  <br>Technically, the original Japanese didn't give an actual quote. Literally just "Forgive others and it'll save you" I changed it to an actual Jesus quote about forgiving others since I thought it'd fit better.</br>  <br>I expect Gudrid to win the other Thorfinnbowl and he and our Thorfinn fuse into one in the sagas<br><br>There must be a reason why there's two guys with the same name..</br></br></br>  <br>How is this related?<br><br>Didn't he talk about the Oedipus complex?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not smart enough to know about philosopher that talk about father complex, so sigmund will have to do.</br>  <br> philosopher <br><br>Don't you mean psychologist?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, fuck me.</br>  <br><br>Besides much needed comic relief, that's pretty much his raison d'etre.</br></br>  <br> Hrafnkell begs to let daughter escape <br> Thorfinn agrees, begins to fight Hrafnkell <br> Thorfinn recognizes father in Hrafnkell <br> doesn't kill him <br> hijinks <br> other viking kills him <br> daughter still thinks Thorfinn killed him <br>Bam. I just saved you three chapters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WHAT A TWEEST<br><br>But nah I think Thorfinn confessed to killing her father already.</br></br></br>  <br>Thorfinn probably did kill him, or he would've said something back 2 chapters ago, instead of completely admitting it.</br>  Wait, vikings had buzzsaws?  <br>No.</br>  <br><br>Wouldn't that defeat the entire point of forcing Thorfinn to come to terms with the shitty things he's done?</br></br>  Ive never read Vinland Saga before this thread.<br><br>Is this series just vikings doing viking things? I might have to read some more.</br></br>  <br>It's loosely based on the actual Vinland Saga, an account of the colonization of North America by viking sailors. Rather than focusing on that, however, the manga is more about depicting Viking life in this period at large, in warfare, trading, farming, and sailing.</br>  <br><br>Come on, it's obvious. Thorfinn feels personally responsible for the father getting killed. Maybe Thorfinn screwed up and caused his death. I could very well be completely wrong, but I'm calling this. <br><br><br>In the scenario I've described, Thorfinn would still feel like shit for his actions and have to come to terms with them while also allowing this new character to stick around or at least be usable for a later date.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, does that sound like old Thorfinn to you? Remember, old Thorfinn killed a TON of people and didn't give a damn. All he cared about was his revenge. <br><br>This isn't a shitty shounen manga situation where it seems like a hero did something bad but it turns out it was a misunderstanding. We know Thorfinn did a lot of shitty things, we've SEEN him do it. Which is why his new devotion to pacifism is a lot more powerful, because he knows the alternative is just more death .</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's obvious at all. While I can't deny the possibility of what you describe, I see no reason to have Yukimura change who really killed Thorfinn. <br><br>Just look at this page. She clearly said it was Thorfinn who slit her father's throat. This isn't a case where the daughter escaped and later assumed that her father's killer could only be Thorfinn as that was the last attacker she saw. She must've clearly seen the moment of her father's murder, if she's describing it as a slitting of the throat instead of all the other ways he could've died, like being stabbed in the back for example.</br></br></br>  <br>Was it stated whether or not she escaped after her father died or was she captured?</br>  <br>She wasn't captured, as Thorfinn remembers her as a girl who fell into a stream. Although not explicitly stated whether she escaped before or after her father's death, I'm finding it hard to believe she could've escaped before her father's death, if she's so sure that Thorfinn slit his throat. Still, it's not definite. It's possible that she could've gone back and saw her father's corpse and figured out how he died. But then there's also the possibility that Askeladd's band would've taken Hrafnkell's severed head back as proof for whoever hired them for the hit.</br>  <br>I can't believe the art used to look like this, also slave girl a cute too.</br>  <br>Very based.</br>  <br><br>Let's piece it together.<br>From her perspective, Thorfinn slit her father's throat. Thorfinn stated she fell into a river. Hild also mentioned that she at least heard his comrades interacting with Thorfinn. This all fits into my theory really neatly of Thorfinn not killing him directly, but indirectly, because of his allies and Hild misunderstanding it but Thorfinn still feeling like he killed her father anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>You haven't explained why she thinks Thorfinn slit his throat though. Why would she think he slit her father's throat, if she didn't see her father die before her eyes?</br>  <br><br><br>God damnit.</br></br></br>  <br> using the butt-end to try to stab through a linothorax <br><br>I don't think so, Tim.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Right? Yukimura should never have tried to do weekly releases.</br></br>   Peace peace peace love forgiveness happiness violence-is-bad <br><br>An engaging, exciting story this does not make.</br></br>  <br>Speak for yourself. I'm enjoying the infusion of Christian values on Norse society of this period.</br>  <br>So when will they start crusading and kill brown people?</br>  <br>It was usual for both ends of a spear to be pointed - why wouldn't the butt do?</br>  <br>The first 50 or so chapters were focused on his quest for revenge and how it fucked him over, so all this redemption seeking holds its ground.</br>  <br>You asked for it.</br>  <br>Don't worry, they will fight Native Americans once they get to Vinland. Thorfinn is probably going to be arrowed like his dad.<br><br>Also they're going to Constantinople so we might see some kind of Eastern action. I hope we get some callback to Snake through the Varangians.</br></br></br>  <br>Well is 裂かれて specifically slit anyway? Thorfinn could have simply been attacking at his neck when she last saw them or any number of similar scenarios. She could have seen it as she was falling into the stream, obscuring her view of the events.</br>  <br>First of all, the sauroter (butt-spike) was not shar enough to penetrate through armour. While a lot of historians have theorized on a possible offensive use of the sauroter in case the spear tip broke, both archaeological findings of sauroters and historical references themeselves do not support this theory, as it's mentioned that pikemen would just go on using the broken tip or switch to their swords. Secondly, think about the impracticality of turning a 4-7 meter long sarissa around in the midst of a battle. It's just pants on head retarded.</br>  <br>The themes aren't the plot, man.<br><br>And I like it - it's a perfectly fine message that I agree with.<br><br><br><br>Alright, but then why have two points?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guts gets plenty of character development though</br>  <br>No, it can just generally mean some sort of "cutting" action. I went with slit because of the association with throat. Regardless, if she's describing that her father died from an attack to his neck, I'm leaning towards the view that she did in fact see him die. But I guess we'll see who's right in future chapters.</br>  <br>I'm not advocating killing people, christ. Of course it's a great message and an even better moral for the story, it simply doesn't make an exciting one.</br>  <br>Ah, this always give me a good chuckle.</br>  <br>The sauroter was useful as a balancing counterweight, especially since the sarissa was so long.</br>  <br>I forgot this existed, and lol'd all over again.</br>  <br>You could jam it in the ground to make charges less effective.</br>  <br><br>Also so that hands can rest.<br><br><br>I love that "sauroter" literally means "lizard killer"<br><br><br>Well, so did Conan -- eventually he bears the weight of the crown like Canute</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sg5<wbr>wZavwDms</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br> I hope we get some callback to Snake through the Varangians. <br>Was Snake supposed to have been a Varangian? I don't recall that.<br><br><br>In that case, why bother shaping it like the acting point, instead of just sticking a cylinder of iron on the end?<br><br><br>Would cavalry EVER charge into a pikewall?<br><br><br>What are exciting themes?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I also believe the buttspike was only really used for bracing the pike into the ground and as a general counterweight, I disagree that it couldn't be used as a weapon. While it cannot piece, it could be used as a bludgeoning weapon utilizing downward swings. For the logistics of turning over such a long pike in combat, it's actually fairly simple. To do so, you simply pull the pike in at a slight downward angle as the the back end does the opposite - rising at a slight angle while being pushed out - allowing you to quickly vertically flip the pike.</br>  <br>Art looked better back then. The manga was better back then, too.</br>  <br>Cavalry aren't the only troops that can charge</br>  <br> What are exciting themes? <br><br>Action.</br></br></br>  <br> While it cannot piece <br>Meant pierce, don't flame me</br></br>  <br>Think it was hinted visually. He had a sabre, lamellar armor and a Greek Bible if I recall correctly.</br>  <br>I agree that it "can" be used as a weapon in the sense that almost anything heavy or hard can be used as a weapon. But was it expected to be used as a secondary weapon? I don't think so.<br><br>I'm heavily quoting from Christopher Matthew's Storm of Spears, as I think it's hands down the best book on hoplite combat, but here are some historical references he uses to support his view:<br><br>There is, in fact, no evidence at all to support the use of the sauroter as an ancillary weapon. Diodorus states that once the hoplite had broken his spear, he continued to fight using his sword, not the sauroter attached to the remaining section of the shaft. Herodotus states that the Spartans on the third day of the battle of Thermopylae resorted to using their teeth and hands only when both their spears and swords had been broken in the fighting.7 The Spartans must have drawn their swords as secondary weapons when their spears had become unserviceable and the broken shaft and sauroter were most likely discarded on the field as there is no reference to the use of the sauroter as a weapon. Xenophon's account of the aftermath of Coronea also details the use of the sword as a secondary weapon as some are still held in the hands of the dead. Broken spears are merely listed amongst the carnage, not cited as weapons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you actually think the crusades were racist?<br><br><br>I feel like planting the pike in the ground to brace for infantry, which are lot smaller and more agile, is a bad idea, because then the pike can't be adjusted.<br><br><br>Which page? That's extremely interesting and I wish I'd noticed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some theories that offer literary references as support to their conclusions for the use of the sauroter as a secondary weapon, cite either a passage of Xenophon (Hellenica 6.2.19) and/or a passage of Polybius (6.25.9) as proof of the use of the sauroter in this manner. However, neither passage outlines the use of the sauroter in a secondary offensive capacity by a hoplite in combat. Xenophon details the use of the sauroter by a hoplite commander to administer an admonishing blow to an insubordinate officer.9 Striking with the sauroter is likely to be the result of an intention to punish the offending individual with a blow from the heavy end of the weapon rather than actually injuring him with a blow using the spearhead. Polybius states that the problem with the Roman cavalry lance is that it does not possess a spike on the end of the shaft and that, if the head breaks, the weapon becomes useless. Hanson interprets this passage as referring to all Roman spears in general; not just the lance of the cavalry. From this he extrapolates that the Roman infantry spear was not as good as that of the Greek hoplite due to its lack of a sauroter. He concludes that because the rear end of the Roman infantry spear could not have been used as a secondary weapon, it must have therefore been possible to do so with the sauroter of the Greek spear. Interestingly, the lances carried by Macedonian cavalry were also equipped with a butt-spike. However,when the lances carried by Alexander's cavalry broke at the Granicus, the shattered weapons were abandoned in favour of swords or replacement lances; the butt-spike appears to not have been used as an alternative weapon.13 Diodorus states that when Alexander broke the tip off his lance he continued to thrust at the unprotected face of his enemy with the jagged end of the shaft.14 This suggests that even if the sauroter was considered as a possible secondary weapon, Alexander had neither the time nor room to reorientate his shattered lance in the press of battle to bring the butt-spike to bear. Furthermore, Xenophon details the use of the rear end of the spear during mock cavalry battles instead of the spearhead.15 This suggests that the butt-spike on the end of a cavalry lance could not inflict serious injury, even when used from the back of a moving horse. None of these passages can confirm the common use of the sauroter as an offensive weapon even by Greek or Macedonian cavalry.16 Clearly, none of these accounts can be considered a reference for use of the sauroter as a secondary combative weapon by a hoplite, or even extrapolated to assume that it was a standard battlefield practice.</br>  <br> Would cavalry EVER charge into a pikewall? <br><br>Not willingly, of course, as animals aren't stupid. But blinders on horses have been used in history to keep them charging into masses that they otherwise would not charge. Most of the time though, a pikewall would merely prevent the threat of a cavalry charge, and not necessarily be used to kill off cavalry.</br></br></br>  <br>Exploitable.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> I wonder if Cameron is in this thread. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't recall the page with the Bible but he clearly uses a saber in his fight with Thorfinn and later with Canute's army.</br>  <br>I think a lot of people said Snake's character was possibly based on the Swedish novel The Long Ships, where the main character is captured and serves as bodyguards for the Moors in Iberia. That would explain the eastern influences in Snake's armour and sword.</br>  OK you fucking military and history fags, here's a question : Is carrying a viking longboat up a fucking mountain something they did back in the old days?  <br>I don't think it was designed as a weapon either, just pointing out how you could do some of those things mentioned.</br>  Historical manga are so good.<br>'Almost' good enough to counterbalance the fucking retarded fanbases that like to call themselves 'historians' because they were too stupid to learn engineering or chemistry.<br><br>EVERY time anything historical is brought up, Armor, machines, buildings, we get faux-intellectuals crawling out of the woodwork to talk about 'inaccuracies' because it didn't match the pictures in their Osprey books.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope I get to use that.<br><br><br>Yes, but was the ability to brace a pikewall by planting the weapons necessary for warding off cavalry? I don't think so. Would bracing in a such a way be worth doing before receiving an infantry charge, do you think?<br><br><br>He could be Russian, maybe, or some other kind of East-Euro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Longboats were designed to be light, so yes, they could be portaged to switch between rivers, which was necessary during raids or traversing from the baltic to the black sea.</br>  <br> military and history fags <br>We have none of those here. We have a few dozen fat fucks who browse wikipedia on occasion and a few emigrants from /twg/.</br></br>  <br> too stupid to learn engineering or chemistry <br><br>So learning something to better yourself instead of just to get a job makes you stupid? I fucking hate STEM fags, they're the ultimate fedora tippers.</br></br></br>  <br> better yourself <br>You're no 'better' than you were in high school.</br></br>  <br>Definitely yes for cavalry, since if it's not braced, the pikeman could easily lose control of his pike. If it weren't needed, I doubt it wouldn't been insisted upon so many times throughout history.<br><br><br>/a/ has had plenty of serious history, religion, or weapon discussion depending on the series. They're rare but they're also the best I've seen on 4chan in my experience.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother replying to morons like him.</br>  <br> If it weren't needed, I doubt it wouldn't been insisted upon so many times throughout history. <br>Makes sense.<br><br><br>Does learning history improve a person any better than taking up STEM does?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> call themselves 'historians' because they were too stupid to learn engineering or chemistry. <br> implying engineering and chemistry isn't the majority of what history fags study <br>Bro do you even barobalistic throwing machines and naptha? Do you even care how methodically romans designed their encampments or about the logistics of Alexander's engineers building sophisticated attack embankments? History is hard as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Children can memorize point facts. Intelligence comes through knowledge of a system. But by all means, go ahead and continue pretending that knowing how many piercings Sardanapulus had in his cock is somehow useful.<br><br>Juat don't think you're fooling anyone.</br></br></br>  <br>It's also possible Snake's eastern influences could be explained by him being a former Varangian, or knowing a Varangian. I'm looking forward to when we see them in the manga once we reach Constantinople.</br>  <br> Intelligence comes through knowledge of a system <br>That's memorization.</br></br>  <br> Varangian <br>foreign bodyguards da best</br></br>  <br> about the logistics of Alexander's engineers building sophisticated attack embankments <br>I starting researching about that.<br>Then I got Tyre'd</br></br></br>    <br>Oh boy, it looks like the  Pun ic Wars have started.</br>  <br><br> very smart <br> a cute <br> knows how to cook <br><br>she would have made a godtier wife.<br><br>fuck thorfinn</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She still could anon</br>  <br>Read again, she doesn't know how to cook.</br>  <br>how? <br>marrying 'finn blood brother?</br></br>  <br> you've got a pretty face <br>Well, that was foreshadowing.</br></br>  <br>Is that a diving mask at bottom right?</br>  <br>Bear soup anon</br>  <br>For some reason, she reminds me of MakubeX in this page.</br>  <br> I can always take one of my workers as a son-in-law <br><br>So he was going to adopt that kind of guy or marry off his other daughter?</br></br></br>  It's literally real-life-canon that Thorfinn gets with the short-black-haired chick right? What a fucking shame that is, she's so uninteresting a character I can't even remember her fucking name. God damn.  I have to say, Hild is the first actually interesting character ever since WHEAT MOTHERFUCKER  <br><br> learning how to survive on her own <br><br>that was because of thorfinn.<br><br>so either you get a cute, smart, and pure wife who can't cook beans to save her life or a disfigured, smart, and most likely raped wife who makes damn good bear soup</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's always possible that she could hook up with the other Thorfinn.</br>  <br> WHEAT MOTHERFUCKER <br><br>Ketil?</br></br></br>  <br>You don't like full eyes?</br>  <br>I think she's still cute<br><br>But I say the same about Balalaika so what do I know</br></br></br>  <br>Hrafnkell seems fairly prosperous so a suitor would have to be roughly the same social class, and thus could afford servants/slaves to do the housework for her.</br>  <br><br>  Still, it's not definite. It's possible that she could've gone back and saw her father's corpse <br>From the storytelling point it's obvious he killed him. The words will probably be something like "Hate me and if you wish come to avenge your family." that's why she's so mad right now because he's denying what he himself told her to live for.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that seems a very likely theory to me. Hild's living on the path that Thorfinn advised, while ironically Thorfinn of now is living on the path that Hild's father advised.</br>  I like how Yukimura depicts Viking life bit I wish he would include more little daily stuff. Like when Vikings went sailing for a longer time they ate a spoonful of cranberry honey every morning to prevent scurvy and such stuff.  I only hope Hild joins them but I can't think of a reason why she'd agree to travel with her father's killer since Thorfinn's not pulling the Askeladd "you can kill me when you git gud" card.<br><br>Bummed we might not see Snake again, not to mention Thorkell and all those guys in England so I don't want to see her put aside too.</br></br>  <br>Because she secretly wants to fug. She just expresses it in strange ways.<br><br>That's why she would join them.</br></br></br>  <br>Since her family died from a viking raid, she might like the idea of making a new society free from all that. Doesn't seem like she has much ties in her current place, given her loner-vibe.</br>  <br>Cool. But then British sailors just forgot about scurvy prevention until an admiral made them drink lime juice?</br>  <br>The poms also used sauerkraut.<br>Can't say something is too rotten to eat when the whole point of it is to be fermented.</br></br>  I stopped reading after the farming started. Is it time to pick this up again?  <br>Kill yourself my man.</br>  Dirty ESL here. I've been wondering for a while, but why Full Eyes and not Big Eyes or Pop-Eyed or something like that?  So, did they already explain why they had to kill this poor guy?  <br>Because they were paid to do so, and that's all you need to know.</br>  <br>So we don't know anything else yet?</br>  <br>Everything else is absolutely irrelevant.</br>  Alright am I the only one who went searching for the chapter he killed her family after reading the last?  <br>Hopefully you're the only one stupid enough to do that.</br>  <br>It's been said a lot of times in previous threads that it was never shown in the manga.</br>  <br>Anyone following the threads could've just told you.</br>   tfw no Hild gf   <br> DID I EVER TELL YOU HOW FUCKING AMAZING WHEAT IS? <br>You are now up to speed.</br></br>  Now I'm pumped to see what Medieval Boba-Fett shit Hild is gonna bust out.<br><br>A repeating crossbow is a fucking MUST and I will spam the author's facebook with pictures of my scotum if this does not happen.</br></br>  Thanks Hox<br><br>I don't think the flashback is really needed but oh well.</br></br>  How long do you reckon Vinland Saga will be? Are we halfway through?  <br>Yukimura confirmed it'll have 20-something volumes before. So yeah, we're halfway or little past halfway.</br>  <br>They're still raising funds for the Vinland voyage.</br>  I want Hild to be Thorfinn's futire waifu. Too bad Gudrid is going to fill that role.  Which one was the best?
