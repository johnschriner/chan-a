Sorry, I'm not a drawfag but I tried  <br>How old is Guts?</br>  <br> I'm not a drawfag  <br>I can tell.</br></br>  <br>Look at it this way,when the actual drawfag isn't doing shit, you gotta man up and try.</br>  <br>Have this.  [Griffith hair is a little bitch/spoiler]<br><br> Implying I'd ever draw Griffith getting fucked by a man. <br>Miura already did it.</br></br></br> </br>  <br>You should make a doujin</br>  I want to read up on the series.<br>What sites did you guys use to read it?</br>  <br>Nig that's good, too bad your taste is shit</br>  <br><br>Thank you a lot. I don't care if I'm the only one in the world who takes them seriously, as long as I can drew them however I please I'm the happiest.</br></br>  <br>Damn, guts sure got handsome.</br>  <br>Caska shoving a sword through Griffith's midsection.</br>  To the drawfag who said he was going to draw us something. Here, take my request.<br><br>Can you draw Griffith getting fucked in the ass by Casca making the Guts face? Can you draw Puck coming out of her ass hole?<br><br>This is the guts face I was talking about</br></br></br></br>  Why can't I hold all these sacrifices?  <br>I already posted what I drew and I did it thinking about you.<br><br><br>Also, this anon already completed your request you sickfuck.<br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>That drawing is shit though</br>  <br><br>I requested Puck coming out of Casca's anus...</br></br>  <br>I don't want to be rude to the anon, but I can try to fix Casca's face in this drawing<br><br>. <br>I'm not touching Griffith though.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah griffith is fine, I just want to see Puck coming out of her asshole with like a cute face.</br>  <br> I don't want to be rude to the anon <br>Don't worry, I know it's shit</br></br>  <br>Meh, it doesn't look *that* bad.<br>Not bad enough for Guts to scream to Casca not to look.<br><br>I was expecting his face to be entirely deformed, his nose to be cut off completely, his skin to be mostly peeled off with huge infection bubbles and puss coming out of hit, his hair completely cut, his ears entirely removed only showing the inner entrance.<br>A complete destruction of his face except for his eyes.<br><br>That image just makes it look like the torturer simply peeled a bit of his skin. <br>Personally I don't understand why he didn't simply pluck both of his eyes but I guess they were needed for further suffering before the Eclipse. Griffith needs eyes to see how much he's lost.<br><br><br>Niiiice. I love it.<br><br><br> yaoi shit <br>Boring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok! I'll work on it then.</br>  <br>Go fuck yourself name.</br>  <br> go fuck yourself <br>Shoving stuff in your anus is more in your department.</br></br>  I don't get new griffeth is he evil or not?<br><br>becuz on one had his crew is all apostles and he has a division with just demons but on the other hand he did kill that muslim wizard could king and drove all of them from his land and built a utopia, <br><br>imo tbh guts is the bad guy here for wanting to kill him for personal reasons</br></br></br></br>  <br>grif is fag imho</br>  <br>I can't believe that's a real link.</br>    <br>The involvement of the entire God Hand during the creation of Falconia, and the fact that there is a huge fucking stadium full of monsters inside Falconia, seems pretty fucking ominous.</br>  <br>He's the same Griffith he always was. The only difference is as a member of the God Hand he's incapable of feeling remorse for his actions.</br>  <br> becuz <br> imo <br> tbh <br><br>Why?<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All Apostles are evil, stop being dense.<br><br> he has a division with just demons but on the other hand he did kill that muslim wizard could king and drove all of them from his land <br>They were invaders, that doesn't make him evil but it wall all according to keikaku so that the astral could be merged.<br><br> build a utopia <br>At the cost of making everywhere else toxic and inhabitable. Yeah, sure. The God Hand basically just caged the entire human race in a single location to be slaughtered. Truly a good person would do something like that.<br><br> guts is the bad guy here for wanting to kill him for personal reasons <br>How is killing for personal reasons bad if they are justified? Is killing Griffith going to stop Falconia from functioning? <br>That reasoning is flawed and false.<br><br><br>Haha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it does but maybe the new society is for demons and humans to live 2gether? <br><br><br>I did get a lot fo homo vibes from him and he did get fugged by that one rich guy I think he's bi at least <br><br>new griff doesn't seem gay at all</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh? So wanting gay shit to be drawn, being attracted to a shota isn't gay and not in your department?<br><br>I'm pretty sure you're half way from fucking yourself already.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the god hand giraffe and new Griffith are seperate entities how can he be in two places at once?</br>  <br>i think he was legit gay back when he was younger, at least bi like you said, im pretty sure he wanted guts</br>  <br> Is killing Griffith going to stop Falconia from functioning?  <br> That reasoning is flawed and false. <br><br>it's not like it's some self automating system bruh you need a strong goverment to make sure it doesn't go to shit if guts does make his way back he will fuck up a lot of shit and ruins potentially everything</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like things up my ass. I'm a top.</br>  <br>Falconia is a monarchy system.<br><br><br>Please, you're a little bitch and even Puck would be on top of you.</br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/8phqA2gkkRc  [ ]  <br>right and I'm pretty sure that system would go to shit if the king and most of his nights were killed imo</br>  <br>You need to brush up on your history. Griffith is not king. And even if he died, the bloodline still resides with Charlotte.<br><br>If Griffith died, sure, there might be some riots but someone will eventually take his place.</br></br></br>  <br> If Griffith died, sure, there might be some riots but someone will eventually take his place. <br>He's migt not be king, but he's their leader and worshipped as a god. If he dies everything will go to shi.</br></br>  <br>guts will most likely kill charlotte too imo<br><br>plus like  said ppl worship griff as a god remember in real history when jesus died the spanish inquisition was the result</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Go punch your mother.<br><br><br>Is this put together well?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's important, sure, but you're overestimating how much shit would happpen if Griffith were to vanish. It wouldn't be that bad.<br><br><br> guts will most likely kill Charlotte <br>Maybe, we'll see. He has no real reason to kill her honestly.<br>I still predict that Griffith will consummate the marriage with her and  mind break her like he did with Casca. <br><br><br>You should go punch one of your two fathers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was sat at home drinking brain fluid</br>  <br>If she's pregs with his child you can be sure guts will slay her</br>  <br>Griffith has no need of an heir.</br>  <br>He does, Guts gun kill him</br>  Griffith was so innocent pre eclipse. Guts leaving really fucked him up bad.  <br>this a pretty fucking awesome game with an amazing ost.</br>  <br>Yes and no. The voice acting for ishdoro or whatever is pretty annoying. It doesnt match him at all. Pretty sure they fucked up bot having Rickert on the Hill of Swords too. Gameplay seems really tight. It could use a remake to be honest.</br>  <br> innocent </br>  <br> so innocent <br>Not as much as you'd think he was.<br>He has his cute innocent side and his serious as fuck side.</br></br></br>  <br>is*</br>  <br> sold his ass virginity to fund his warband <br> innocent </br></br>  <br> You should go punch one of your two fathers. <br>That doesn't even make any sense. <br><br><br> Griffith was so innocent <br>So Guts should have just submitted and became his tool?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that Casca?  Kinda looks like me </br>  <br>I'm calling you gay, faggot.</br>  <br>yea telling guts to kill that old man who tried to kill him and his kid that was real innocent<br><br>also raping a child (princess Charlotte)</br></br></br>  <br><br>can you two fags leave the thread already?<br>everything was going so well with one cancerous tripfag gone, please don't ruin this</br></br></br>  <br>You can just ignore it.</br>  <br>No faggot, I didn't say that. It was good that Guts left and went onto pursue his dream. But in the end, it sort of was the reason why Griffith acted so weird and fucked Charlotte and got his ass tortured.</br>  <br>You look like an ugly mexican.<br><br><br>So if I have two fathers, I'm gay? No. I just like sweet b!p.<br><br><br>You must be new. How're the threads treating you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Tane should go fuck himself and fuck off.<br><br><br> So if I have two fathers, I'm gay? <br>It's a stereotype faglord, don't think too hard on it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You look like an ugly mexican. <br>I know that, I just said it.</br></br>  was that preacher bruh a apostle or did he turn apostle last min? tbh it was really confusing but he looked so fucking strange when I 1st saw him I was like dis nigga apostle for sure, but then he had that stupid excuse that he slams his face into the ground every day to give him that freaky ass blockface look and I don no what to think anymore  <br>It's hard for morons to ignore literally retarded random irrelevant shitposters and it's hard especially for the literal retards who suck their dicks.</br>  <br>I love how you think you're superior. How comical. Consider suicide.<br><br><br>That must suck. Sorry to hear that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I-I tried!</br>  <br>I ship it</br>  <br>tripfags &gt; image.jpg</br>  It's been so long since I caught up, where's the story even at? Why are they on the boat again?  <br>I don't need to think to recognize the obvious.<br>Consider being anally raped and getting AIDS.</br></br>  <br>I think they're destroying Enemy U-Boats right now</br>  <br>to get on another boat</br>  <br>fuck lol</br>  <br>to go to fairy island so casca can be cured which is stupid imo guts just needs to focus on killing griffith</br>  <br>Nice, you're amazing, please teach me, anon senpai!<br> K.DS <br>Do you have a  tumblr  or something like that? Also, what software are you using?</br></br></br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>  <br>You're such a dumb boy.</br>  <br>Wow, this is actually really fucking good. If only Casca fag was in the thread. I'd like him to save this. I'll save it for him, so thanks!<br><br><br>Suicide.<br><br><br>Griffith got bitchslapped by Rickert.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  <br> Tumblr <br><br>Go and stay go</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you pick this up? Fucking cuck. I hope you die. That could have been Guts and Casca.</br>  <br>Thank you so much fo your nice words. I don't use tumblr because I really despire the website. I'm also using an alias I just made up. <br>My serious art goes to pixiv and there only, but you don't need to see it as it's not berserk related.</br></br>  <br>Suicide is boring.</br>  <br>You've got enough guts and casca fanart and doujins, anon. I'm here for the bitter potential of Griffith and Casca.</br>  <br>Oh, I'm also using SAI.</br>  <br> I don't use tumblr because I really despire the website <br>I just asked because most drawfags I know use that, pls don't take offense.</br></br>  <br>I'll make more. This time, a real kissu.<br><br>Nono, don't worry. I'm aware that website is quite popula among artist  I don't get it though </br></br></br>  <br>How about some Casca and Puck or Guts and Puck? Or maybe even Guts and Farnesse? Or maybe even Puck and the other fairy.</br>  <br>no because Griffith and Casca is love, Griffith and casca is life.<br>I'll be off to draw that kissu now. God I love this.<br>See you anons in a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>Burning my Warhammer minis.</br>   Implying sign isnt THE berserk theme <br><br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=boc8<wbr>gIYWuKs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Who implied that?</br>  <br>forces is still the true berserk theme for me</br>  <br>I prefer Aria.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IrO<wbr>liVhbBo8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Sign makes me imagine an army marching and then Guts stumbles out of nowhere and kills all of them.<br><br>Aria makes me imagine of Fate and Causality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like it</br>  <br>MOOOOT.</br>  <br>What's mot</br>  <br>Tane's existence.</br>  <br>When I first read Berserk, I had a playlist of thrash metal I listened to for all the action scenes. For the more somber, melancholy moments I would listen to https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w1o<wbr>4O2SfQ5g</wbr>  [ ]</br>   Berserk thread <br> Nice <br> 70gb CP noname, Tane and Hawk <br><br>Will Berserk threads ever be rid of this cunts? Fuck off you fucking son of a bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone sounds agitated. I love your reaction to my posts. You're comical.</br>  <br>Really though, its posts like this that keeps them coming back. If we all just ignore them it'll stop feeding their egos.</br>  I just finished watching the Golden Arc movies/episodes/whatever, what's next? Do I have to read from here and if so what is it?<br><br>I'm new to Berserk but I think it's my new favorite thing I've ever seen and I want to consume every form of entertainment and development it offers</br></br>  <br>Yes, you start from the first volume as you fucking should.</br>  <br>Read the manga from volume 12 onwards.<br><br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;70 gb CP noname, <br>Who?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just read the entire manga from start to ch 337. It'll be worth it. The movies pale in comparison.</br>  <br>It's hard for morons to ignore literally retarded random irrelevant shitposters and it's hard especially for the literal retards who suck their dicks to ignore them.</br>  <br>What are you doing faggot? He's gonna miss the Black Swordsman Arc, and a lot of moments in Golden Age.<br><br>And thos 70gb thing is something that tane said he had on his old job or something.</br></br></br>  <br>now your resorted to saying the same thing twice?</br>  <br>The namefag with no name.

He has 70gb of cp, and shitposts constantly. <br>This is the funniest shit I've ever read. Goddamn.</br></br></br></br>  I knew i liked brown girls before, but Caska is on a whole other level<br><br>Could this be what they call a  heartboner? </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128100813 <br>That is the reason why you shouldn't use trips you Mom/Puck fucker.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128100813 <br>Drop the trip.</br>  <br>Oh well, I admit to my faults. Looks like we've scared noname off. That or he's typing up a fucking essay in defense of our claims. That's what he normally does.</br>  <br>At least we've got a decent drawfag  with shit taste </br>   Wyald will never be animated   <br>Nah, my computer just needed a reboot.</br>  <br> implying sign doesnt cover fate as well <br><br>Those parts where it slows down gives more prominence to the chanting in the background which feels like the song is saying behind all this chaos theres forces at work. <br><br>But aria is pretty good too.</br></br></br></br></br>  Remember when Berserk threads weren't cancerous tumors filled with tripfags who know jack shit? Half of these fuckers have actually argued the "hurr guts uses the behelit to sacrifice party" theory.  Godo best  blacksmith  and best  dad   <br>Strange. I listened to that theme during the battle of the north arc in claymore.</br>  <br>Hmm, you might be right.<br><br><br>I never argued that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I found stoner/doom to fit the theme of most <br><br>I listened to funeralopolis while reading the eclipse, it was so good i looped the song for like two hours</br></br></br>  <br> best dad <br>He fucked Erika for sure.<br>I mean, come on, an old man, in the middle of nowhere, with a loli? <br>Why do you think he just randomly snatched her up at a very young age?</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw youll never be a badass mercenary and sweep casca off her feet </br>  <br>Anon, come the fuck on.</br>  <br>I would listen to the Guts theme on loop. That or I would listen to Alice in Chains (Jar of Flies, Dirt, Facelift, the Alice in Chains album, and Mad Season). They seemed to fit well.</br>  <br> Alice in Chains <br>So, an attention whore AND a shitty taste in music?<br><br>You sure shoot for the fences of terrible, huh?</br></br></br></br>  <br> nobody cares except him </br>  <br>Don't speak to me like that.</br>  <br>See? this is why nobody likes you</br>  <br>I'll speak to you however I like, newfag.<br> inb4 not newfag <br>You've been around maybe 2 years, if that.<br>You showed up on the tails of hawk and while you aren't quite that bad, you still suck.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm not a newfag. I started tripping two years ago. I've been on 4chan since 2008. Unless that's still considered being a newfag. <br><br>Like I said, you will not speak down to me like that. It angers me and I wish you would die.</br></br></br>  <br>If you randomly kidnapped a loli and forced her to live with you, are you telling me you wouldn't do anything to her?<br>She's basically yours to do whatever and no one can stop you.<br>You could groom her into being your own cute little sex slave and make her do anything you want.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why Berserk threads these days are terrible, in a microcosm.</br></br>  <br>You're fucked in the hed dude<br><br>And don't give me that ''Where do you think you are?'' shit, you're disgusting, faggot. The only pedophile here is you.</br></br></br>  <br> people make fun of me for liking puck <br> people make fun of me to having lewd dreams of my mother <br> he posts shit like this <br> no one raises an eyebrow <br><br>You're all strange.<br><br><br>Are you saying that I'm bad? Maybe you should leave the thread of you continue to speak to me that way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the 1 out of 100?</br>  <br>You'e so fucking autist it hurts. It hurts almost as bad as knowing someone from guts's party will die</br>  <br>Whatever, newfag.<br><br>Maybe read the manga a few more times and actually experience the wait, and then you can discuss the series with adults.<br><br>I've been following this too long to deal with morons like you.<br><br>But I'm done taking your b8.<br><br>Let's post some fucking pics.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you for toning your post down a bit. I would have had to taken action if you were to continue speaking ill of me. Anyways, a death in his little JRPG party is inevitable. <br><br><br>Thank you.</br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/GgLQwE62_Q4  [ ]<br><br>Which arc would you play this?</br></br>  <br>Somewhere in the Golden age.</br>    <br>Maybe when they're out at sea. It seems to have some kind of seafaring mood to it.</br>  I'm currently reading this manga, but why does the author like riding on Griffith's dick? Why is he making him so dazzling and shit. It pisses me off considering what he did at the eclipses. <br><br>Also, does Caska stay as an autist?</br></br>  <br>I'm tempted to draw a picture of Puck getting destroyed as he screams "THIS IS YOUR FAULT [your trip]"</br>  <br> 3-4 chapters and then another hiatus <br>Whoa anon, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Miura is likely only capable of putting out one full-sized chapter, followed by a half-chapter with a hiatus notice at the end.</br></br>  <br><br> You are contributing to the cancer </br></br>  <br><br>Konami released a TCG of Berserk with unique artwork? Holy shit I need it.</br></br>  <br>Griffith is miracle of the universe</br>  <br>Not really. Is it fucked up because she's a loli?<br>A loli is simply easier to manipulate. Don't you think it's hot to have someone to listen to your every whim whom you could fuck whenever you want to?<br>Plus Godo has been alone with her for a long time, it makes it suspicious.<br><br><br>Yeah, but I don't dream about fucking my own mother, that shit is fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Uh, please don't draw anything like that. Your art style most likely sucks. Just don't even speak like that to me.</br>  <br>No he isn't. All this him being the saviour and shit is annoying. Someone just kill him already.</br>    <br>It is, specially since I have a maledom fetish, but don't you think that even thinking about Godo trying to fuck the little kid she just saved? Come on now, he's good people.</br>    <br>Both of you are as bad as each other.<br><br>You are both bastards. I hope you everyone related to you dies in the most excrutiating way possible.

Please tell me you guys have a link, I cant find them anywhere online, not even on nyaa</br>  <br>it's in youtube dude</br>  <br>bye tane!</br>  So let's be real here guys, what kind of asspull will be necessary to get a good ending for Guts?  <br>come on guy no ones reading this expecting a good end for him</br>  <br>Any chance I can get it someplace thats not Youtube?</br>  <br>Depends, can I sacrifice everyone at a Martin Luther King day parade? If so I don't even need a powerup, I'd just sacrifice all the niggers for free.</br>  Who wins? Serpico with his normal sword, or Griffith (right before he fucks princess Charlotte in Golden age arc)<br><br>Scenario one: Prep time/strategy allowed. No rules. See who the better strategist fighter is.<br><br>Scenario two: No prep time. Just see who the better swordsman is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My money would be on Serpico in both cases.<br><br>Griffith is a war strategist, Serpico is a one on one combat strategist.<br><br>Also, Guts annihilated Griffith in Golden age arc before he even went off to train for a year to improve drastically, without the dragon slayer in the flash of an eye. Serpico managed to cut Gut's face first fight, and match his speed for a bit second fight. That was after Guts was waaaaaaay stronger than when he fought Griffith and had a better sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nyaa or BakaBt I'd guess?</br>  <br>Serpico put up a much better fight than Griffith did against an even more powerful Guts. Can you imagine how shattered Griffith's pride would have been if he had known that there was not one but two swordsmen who could best him in fair combat?</br>  <br>When I realized this I was a bit disappointed.</br>  <br>Can you imagine him seducing Farnese just to fuck with Serp? He had to have picked up on his attraction, and Farnese used to be weak enough to cave to his Grif mojo.</br>  <br> Iwata </br>  <br>I think he's the false messiah type</br>  <br>Unf<br>Pre Sperg Casca is fucking top tier<br>Guts hammered that pussy<br> then he strangled her kek </br></br></br></br>  <br>A-Anon...why would you hurt me like this?</br>  <br>Just start from the beginning of the manga. Shit gets rolling after the first arc. You missed out of gay water fights.</br>  <br>I think Falconia will probably end up like skull king's empire/city, because casuality and stuff</br>  <br>I'd use the crimson one with minimal hesitation to be honest. Not even being an edgy cunt.</br>  <br>He is the real messiah, but Miura isn't a Christian and he finds the concept of messiah manipulative and evil.</br>  <br>Wtf, why would you be willing to use a regular Behelit but not Crimson?</br>  <br>Being a God Hand isn't that fun.</br>  <br>Theres actually a certain type of play in japanese culture thats very popular with the older crowd that depicts a White person (clothed, not race) is percieved as good because of the clean white appearence, when in fact he is purest evil, and does everything in his power to portrait the purest of good, who is clothed all in black as evil. Im pretty sure thats what Miura is doing with Guts and Griffith.</br>  <br>Because im not a cute girl like you</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>I doubt it. Guts is not a good guy. And Griffith clearly isn't just some evil monster who wants to kill people.</br>  <br> Griffith isnt just some monster who wants to kill people <br><br>Stop posting you heartless fuck<br>This meme is in poor taste</br></br></br></br>  <br>What meme? It's true.</br>  <br>He just wants to kill people that don't obey him.</br>  <br>Well think about the shit he's done. To humans, hes like a white angelic god. And thats just the surface. Deep down look at the shit thats happened because of him. Black at his core.<br><br>Now look at Guts. The Black Swordsman. Renegade. Killer. Criminal. And yet all the fucker does is try to get revenge for the shit Griffith did, save other humans while being a prick about it, or putting humans out of their misery from demonic possession, or they just got in his fucking way.<br><br>Pretty sure if everyone who hypes up Griffith, The Hawk of Light to commoners just ends every sentence with "and he sacrificed everyone he loved or cared for to hellspawn demon nightmares in a satanic ritual" no one would like him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. He didn't kill Guts.</br>  <br>no.<br><br>griffith was cocky, serpico was well aware of the monster that Guts is.</br></br></br>  <br>If you actually read Berserk you would know he isnt Griffith anymore, hes Femto. There are no shreds of humanity left in him.<br>You clearly missed the part in the last chapter about "the hawks black talons"<br>Dont put so much weight in appearance, Griffith or Femto is a servant of pure evil.</br></br></br>  <br>spoken like a true scumbag</br>  <br>Griffith knew full well how powerful Guts had become. He watched him fight in many battles after all and even comments during his inner monologue that he's not sure he can beat him anymore.</br>  <br> hes like a white angelic god <br>He is their god. The Idea of Evil is the human god and Griffith is its agent. The white hawk is the symbol of their religion. <br> save other humans while being a prick about it <br>He doesn't care about saving anyone except people close to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Any more of these? Where are they from</br>  <br> There are no shreds of humanity left in him <br>So? There is only his original dream and desire. Killing humans was never Griffith's dream.</br></br>  <br>shut up you</br>  <br> to achieve your dream you will need to pile up the corpses <br><br>OH yeah forgot about that kek</br></br></br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>What about fatslugs daughter? You see alot of her in this manga? The old mans daughter who turned into a zombie? He tried to save her, and ended up having to cleave the bitch in two as a mercy killing. He saves people when he feels like it.</br>  <br>Its got nothing to do with his dream anymore, he isnt the same person. He was decieved by the other godhand to make that sacrifice, now he serves The Idea. He babbles on about his dream but whos to say he even has free will anymore.<br><br>Hes still a weak backstabbing bitch that slaughtered his friends because he wanted to walk again.</br></br></br>  <br> decieved <br>Nope</br></br>    <br>What? He literally was..<br>The little floaty guy fed him that bull about having to pile up the bodies to reach the castle in the sky and Griffith thought it was his conscience. He was tricked. You really think they just give people god powers and get nothing out of it? They made him a Godhand so he could merge the worlds, and who knows whats next.<br>You really didnt read Berserk did you</br></br></br>  <br>pls no</br>  <br>Maybe if guts didnt try to rape her  ;_; </br>  <br>Why are my eyes leaking</br>   Get into figure collecting like a year ago <br> Missed Berserker Armor Guts Figma <br><br>Fucking hell, it's so expensive it hurts.</br></br></br>  <br> The little floaty guy <br><br>Ubik showed him the truth. All of what he told him was true. To hold on to his ludicrious dream, people would have to die, and die for him. Just because it's presented in a flashy way doesn't mean it's false. Think of The Count's arc. What did Ubik do? He showed The Count the truth. He showed Theresia the truth about her dad.<br><br>In the end, all apostles make the choice to commit evil willingly. Griffith was not the exception. There's a reason why their leader/master of ceremonies is represented by a big brain.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its not really tricking when the objective facts are put out in a convincing way. Griffiths actions lead to whole lot of dead people. His actions were for his goal/dream, so its not too much to say the mountain of corpses are there to help him get to his dream. The logic was pretty solid all in all. If he wasn't an invalid at that point in time I am sure he would have rejected it, but that is not how fate/causality works.</br>  <br><br>Anyone who says otherwise is full of shit. <br><br>Griffith fought beside Guts for years longer than Serpico has, yet Serpico found a way to challenge Guts on multiple occasions through strategic advantage. He also actually put up a semi-decent fight with Guts. If he used his slyph sword to make up for the fact that Guts was using an overpowered sword himself, the fight would be much more even. If he used his flying robe he probably could have stood a decent chance against Guts with Berserker armor on as well.</br></br></br></br>   Griffith fags <br> Everywhere </br>  <br> You really think they just give people god powers and get nothing out of it? <br>They say "Do as you will." Because the whole God Hand-Aposlte routine ultimately exists to create suffering to feed the Idea. <br><br>So however the apostles and GH act, despite being given instructions will increase the Idea's power. Example: Ganishka.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it was the truth <br><br>And that makes it the right thing to do does it?<br>Griffith would have achieved what he wanted if he hadnt gotten rekt by Guts and decided to penetrate the underage<br>Even after he summoned the God Hand he was hesitant, then Ubik (thanks forgot his name) gave him that flashback to the dream Griffith was always having but he twisted it.<br><br>I guess its a matter of different interpretations, whichever way you slice it what he did was wrong. So so wrong. If you have even a shred of sympathy for that dog after what he did then you arent human</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   People defending griffith <br><br>shit have we watched the same anime/manga, nigga is pure evil.</br></br>  <br> And that makes it the right thing to do does it? <br>What? No, of course not. <br><br>I was just saying that his actions are even more inexcusable because he acted knowingly. There was no twisting involved.<br><br>I'm just glad you're not a Griffith apologist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck no<br>I was just saying thats the way i interpreted it, i believe he was decieved because at the time he was desperate<br><br>Hes still a little shit and i cant wait for Guts to rape HIM next time<br>Oh man that would be glorious</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No one said it was the right thing to do, but it is the logical next step he had to take. Didnt help he was tortured for a whole fuckin year and wasn't exactly himself, but he was rescued and told everyone that rescued him to fuck off to hell. There was no twisting, it was harsh fucking daylight on his own actions. He was able to see all of the actually really shitty things he has done and he makes the decision to do some more. Griffith was never good, he had enough ability to rationalize the shit he did and relabel it. Its the same shit as freedom fighter/terrorist, point of view is a hell of a thing.</br></br>  <br> freedom fighter or terrorist <br><br>Holy shit anon I actually remember Miura saying in an interview that he was inspired by some terrorist events <br>It makes sense now</br></br></br></br>   monthly   <br> shiggy </br>      Why are most Berserk doujins either gay or loli?  <br>The first one is going to be 100 pages, the others probably the standard 40. This is how it should be. At least until it's on hiatus again by winter.</br>  <br>Because it already has plenty of hetero rape?</br>  <br> the face of a rapist </br>  <br> he isn't the same person <br>He is literally the Griffith's soul without his humanity. <br><br> to achieve your dream you will need to pile up the corpses <br>Yes, and he achieved his dream.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger hes stipped of emotion<br>What else defines a person?<br>He isnt the same person</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean he wants to kill humans for no reason. In its core it's still Griffith. Femto is Griffith's soul.</br>  <br>100+ it says. Could be 101, could be 600</br>  <br> implying hes going to let everyone in Falconia live happily ever after </br>  <br>why not?</br>  <br>This image is always so overdramatized. Like a girl would cry because a guy didnt talk to her. Bitch is insecure as shit.</br>  <br>BECAUSE HES A FREAKING DEMON DUDE JESUS<br> GRIFFITHFAGS </br></br>  <br>Do you have some sort of condition that renders you incapable of understanding humor?</br>  <br>It's just a recap anon, together with the new chapter.</br>  <br>So? I don't think you actually understand how the demons work in Berserk.</br>  <br>You clearly dont<br>Did you just skip the Eclipse or something?<br>Demons HATE humans, they feed on them for fuck sake<br>Doesnt it even seem slightly unusual to you that thise very same demons are now risking their lives for humans?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Demons are humans and not all of them hate normal humans. <br> Doesnt it even seem slightly unusual to you that thise very same demons are now risking their lives for humans? <br>No, it was explained.</br></br></br>  <br> this was explained <br>Orly<br>Enlighten me</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 33 or 34.</br>    <br>Ive read the manga roughly 5 times from beginning to end anon</br>   Caska gets her memory back. <br> Becomes despondent, emotionally unstable and hates Guts for not saving her/shaken and keeps remembering the eclipse. <br>OR<br> Guts decides to leave her as she is because she's happier this way. <br>Which one do you think is more likely?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read it again.</br>  <br>Its not explained youre just trying to discredit me<br><br>The fact is we dont know for sure what his intentions are. But its extremely unlikely Griffith and the Apostles are suddenly good guys now. Since they live off suffering, and the literally sold their souls to evil.<br><br>So fuck you nigger im out PEACE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does "good guys" mean? <br> they live off suffering <br>They don't. <br> and the literally sold their souls to evil <br>Which in Berserk world is basically human selfish desires.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guts for not saving her <br>But he tried so hard. He cut off his own arm just to get a chance at rescuing her.</br></br>   they finally get to elfhelm and see the king <br> they have to kill some crazy elf demon god monster so the king will fix Casca <br> they do it but guts is bed ridden again so elf king fixing Casca <br> it's like skull knight said maybe she didn't want to get fixed <br> as Casca tries to kill herself her shadow babeh tries to stop her so Casca kills her kid then herself <br> guts finds near death Casca she says she hates him for fixing her  <br> he goes berserk and destroys half of elfhelm before loliwitch can stop him <br> elf king banishes his party off the island knowing that he couldn't do shit to guts <br> what a horrible night to have a cruise </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all of them. I think it's implied higher class ones like Zodd can control themselves better, like when he refused to partake in "indulgence" when the eclipse was happening and just waited outside. Most of the knights of the apocalypse seem to have at least somewhat bit of honor. The weaker more useless ones are the ones who just want to eat humans, and they get fucked up by greater apostles for it.</br>  <br>What are you even trying to say now? What the fuck do you think i mean you actual mongoloid<br><br>Youre trying to tell me that Griffith has his kingdom, so the fact that he is a rape hungry soulless monster that can squash matter with his mind is completely void now. Hes a good guy, even though he is a servant to the idea of evil. Even though he slaughtered his followers and has shown his demonic side time and time again.<br><br>How will Berserk end then? Griffith having his happy tea parties in Falconia while Guts is fucking around with the little shota elves on that island?<br><br>Pls anon PLS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So im on ch 280. Does this kushan emperor really stand a chance against griffith/femto?  <br>Calm down m8 the chapters coming</br>  <br>Why dont you keep reading and find out?<br>Dont ask /a/ anything unless you want huge spoilers out the ass</br></br>   implying he's back   Fucking hell I have trouble believing griffith is a man. Hes so fucking pretty. I dont know if I wanna bone him or if I wanna let him bone me. Its maddening. No wonder griffith fags exist.  <br>Triple dubs confirm.</br>  <br>Cmon, you know how this is gonna go down.<br><br> Caska regains her memories <br> Denies and pretends it was a dream <br> Sees Guts; Tired, Worn, Ageing <br> 2-3 chapter panic, everyone trying to console her <br> Farnese says some shit like "you dont even know how lucky you are, me luv him long time" <br> She heads back and looks at him again <br> All the scars, the ageing, the armor <br> in her mind, she'll think it was all for her <br> She'll cry, they'll kiss, she gets left on Safety Island or joins the new Black Order or whatever you wanna call Guts ragtag group. <br><br><br> Rickert either gets murdered, has to watch Godo's daughter get rape-murdered, or they join the Black Order. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck /a/. Griffith is like the fucking lord of prep time. First he pulls out the queen, then the pope. It almost writes itself.  <br> Ella getting raped <br><br>But she'll be doing the raping this time. Lolis are notorious sexual predators.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah yes the infamous mololisters</br>  <br>Remember that a vote for Casca is a vote against 70 gigs and tripfags.</br>  <br>Maximum autism.</br>  <br>Gennon pls.</br>  <br> Implying he wasnt one lucky fuck </br>   you will never yell orders at your naked brown waifu <br><br>why live</br></br>  <br> filthy frank </br>  <br> not using a Dark Horse scan <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  Why the fuck does capn hook even exist? Will they even get off the damned boat? You know how it is with miura.  <br>done the of the drawing rest for you</br>  <br>I think we should be carefully optimistic about getting off the boat now that we get it monthly. <br>I mean I know I wont live to see the end but I think I now have a chance to get off the boat.</br></br>  Why is there so little porn of something so popular with so much fap fuel? <br><br>Alternatively, how much would it take to get Miura to just draw porn?</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what I'm looking at, is this Black Swordswoman Casca giving Griffith karmic revenge?</br>    <br>Its casca winking at Guts after getting her memories back and running to her true love.</br>  <br><br>In case you needed more convincing<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Theres already alot of sex though thats pretty explicit.</br>  <br>So what is this saying?<br>Everyone in Falconia is going to sacrificed for nothing?</br></br>  <br>I don't see the difference.</br>  <br>Holy fuck I need these cards<br><br>I cant find shit online they must be really fucking rare<br><br>I NEED IT<br>I THOUGHT I OWNED EVERYTHING BERSERK RELATED</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wtf..... he actively allowed EVERYONE in the band of the hawk to be sacrificed so that he could become femto. meaning GUTS included. i think you are missing the entire point of the eclipse and how it pertains to where guts is now.</br>  Why do I have this strong feeling that puck was the elf king all along and hes just pretending to be some random asshole for reasons?  <br>Man that's a sexy jaw<br><br>Why does Guts have Batman's jaw?</br></br></br>  <br> dark knight <br>Guts is Batman.</br></br>  Reminder that somehow Griffith is going to get tricked during a ceremony where he summons spirits and instead of bringing comforting shades to his subjects, it's going to be the ghosts of the sacrificed Band of the Hawk. And that'll be the real beginning of the end for Falconia.  <br> Puck could have cured Casca all along <br> likes being inside her mouth too much to do that </br></br>  What do you guys think of this scenario?<br><br> Elf magic un-potatoes Casca <br> News of Griffith's kingdom reaches the party and, like Rickert, they want to see Griffith <br> Travel ensues, adventures are had, Guts gets stronger, Falconia is reached <br> Griffith reached, nice chat ensues until Griffith decides he has business to finish and sacrifices to collect. <br> Griffith v Guts, it's close but   Guts loses, Griffith sacrifices Casca and then Guts sacrifices Griffith  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It won't be happening. If Guts gets any stronger than he is now he could destroy Griffith.</br>  <br>He  isn't yet .</br>   With each arc guts looks more and more miserable, agonized and pained <br> He also gets new scars and is aging fast <br><br>Fucking shit he'll look like hes 80 by the time the manga ends.<br><br> If it ends. </br></br></br></br></br>  Where were you when Rickert fucking called it?  <br>He's definitely strong, but probably not Skull Knight strong, and Griffith is pretty much deity level. There's some gap there where Guts overcomes one or more of the armor's massive drawbacks before he's ready.</br>  Until the next idolm@ster comes out.  <br> Implying hes isnt taking it like a joke because he is THE elf king </br>  <br>He's going to turn into Blacksmith-Senpai</br>  I just reached chapter 144 after two long nights of reading.<br><br>Does the ride keep going?</br></br>  <br>shiiiiieeeet nigga</br>   How will Griffith/Femto end? <br>The "Black Swordsman" arc has just begun. The axis will be, obviously, the story in which Guts' feud with the God Hand, who Griffith/Femto belongs to, will be brought to a close. Let's think about the development leading to the finale.<br>First of all, what is the goal of the God Hand now that it's composed of 5 members? It is naturally expected that if Guts can't find it out, he won't even be able to confront them. Before that, is the God Hand complete with the addition of Femto?<br>"Hmm, for now the God Hand is supposed to be complete with Femto. I'm sorry but now is not a good time, as expected, to reveal their goal... Instead, I'll give you one hint. The keyword is "Void". You can imagine many things based on it." said Miura.<br><br><br> Void confirmed for final boss of the series </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Griffith is the antechrist</br>  <br>But skull knight is the one destined to destroy voids asshole.</br>  <br>I just can't see any member of the Godhand being defeated through physical means, no matter how powerful the opponent is. I don't think Guts will be able to win like that and will be forced to settle with a stalemate of sorts where Griffith and the others are thwarted (but not destroyed) and Caska is more or less recovered. It would bring resolution to the story without being retarded.</br>  <br>What if  the Idea needs another hand </br>  <br>Where did that quote come from?</br>  <br> Idea of Evil confirmed for final boss of the series <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br> mangareader <br>You disgust me.</br></br>  How powerful would ganishka, the kushan emperor, be if he had his end beast powers to his full control?  <br>Exactly as powerful as shown, which was nigh unstoppably so.</br>  <br>Godo is best old wise man character</br>  <br>I prefer to look at it as him being determined, not quite as enraged as you make him sound.</br>  <br>He may be old but he isn't the wisest.</br>  Does Caska ever get her memories back? I'm currently reading the manga and I can't stand how much of a fucking retard she is.  <br>FUCK you m8.</br>  <br> likes a ruined character </br>  <br>What I mean is that Casca is retarded now for 22 years. He doesn't know our pain. <br><br>I'm glad I'm a westerner who is waiting for her to get better for JUST 10 years now.</br></br></br>  <br>Has her condition been healed yet?</br>  <br>Summer brings the attention seeking newfags in</br>  <br>No. <br>We only got a hint that she is probably going to hate it when it happens.</br></br>  I'm at Volume 12 and I'm scared at what's gonna happen.  <br> chapter 12 <br>I envy you.<br>Although I can't really believe what happens next was never spoiled to you.</br></br></br>  <br>**Volume</br>  <br>I heard of it but its my first time reading berserk.</br>  <br>Then GTFO the thread and read it before someone spoils it for you.</br>  What is the best way to buy Berserk in English?  <br>But Rickert slapping Griffith was a better end than anywhere he's gonna leave Guts on the ocean.</br>  One thing I like really is that Guts is still young enough to not have his personality changes feel forced for the sake of plot.   gigantosumthing <br>Christ I completely forgot Miura dumped Berserk to draw this thing no once cared about.</br>  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was an outside force guiding Guts through his life similar to the Idea of evil.  <br>Causality, ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>Guts should've submitted himself to Griffith. It would've been for the best</br>  So what does Skully actually DO?  <br>say deep stuff that doesn't make any sense</br>  <br>I mean on his non-plot-device days.</br>  <br>He ruled an empire or some shit.</br>  <br>He is flying on his magic skelehorse and kills apostles to collect their behelits. At least thats what he was doing before griffith shenaningans with falconia</br>  <br>Yeah it seems likely that he is Gaiseric and Void was the advisor/gay lover he locked up.<br>Hope we get a bit more exposition on that, on a reread right now and I don't think anybody who meets him (except Guts) ever knows enough to have a hunch about who he really is.</br></br>  <br><br> implying Retard Caska doesn't also put him up her cooch  <br> implying he doesn't enjoy being in a woman's softest, comfiest place more than her mouth which has teeth </br></br></br>  <br><br>This is actually a good point, if there is an Idea of Evil there must also be an Idea of Goodness. However, it would somewhat hurt the narrative that Guts is just a tenacious, hard-as-nails dude put into the worst possible circumstances trying to make his way in the world.</br></br>  <br> ywn live inside Casca's safe </br>  <br> Spas Cas sticks him up there <br> she gets Femto Eclipse flashbacks <br><br>Trips and she enjoyed it.</br></br></br></br>  I think what's going to happen with Caska getting her memories back will be something along the lines of the grief and trauma being too severe for her to handle, so she attempts to kill herself, only for Puck of all people to be the one who manages to convince her not to do it, because he's come to know Guts and how he feels about her and how desperately he needs her.  So is Caska going to remain an autist? Why would she hate to go back to normal?  <br>She will certainly go back to normal some time in the far far future, the problem is what happens afterwards.</br>  <br>Remembering the incident that ended with all her friends getting killed, her lover being horribly maimed and her getting brutally raped might have something to do with it. Not many people have Guts' ability to put up with shit, and taking a look at the world now, it's strange that more people aren't simply retreating into their shell like Casca is.<br><br>How many times has she attempted to kill herself already, anyway? Elf Island is paradise, she might wander around for a couple of chapters and meet the rest of Guts' pals before making a decision, and it's not like nobody can restrain her if she tries to top herself.</br></br></br>  Why doesn't Guts grow facial hair? He's got testosterone oozing out his pores, doesn't he?  <br>He's Japanese.</br>  <br><br>Not everyone can grow good facial hair, that's just genetics. <br><br>That or he shaves regularly, which is likely since he served as a soldier.</br></br></br></br>  I want Griffith to get the worst death possible.  <br>He probably just shaves when he finds time. I mean you don't see his hair grow too much either.</br>  <br> 3-4 chapters and then another hiatus <br><br>Hiatus 5 year long.</br></br></br>  <br>His design looks much better without a beard.</br>  <br>You need to learn basic pattern recognition.</br>  <br>He obviously cuts his hair regularly so he probably shaves as well.<br>And if you don't have shaving foam its also more important to shave more often which would explain why he doesn't show any stubble.<br><br>And there is also the genetics side of things.<br>I met a guy in boot who was 20 years old and did not have a single hair on his lower face. No Asian or African genes, pure north Europe and Scandinavian ancestry.<br> mfw I had to do a silky smooth shave everyday to avoid re-inspection </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Opinions</br>  <br>is that fucking filthy frank?</br>  <br>Give him a handlebar mustache with mutton chops.</br>  <br><br> newfags cannot recognize Miura without making comparisons to Frank-san </br></br>   Read golden age <br> Pic related <br><br>GRIFIIIIIIIIIIIIITH</br></br></br>  <br>Griffith a cute.</br>  <br>I'm gonna laugh when Guts and Griffith both die in the last chapter.</br>  <br>I think you'll actually be pretty sad.</br>  I'm hyped  <br>Giffithfags are comparable to cucks. They'd let their whole family be slaughtered and still pledge loyalty to the white  falcon </br>  Is Guts edgy?  <br>He's still going to be ugly anyway. These are reminders that Mihawk is the strongest swordsman in the world and he's the most handsome man in the world. Guts is a weak swordsman and he's ugly. Only retarded butthurt homosexuals would say otherwise. Everything I said are facts.</br>  <br>Nice buzzwords, moeshitter.</br>  <br>What are those things on the plate in that poster?</br>  <br> image.jpg <br><br>every time</br></br></br>  <br>Guts during the Black Swordsman Arc was edgy but you have to consider that was just after the eclipse happened.</br>  <br>so I'm reading all that for fucking nothing?<br><br>shit</br></br></br>  <br>It feels like Miura toned him down a little once we get back to the present at the start of the Conviction arc.<br>He's still a bit edgy but not in such an aggressive way. And wasn't the start of BS about two years after the Eclipse?</br></br>  <br>I think he is around 25-30 at this point.</br>  <br>Is this a joke? Your moe crew cannot take JOJO/Berserk/your least favourite anime away from /a/, Nagi.</br>  <br>Does this image trigger you?</br>  <br>You know, I never realized what he meant by adult attack until I reread this whole chapter.  I'm retarded </br>  <br>And even Rosine wants Guts' dick.</br>  <br>Why are you in every berserk thread with trash posts like this?

Good lord the motherfuckers in these threads are dense. He clearly knows enough about Erika and Godo's backstory to be aware of this page. From there you can infer that he's just fucking with you.<br><br>If I started saying I was literally Zeus I bet you would earnestly argue with me about it.</br></br></br>  <br>He also runs into more than his fair share of little girls.</br>  <br>Yeah. They lived in a time before CPS. These things happen.</br>  <br>He shaves his face with his dagger, just like his dad taught him.</br>  <br>Anyone who has ever shaved with a knife knows how much this shit hurts.</br>  I've always wondered what Zodd really is.<br>Skully claimed he was some sort of Gatekeeper/guardian at the Eclipse and here he talks about the Apostles like they're a seperate type of creature from himself.</br>  <br> Miura's Lustful Little Lolis. <br>He really does like them young.</br></br>  <br>I did that once and cut out half of my cheek.</br>  <br>Perhaps these are two paths Guts might take. Getting consumed literally by the berserker armor and becoming skully v2 or making a sacrifice and becoming an eternally wandering warrior</br>  <br>All the other apostles have much more abstarct designs but Zodd looks like something out medieval mythology.</br>  <br><br>I've always seen Forces as a theme song of sorts for Berserk. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yhx<wbr>8yVvmM5k&amp;list=PL9146BDACDA5C450A&amp;in<wbr>dex=9</wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>But Guts theme has always been my favorite Berserk song.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dIo<wbr>ILN_KrhU&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL9146BDACDA5<wbr>C450A</wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Future developments:<br><br>Guts kills at least one party member in armor-fueled rage;<br><br>Casca regains her senses;<br><br>Rickert dies;<br><br>Femto kills at least one rebellious apostle;<br><br>Elven island gets invaded<br><br>Agreed?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You are a couple of clumsy fucks ain't ya?</br></br>  <br>You have no idea how sharp a blade has to be to cut hair comfortably.<br><br>It isn't cutting yourself that is the problem.

What a shame.</br>  Boys aren't meant to do this to me what's happening /a/ help  <br>Are you me?<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>A bunch of  girls . The trap and his friend agreed to help out, and ended up in an orgy while their guy friends watched them change.

I think fit tummies are cute.

When soft, everything's held in place nicely, then if you start thinking about cute fuccbois and get an erection,  the tension of the material on your dick can be kind of hot. </br>  <br>these are the new designs, the old ones looked like Final Fantasy characters</br>  <br>there is even more tension and tightness to hold your dick in place if you wear panties instead of briefs</br>  <br>Yes.  4u. <br><br><br>Nevermind, you  have a much qter size  than me.</br></br></br></br>  the great part about Kobayashi is that he was written in fucking 1930 and even then was still canonically a trap that Akechi probably fucked.  <br> tfw I want to buy some for this reason <br>God dammit, I want this so bad.</br></br>  <br>If you're that short you should become an actor like DeVito.

Has she mastered the LoliRocket technique?  <br>But it's awwwwright.</br>  <br>thank mr. skeltal</br>  <br>Because Quzilax is almost always a complete piece of shit who doesn't understand that lolis deserve a happy ending.</br>  <br>Astarotte no Omocha is pretty solid. Plus there is always loliball. Though honestly, it is hard to beat Ichigo Mashimaro.</br>  <br>Its not always about the loli.</br>  <br> Astarotte no Omocha is pretty solid. <br>It's bad. The bane of lolicons are /ss/ elements, and LnO swims deep in it.</br></br>  <br>That show was too lewd for my tastes. I prefer loli sexuality in my anime to be more subtle.

I'll be fine.</br>  <br>Have you tried Fat lolis: The misunderstandening?</br>  <br>But you can overlook those parts right? I mean, these two alone are worth watching it for.</br>  <br>That's true. Have you tried Kanamemo? Not an all loli cast but there are some cute ones in it.</br>  <br>Yeah, I liked Mitsudomoe, but despite the raunchy jokes, I found the lolis more cute than sexy, unlike the Ichigos.</br>  <br> &gt;sexualizing  <br>You don't have to put it in such a bad way.</br></br>  <br>How would you put it?</br>  <br> plump loli <br> age gap yuri <br> milf <br>yes please<br>http://exhentai.org/g/341837/7e7fc8<wbr>0a94/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's from season 2</br>  <br>Not when she's asleep.</br>  <br>Cuz it gets my dick hard.</br>  <br>They are pretty much perfect, but the show doesn't deliver on them. Somehow it feels dry.</br>  <br>Miku's mom was the best</br>  <br>Something about older women teaching young girls how to love just gets me hard as diamonds every time. It's such a shame that age-gap yuri is so god damn niche.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>There should be no reason why a person with a healthy disposition should be attracted to children;<br><br>  Attraction is rooted in the biological need to propagate the species. <br>  Children cannot fulfill the role of propagating the species. <br>  Evolution has made it so that attraction can only happen to those who perceive a potential mate as able to reproduce. <br>  Thus, persons are only supposed to be attracted to potentially fertile persons. <br><br>If a person finds attraction in a child, then something is very wrong biologically.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NO</br>  <br>Gotta admit, mother x daughter can move me pretty intense too. <br>Imagining how this semen demon's mother grabs my dick and puts it into her daughter's mouth and excitedly waiting for me to supply her daughter with much needed semen doesn't leave me cold.</br></br>  <br>So you're supporting attraction to pubescent lolis?</br>  <br>But children are cute and none of us is going to reproduce anyway.</br>  <br>Try this shit.<br> http://exhentai.org/g/628370/351c2f<wbr>a51d/</wbr> <br>Misleading title and cover, this shit never fails to make me hard as fucking diamonds.</br></br></br>  <br> So you're supporting attraction to pubescent lolis? <br><br><br> If a person finds attraction in a child, then something is very wrong biologically. <br><br>By definition, children *cannot* reproduce: therefore, no attraction can happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fantasy, there is nothing wrong with it.<br><br>Also, Japan has a different ideal about feminine beauty: they want young, cute girls. <br>Add that to how manga always makes everyone seem 10-25 years younger and, voila: lolis.<br><br>Japanese men do not want toddlers, they want young girls, that's all.<br><br>There are pedos in Japan, sure, but there is at least one in your hometown too, so, nothing special there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> By definition, children *cannot* reproduce: <br>Also by definition children are prepubescent, thus that statement has no bearing on my question.</br></br>  <br>Natural selection never works in such a clear cut, simple way. If that were the case, homosexuality would have quickly died out as an aberrant behaviour, instead of having a long history as well as being noted in many other species. It's also possible that behavioural elements that predispose someone to find pre-pubescent females as sexy is linked with other traits that marginally improve fitness.</br>  <br> none of us is going to reproduce anyway <br><br>Biology is hard wired anyway: doesn't matter if the *potential* mate is *actually* infertile.<br><br>If the mate *looks* like someone for whom reproduction is possible, then attraction is possible.<br><br>Otherwise, no attraction at all... for a healthy person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That should be not related to anime. It just sexualizes whatever the masses find appealing or arousing, and lolis were always among those things.<br><br>But just to humor you, I'm gonna point out some things about biology, and use nature as a ground.<br> adult males are attracted to young (that refers to child) females, as they want to secure their position of being the first with a female the moment she first bleeds <br> alpha males have the right to claim any girl they find that first bleeds for themselves </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Five year olds have had kids <br> therefore five year olds look like someone possible to reproduce <br> therefore it is healthy to find five year olds attractive. </br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon, I'll give it a peak when I'll have time.<br> I don't want to look now because I'm not in a situation right now where soiling my pants would be wise. </br></br>  <br><br>Because they're not children at all. They're NOT REAL.</br></br>  <br>I don't like it when Yuri incest gives me a boner.</br>  <br><br>Define "children".<br>Most girls at 11-12 can reproduce. Are they not children then?</br></br></br>  Real children are fucking gross, and the idea of sexualizing one repulses me. Lolis are made to be sexualized.<br>God help you if you don't love the loli, though</br>  <br>B-but I have a huge forehead and the Schneider cut hides that</br>  <br>No, they aren't. Children refers to pre-pubescents, thus girls under 10-11 and boys under 11-12.</br>  Finally, Yuzu and Yugo will appear more often than every 5 or so episodes again.  <br>Well Reiji/LDS figures out how to create them later, so don't worry about it, Yuya isn't a speshul snowflaek for long.</br>  <br>Or at least turning his regular cards into pendulum cards. We know that Odd-Eyes, Stargazer, and Timegazer all started out as regular monsters.</br>  <br>LDS figures out how to make them 'stable' or whatever, and the number of pendulum users grows beyond just Yuya and Reiji. And it's implied that everyone worldwide will be working at incorporating pendulums with their decks.</br>  Fuck this SHIBERUUUUUUU bullshit. Are retarded catchphrases popular in japan's youth?<br>That fat kid will grow up to be a pedophile. Just like Marco sensei.</br>  <br>Japan has shit taste, more news at 11.</br>  R8 and h8.  I don't know Murce kinda looks off on that pic.  Perhaps Zeta Gundam wasn't what you wanted to see. Perhaps you were expecting a hotblooded, fanciful super robot show like Jeeg or Star Driver. No.<br><br>Gundam is about war. Gundam is about WAR, and although it uses some science fiction elements, it's dead serious about that. In war, people don't end up happy and liberated. I'm not surprised Americans don't understand this, but true war is a downward spiral for all involved.</br></br>  <br>6/7</br>  <br><br>I don't think I can hate anything with Gally in it.</br></br>  <br>But LO Gally a shit</br>  <br> "serious", previously group-approved safe-picks <br>Get a mind of your own, OP.</br></br>  <br>I don't get how that relates to the thread<br><br>But I agree</br></br></br>  <br>Sauce middle-right and bottom-right?</br>  <br>Vinland Saga and Shut Hell.</br>  I don't think these are the 9 greatest manga ever written, but these are the 9 that I've enjoyed the most.

Because there is a pretty big distinction between the two</br>  <br>I assumed it was the anime, 1.5/2 in that case.</br>  <br>Top-right and bottom-middle?</br>  <br>6/6<br><br><br>7/7<br><br><br>-1 Lucifer &amp; Biscuit<br>5/6<br><br><br>7/7<br><br><br>Well, you like Ai-Re, so that makes you a bro, no matter your fetishes.<br>-1 Oreimo though<br>6/7<br><br><br>7/13</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ai-Ren*</br>    <br>No one who like's Ai-Ren can be a bad person. <br>As for Oreimo, does <br>make a difference, or did you just not like it, period</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read the LN. Didn't care enough to read it.<br>It probably might make a difference but meh.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, sauce on the top right, middle middle and bottom middle? The very middle reminds of of Nausicaa from the art.</br>  <br>It does make a difference, because Kirino is nowhere near as abusive, and is a much better person. Plus the ending isn't left to interpretation. The anime is just shit. But to each his own</br>  <br>Yeah, I've hear similar stories.<br>Well, I'm rating it in regards to what I've seen, which is the anime, so meh.</br></br>  <br> vinland saga <br><br>But why?</br></br></br>  <br> vinland saga <br><br>why not? That's the real question.</br></br></br>    <br>are you the real Bear?</br>  <br>I am. I actually just started watching Parasyte, good stuff.</br>  <br>You should read the manga instead.<br>I dropped the anime near ep 6-8 or something (after the merge), I really felt like the anime dragged for some reason.<br><br>On a side note, I've finished installing Aya, and will read it any day now. Probably. Hopefully.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is your opinion on melancholic stories that don't really have a happy ending, and have the potential to make your cry like a little bitch?</br>  <br>I'd assume he likes them if SR is on his vn 3x3<br><br><br>I'll consider it, possibly. Maybe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was going to advise that he read Kana Imouto.</br>  <br>That actually seems pretty interesting, and I like your description of it. It's on my backlog now.</br>  <br>Anything that makes me feel emotions has succeed as art. I just want to enjoy a good story.<br><br><br>It's on my list of VNs backlog to read, which I've already downloaded, but haven't read yet. I heard that it's pretty emotional and I really want to read it but I haven;t had a chance to yet.<br> I've probably been subconsciously avoiding it because it's a sad story and I have an imouto. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it's not a happy vn, so don't go into expecting happiness. It has some happy parts, and Kana is fucking adorable. <br>But this VN made me cry like a fucking bitch. So just steel your hearts when reading it.</br></br></br>  It's almost time for this season's battle harem that's a loose mix of Chrome Shell Regios meets Ar tonelico.<br><br>Let's take it easy and have a comfy thread.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm only watching because you said Ar Tonelico and if it doesn't live up to it I'm going to be mad at you anon</br></br>  <br>he also said battle harem</br>  <br>Oh, it is that time of the week. I know some people are disappointed and probably dropped this, but I'm still watching this. The MC is good and I've the aerial setting and apocalyptic premise. <br><br>Anyways, I'm all for comfy and fun threads. It isn't to late to have World Break kinds of threads despite certain posters that wants threads to burn.<br><br> Ar tonelico <br>I get the Regios comparison, but how does Ar tonelico fit into this?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I've <br>I love*</br></br>  I want to buttfuck Misora.  <br><br>https://my.mixtape.moe/ytflrk.webm<br><br>I had to go made this. Animated pictures with music are worth a thousand words. There aren't reyvateil or hymmnos, but dat vibe is there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>red is worst girl blue best</br>  <br>I managed to watch the 5 harems of a couple seasons ago.<br><br>Will I enjoy this? What archtype of girls are there? Is the Tsundere the main?<br><br> I like tsuns </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get in line.<br><br><br>Maybe.<br>Usual tsundere, kuudere, hajidere, genki kohai, deredere childhood friend<br>Yes.  And she's the best girl so far. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> loose mix of Chrome Shell Regios meets Ar tonelico. <br><br>Picked the fuck up.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chrome Shelled Regios sequel never</br></br>  <br> Yes. And she's the best girl so far. <br>Picked the fuck up, shame it's fucking FUNi.</br></br>  <br>You're right about that. I just hope the battle harem aspects don't fuck up a decent premise/setting too much. I already kinda dislike pretty much all three of what appear to be the main girls but maybe they'll be better after the first episode.</br>  Oh fuck. I forgot Chrome Shelled Regios existed. Fuck. Now I remember that there will never be a sequel.  <br><br>Sadly so, but CSR's LNs are fully translated save the gaidens. Take comfort in that. It was a good ride and a wonderful end for Layfon and Felli. The story may have ended, but their journey continues on. I'm pretty satisfied with that since I'm a sucker for that kind of ending, especially when the two of them  came back powerhouse mutants. </br></br>   Dropped 1 minute into episode 1 <br>We've got a winner how most egregious piece of shit this season.</br>  <br>I think it's trying to communicate with us.</br>  <br>World Break bro here. I still have some hope. Either way, I won't drop this show. There are too many things that are relevant to my interests that'll make me keep watching. <br><br><br>I'm so going to grab the OST at first chance.</br></br></br></br>   mc will not omoideshita how to fuck the girls <br><br>rip</br></br>  <br>why they call him a traitor?</br>  <br>If spoilers are true, it's because the MC survived when his team got wiped out. People thought he ran away or something.</br>  <br>AR tonelico is full of tsundere so is this anime.</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116216 <br>Learn to type, m80.</br></br>  <br>But all of the best girls are not tsundere at all, only the shit ones are. Mir is pretty much the polar opposite of a tsundere, and most of the goddesses are too autistic to have feelings.</br>  <br>if I learn anything from antz is that if you come back as the lone survivor from a massive war they don't think you hide under the bodies of the falling until everyone is dead but you are a god and need to be worshipped</br>  <br>Not him, but Shurelia, Mir, Finnel, Cocona, and Cas are the best girls. Mir, Finnel, and Cas are tsundere, so that's half right there. <br><br>Mir is beyond a shadow of doubt a tsundere. The second game, the drama CDs, and the toukousphere are in agreement. Mir is technically a kuutsundere, so she's part kuudere.<br><br> At <br> shit girls <br>Pick one, fag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We use so many paradigm to make them less tsundere to make them whole heartedly trust the MC and finally submit to their love also bring them confidence. Is not that different</br>  <br>The MC also a teacher the same as the ar tonelico protag to make the girls show their true power.</br>  <br>Shit taste, and Mir isn't tsun at all, did you even play the goddamn games? She doesn't even give a shit if you see her naked, a tsundere would slap the shit out of you for seeing her panties.<br><br>Mir and Aurica are the best girls. AT2 Cocona is slightly below, along with Filament and Shurelia. Metafalica has the best music but no good girls other than Cocona and Mir/Jakuri.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget tsundere Akane. She deserves a mention. And let's not forget the best boys of EXA_PICO that are tsundere too. There are quite a few of them.<br><br>On a somewhat related but different note. Where is that one anon who was working to compile a nigh-complete collection of EXA_PICO music/drama CDs/special albums/etc? I hope he is stilm alive and well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you watch all of those? I couldn't get through an episode of either Absolute Duo or Isuca.</br>  <br>If you managed to finish Isuca than you can stomach everything of this genre</br>  <br> Disagreeing with all-around perfectly accept and great taste <br>Really?<br><br> She doesn't even give a shit if you see her naked <br>Mir didn't know the concept of shame, idiot. Of course she wouldn't be bother by that, especially if humans sees her. She looks down on humans and thinks they're like, well, insects after all. <br> a tsundere would slap the shit out of you for seeing her panties. <br>You obviously no idea what tsundere means and are stuck on a very narrow minded definition of tsundere. You're even going against word of God. <br> Aurica  <br> best <br>Even though there aren't any real bad girls, I would have to consider Aurica as just mid tier. She isn't that great. <br><br>Mir was always best above all. But since Cas came along, that spot can be vied for. Nay-san can also be a likely contender.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AD was great, Isuca was godawful and I only watched it for Isuca being dere</br>  <br> He didn't watch Absolute Duo for Julie and Isuca for Sakuya <br>You're missing out imo. Sure, they are a lot of things wrong (especially for Isuca), but it's the girls that you should watch for. Some of the battles in Absolute Duo are quite awesomely animated and have cool choreography too, so there's that</br></br>  <br> Isuca for Sakuya <br>How fucking retarded</br></br>  <br>The anime doesn't do justice to her as she should be like in the manga, but she's still quite adorable and deliciously sex. Isuca is also good too though, I suppose.

I searched archive to the best of my ability to be sure, but I don't see any recent At/EXA_PICO threads, thus no update from that anon. I can only assume it also hasn't happened yet.</br></br>  <br>It is. <br>Its just that Blade Dance thread turn into shitstorm immediately since the anime aired.</br></br>  I don't even know why I even bother giving harems a chance every season.<br><br>It's all the same shit.</br></br>  <br>People just need to accept that Claire is best girl, threads would be much better then.</br>  <br>They could be good if the MC is entertaining or at least not a generic blushing retard, like in this case</br>  <br>Claire is at least about high tier. But you know most don't care to shitpost and vocally hate her though. It's a small group of vocal anti-fans that make noise and causes shitstorm. That's about true for most fanbases that has issues with a combative loud bunch that burns threads to stroke their taste.</br>  <br>I'm not sure as well, things are quite hectic so I rarely browse /a/.<br><br>Maybe next month, at least another EXA_PICO thread might pop up. This month's EXA_PICO thread is not yet being started. (Unless this is this month's thread)</br></br></br>  <br>How can it be?

No Reyvateils and Hymmnos can be excused because different of universe and setting, but godly music should at least be present, preferably in some made-up language. The soundtrack here  is pretty close to Ar tonelico's tune of music, but it isn't enough. I suppose we'll have to see though.</br>  This show is rather bad. Let's have an AT thread instead.<br>Mir is best Reyvateil</br>  <br>Yes, it has a good art and CG.</br>  <br>Alight.

I'm sure of it.</br></br>  <br>I caught most of it, just missed some of the finer details.</br>   They actually explained it   <br> I got hated and given a nickname because I failed other's people expectations.  <br><br>Welcome to life, you fucking faggots.</br></br></br>  Man, this MC knows how to sweet talk and come out on top unfazed against these girls.  <br> who's simply haughty about her own abilities <br>So yeah she's simply a bitch</br></br>  More stitch porn incoming.    <br>I remember hagure yuushayuusha when I look at the mc.</br>  The MC is based  <br>this. He's the reason I watch this</br>  <br>Any 1920x1080 onesÉ</br>  <br>What's your problem, are you just trolling or seriously have a sensitivity problem at the slightest disagreeable attitude? She is like virtually not overbearing at all. She caves easily under pressure that gets her receding into a vulnerable little girl. She quickly gets back up because she wants to prove her worth and her abilities. The whole thing is done with cute tone.</br>  This sounds incredibly lewd.  <br>Isn't 1080 an upscale? Only HS has 1080 releases and I think their subs can't be turned off.</br>  This shit is fun. Why do people dislike this again? <br><br>As a haremfag I'm loving this.</br></br>  Did the funi rip fuck up for anyone else at 11.42?<br>It cuts out in the middle of unsubbed dialogue, then skips to the ad break.<br>Checked the raw and it has about 30 seconds of additional video, which the funi rip fucked up.<br><br><br>Probably the OST and setting. It's unexpectedly comfy as fuck, for an apocalyptic [insert mysterious monsters that attack humanity here] theme.<br><br><br><br>My niggas.<br><br><br>Me too anon, me too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they force themselves to watch something they don't like to complain needlesly</br>  <br><br><br>What was the anime like? Worth watching, just to get a feel for the characters, before starting the LN from volume 1?<br>Or was it irredeemable garbage that should be avoided?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eh, a small following is probably best for this show. It's cool if there's only several of us. AT least we'll have each other. I'll be here every week making stitches too.<br><br>Anyways, I'm enjoying this show quite a lot myself. It adequate in satisfying my fix for (battle) harem. The MC is honestly good, even possibly refreshing for being nonchalant, understanding, competent, confident, and a pretty smooth talker. When you add in the fact he is OP'd/special, all that might make him sound like a gary stu, but his attitude and depiction in the story mostly avoid that by not putting him on a pedestal. <br><br>The girls aren't that bad at all too. They are generic, very much so, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Tedious perhaps for some, but not inherently bad. I can see them growing on me and can foresee the three of them overcoming their drawbacks and flaws, so they have room to grow. They have poor team work now, but that surely will change from the ragtag team they are now, so it'll be cool to witness them kick ass together via real teamwork.<br><br>The setting is something I really like, which I do chalk it up to something that came out of CSR x AT. The scenery and setting backgrounds that reflects CSR x AT are visually pleasing and quite stunning, so that only makes it better for me. Oh yeah, comfy soundtrack is nice too in making the show relaxing and entertaining.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did the funi rip fuck up for anyone else at 11.42? <br>They did<br>Goddamit, first Overlord, then Logos and now this. Fucking funishit</br></br></br>  The CG is horrible, but the MC's cool and it has the same char designer as Full Metal Panic. Music's nice too.    Because why not.  <br>CSR's anime is okay. The LN is far better, but the anime is helpful in giving some characters a voice and tone that you can feel and sort out. Felli's seiyuu does a great job and there is delicious Felli to be seen in the anime, so it's worth checking out anyways.</br>  Done for today. I think.  <br>This is on par with Mahou Sensou.</br>  <br>Let's not go crazy, anon. MS is a trainwreck. This show has yet to become a trainwreck.</br>  No   A chill and visually pleasing Kuusen Madoushi <br>Wow. Ar tonelicofriends are miracle workers. I hope every thread will be like this. I would start looking forward to the weekly threads instead of avoiding them beyond a quick glance every so often. <br><br>Anywaya, I enjoyed episode two. It was much better than the first episode. The MC is mostly carrying the show, but the girls are cute and I like the intwresting premise of badass MC becoming an instructor for a dysfunctional team.<br><br>Also, thanks stitch anon for contributing.</br></br></br></br></br>  I like Rico the best but that's because I haven't seen many female narcissistic characters before. It's typically always a guy that fills that role if it's present. Rest of the show is pretty ho hum just doing the routines.  <br>You're drunk anon, go to sleep.</br>  <br> This is on par with Mahou Sensou. <br>No. So far it's okay. Could turn into shit though, so here's to hoping.</br></br>  Misora a shit. <br><br>A SHIT.</br></br>  <br> The story is set in a world where humanity, driven off the land by the threat of magical armored insects, now live in aerial floating cities. Thus wizards—aerial combat mages who fight the insects with magical powers—came into being. <br><br>Kanata Age is a young man who lives on the floating wizard academy city of "Misutogan." He was once celebrated as the "Black Master Swordsman," the elite ace of the S128 special team; however, he is now despised as the "traitor of the special team." One day, he is assigned as the instructor of E601, a team that has suffered ten consecutive defeats. E601 has three girls—Misora Whitale, Lecty Eisenach, and Rico Flamel—with one or two peculiar quirks.<br><br>This is literately Chrome Shelled Regios with more harem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> with more harem <br>Fon Fon had a huge harem man, he just ignored them all for the worst girl until he woke the fuck up and started romancing Felli</br></br>  <br>But this guy doesn't even have a harem.</br>  <br>  first few minutes of the episode <br>  MC tells her to shut up <br><br>This show is definitely one I'm sticking eith.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still. So is it better that CSR? Is it vastly different when you actually get into it? Are the characters authentic and not just cutouts?<br><br>Is this shit worth watching, Anon?</br></br></br>  <br>That was priceless</br>  <br>No idea not a LNfag for this series, just pointing out that Fonfon had 6 or so girls after his dick.</br>   Opening the door to a girl's changeroom <br>MC is clearly to be blamed for that</br>   Funi fucking around half-way through the episode   <br> no sub group picked it up </br>  You people really watch this pile of shit? I watched the first 12 minutes and had to drop it because of the amount of stupid cliches and the abysmal quality of it all.  <br>i wonder why</br>  <br>I watch it for the based MC.<br>Yeah, the first 12 minutes is painful to watch.</br></br>  <br>I don't blame them. Although fansubbing is dying anyways.</br>  <br>I'm watching it for the stupid cliches and terrible quality.</br>  <br>All it skipped was him saying "let's play tag" right?</br>  <br>What happened to childhood friend? She didn't get the Fon-Fon Dite?</br>  <br>She kind of turned him down to become queen.<br><br>To be fair he was being a massive shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't know, but  claims it to be around 30 seconds.</br>  Misora a shit  The budget for this show is appalling. They can't even afford to animate talking heads for too long.  <br>At least i like the ED. I just hope this also get an Unlimited fafnir tier attention where someone likes it that he started translating the LN.</br>  <br>UF anime was terrible and sleep inducing. Even in the middle of the day. Also fuck TBS and their latecast policy. It killed any possible discussion during winter</br>  Why would anyone watch this when we see the MC die in the first minutes of the first episode?  <br> Die <br>Lol, no. Second episodes says he runs away like a bitch. And episode 1 say's they just lose memory.</br></br>  <br> Like a bitch <br>Eh, at least he is alive. He was strong as fuck, much stronger than the team with him there. Was he supposed to die? What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Wizards remember the people that die but the normal people don't. <br><br>Also based on the injury talk and MC using the board thing I bet he can't fly anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>It will be revealed soon unless you like reading books.</br>  <br>I already read the Overlord and Rokka no Yuusha's ln this season. I've had enough of reading shitty prose.</br>  <br> OF YOU </br>  <br>my bad, i was not actually referring the attention UF got just because it was good but rather a special case of attention where people got interested in novels more than the anime since it was translated in fast speed.</br>   refined movements   <br>He was obviously talking about her fighting before her shyness kicked in.</br>  <br>Pretty sure you can watch everything, anon.</br>  <br>It hurts watching. My body just rejects this show, but I have to keep watching. <br><br>Why are two of the three main girls gutter shit? And the other one is decent, if not for being the scared/shy to the max. <br>Why is the mc walking into the changing room? At least use an excuse for that like they have been in there for over an hour, so it doesn't seem like a cringe scene #3000<br>Why are all the conversation so cringe with the mc and the main girls? Before that, why are the main girls conversation cringe? They should've used the A-team members instead if they would be better than the main characters, and even they're mediocre. <br>And holy shit if there's already this much of an issue with the budget I really don't want to see how the rest will turn up. <br><br>Please tell me that the source material is better, or at least gets better after a while.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is so bully-able.</br>    <br>I feel like you wouldn't even get a chance to bully her before she starts apologizing. It's kind of annoying, I hope she gets better.</br>  Misora is pure shit. The other two girls at least have serviceable skill/technique but Misora just acts like a retard. What good is her speed/stamina if she has absolutely no real combat training from the looks of it? Uses her weapon like it's the first time she's ever held it and can't even see through the most simplest of combat maneuvers. Cut your losses and boot that dumb bitch out.  <br>useless moe</br>  <br> Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan <br> Ar tonelico. <br>Nigger don't you dare say such a thing.</br></br></br>  <br>From what I can tell all that was cut was a small tease by MC, "let's play tag", and their reactions. Nothing too serious, but still not excusable.</br>  Animation is complete dogshit and its mostly tripe, but its still more watchable than some of the other shit this season.  <br>Posting best girl</br>  <br>Fucking 3d models just like KC</br>  <br>The MC's coat?</br>  <br>Whoops, posted wrong image</br>  <br>Misora is garbage.</br>  <br> expecting good animation from diomedea <br>personally i have zero expectations when diomedea handles a show since UF and WB happened.</br></br>  <br>Agreed.Misora is the cutest girl as of yet.</br>  <br>You're joking right? I thought it was agreed upon that Diomedia was the best studio for shitty battle harems.</br>   There are people who don't think Misora is best girl   <br>I know. Some people aren't subhumans.</br>  I want to _______ Red  <br>take responsibility for the outcome of coming inside</br>  <br>eviscerate</br>  <br>mindbreak</br>  <br><br>Hot-headed baka moe is moe. It is a shame anti-tsunfags still are trying hard to hate her by desperate means.</br></br>  <br>He was talking about the animation, and he's right. Making those 4 other shows definitely drained them.<br><br>At least WB made fun of its own QUALITY but you can't pull that shit twice in a row.</br></br></br>  <br>She's like not even violent, right? THK is one inconsistent faggot for sperging for no good reason.</br>  <br> THK <br>dank</br></br>  <br><br>Ar Tonelico need to have a fucking anime adaption and not just a shity OVA. Those songs are sex</br></br>  <br>danké</br>  <br>i was talking about animation and not about if it's the best studio for haremshit since it doesn't count as an achievement considering only few studios do haremshit this year while diomedea did 3 haremshit this year(besides the studio handling Absolute duo has tolerable animation than diomedea which made webm related)</br>  <br><br/></br>  Real best girl passing by.  <br>That midriff, muh dick.</br>  <br>I'll keep watching it to see this apathetic MC doing something, it could be fun.</br>  <br><br>Ignore obvious shitposts and bait, guys. This thread has been mostly nice and comfy for half a day, so it's counterproductive for detractors to be forceful out of nowhere.</br></br>  <br>So this is going to be repeat of the shit he was doing with Strike the Blood threads?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Who is THK?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Retards think only one person hates tsundere and they call THK anyone who hates them.</br>  Misora is best. She is cute and a ball of fun energy. I like that she does have some skills and talent behind her boasting, but is in needed of refinement and proper training to make her a good all-rounder.  <br>Misora a shit.</br>  <br>Worse. He tried for a repeat of Blade Dance in the first week. We had a couple of threads be wasn't around for and the difference is huge (no chain spams, especially the absence of constantly agreeing posts over every little shitposts).<br><br><br>You must be pretty new here. Well, don't let THK himself trick you. Search the archive for "THK" to see for yourself. THK banned and THK exposed will show you serious autism.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool story bro.</br>  <br>I like her too. It's usually the feisty ones that tend to make my pants tight.</br>  <br><br>I just find her whole 'TRAITOR HENTAI' thing really fucking annoying. Her voice doesn't help either. She's just irritating.</br></br>  <br>She's one of those girls who work best in small doses.</br>  <br>You have horrible taste.</br>  Pic related is better  <br> TRAITOR HENTAI <br>I don't care for that. It's a gag in the series that they all do, so it's like whatever.<br> voice doesn't help either. <br>But her voice is ear sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit dat shit taste.</br>    <br>So why is he a traitor, what really happened?</br>  <br>Go find something else to do, THK. You're beyond stale now ever since you entered the thread to reply to every single post for Misora in the form of shitpost.</br>   Lecty has zero fans itt <br>Lecty confirmed worst girl.</br>  <br> silence counts as no argument <br>popularity begets shitposting</br></br>  <br>That wasn't me by the way.

She's obnoxious.</br></br>  <br> THK <br>dank</br></br>  <br> That wasn't me by the way. <br>I can tell. THK wouldn't be as reserved as you.<br> obnoxious <br>Curious. How and compared what other similar tsundere?</br></br></br></br>  <br> anyone disagreeing their favorite tsundere <br> uses THK as the first excuse to shit on those who dont like their tsunderes. <br>even if THK actually exist, im thinking anons uses THK as a scapegoat to justify that their tsundere character is the best even though some of them are shit in some degrees.</br></br></br>  When is Felli going to show up?  <br>You're right, that's why the THK spouting retards get BTFO in threads like this<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127739<wbr>327</wbr></br></br>  <br>Lecty's shyness is really annoying.</br>  <br>How can it be.

THK is completely different from those who merely dislike or even hate tsundere. This has been proven many times by tracing back his patterned shitposts and insane autism. See  and then look at &gt;&gt; 128128947 <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127536238 . Even when he gets called out, he still does it anyways. Many knows about THK by now after 3 years of him shitting up /a/. Aside from his apologists and cheap clones, anyone sane enough would avoid defending or copying a serious shitposter like him. <br><br>If THK wasn't autistic as he is and only voiced his opinions like a normal poster, hardly anyone would care about him since he'll just get lost in the sea of posts. But no, his goal is to undermine the entirety of tsundere and spread falsified hate, and that is the real problem with him.</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>You can take off that tinfoil hat and stop being ridiculous anytime.</br>  <br>You can't argue against those links and reasoning.

That's not fun for battle anime.</br>  <br>It just started man</br>  <br>If this episode is any indication, I hope you enjoy CGI battles when/if they actually happen.</br>  <br>RIco's sister &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty &gt; Misora &gt; Chloe &gt; Devil Beetle &gt; Yuri</br>  <br>Chloe &gt; Yuri &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty &gt; shit &gt; Misora</br>  <br>Not exactly slow, but more relaxing and building up for bug invasion. As I recall, LNfag said the series mostly focuses on school tournaments. So a large part of the story will spend time developing the team so they can work together and raise their rank. The MC normally doesn't fight the bugs when they become a problem (for good reason), so he sends the trio and Chloe to deal with the bugs under his direction. It's that sort of thing.</br>  <br> not getting accustomed to the pacing for battle harem novels. <br>based on experience, most of novels where 3 episodes consist of 1 volume it is quite rare to see 2 episodes of fighting and a single episode of SOL and other stuff.</br></br>  <br> Misora &gt; Yuri &gt; Chloe &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty <br>I am okay with this.</br></br>  Is this better or worse than Seiken Tsukai no World Break? In terms of entertainment value, of course, it's not like there's any literary value in battle harems.  <br> Chloe &gt; Yuri &gt; Rico &gt; Lecty &gt; shit &gt; Misora <br>I'm okay with this.</br></br>  <br>It's too early to tell.</br>  <br>The main girls are almost the same, but as shitty as Misora is, at least she isn't as horrible as that steaming pile of shit named Claire.</br>  <br> Mocking me because I agree with taste you are mad at <br>That's pretty sad.</br></br>  <br> being mad because more than one person hates the shitty tsundere <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Go away THK</br>  <br> https://archive.moe/a/thread//#q12<wbr>7804904</wbr> <br>Go to bed, THK.</br></br>  <br> In terms of entertainment value <br>It's pretty hard to beat WB at that, and this isn't even close.</br></br>  <br><br>Nice phone m8</br></br>  <br>No, but you clearly did that out of mockery for reactions. You got your reaction, but it's still sad you have to samefag like that.</br>  Misora is really cute  <br> it's samefag because it angers me <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br> Hates Claire <br> Hates even Misora <br>Now this is shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>No, THK. But there's no point trying to convince you.</br>  <br> phone <br>You of all people should know that better than anyone.</br></br>  <br>The anime is going to be horrible though, you know they're cramming in 9 volumes into 2 cour.</br>  <br> he LIKES Claire </br>  <br>That was such an idiotic decision.</br>  <br>You never have once been able to argue why she is so bad for you whenever thoughtful posts arguing why she is cute and developed were thrown at you. Don't pretend otherwise.</br>  <br> You <br>Who?<br>Even novelfags dislike Claire.</br></br></br>  <br> Merely pretending <br>That again, huh.<br><br> dislike <br>Yeah, that's why she's in the top 3 in the poll for LNfags, right? Fuck off already.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a pretty big gap between the first two and her though.</br>  <br> he thinks I'm talking about Japan <br><br>Weren't you here for the early threads about the series? Barely anyone supported Claire at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Does not change my point. Est and Restia are simply more popular, Est especially by a huge margin compared to everyone else.<br><br><br>I was there for the whole season and before. Before the anime aired and months the season began, we had occasional STnBD threads. Those pre-air threads we had were decent and had nil shitposting. Waifu ranking happened sometimes and they hardly caused terrible waifu wars. Claire had her fair share of detractor, many whom didn't hate the way you do, but also a few novelfags who likes her most or a lot (I being one of them). <br><br>For those who read the LN and didn't like Claire at the start, they at least acknowledge that she gets better and develops, so the atmosphere is completely different from the hate you keep forcing when the anime started.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> didn't hate the way you do <br> the hate you keep <br><br>Who are you even talking to? Not everyone is out to get you.</br></br></br></br>  I don't know why this made me laugh but it did.  I like Claire and Misora. Adorable red hair tsundere with cheeky personalities and small tits are my fetish.<br><br>Haters are gonna hate etc.</br></br>  <br> Implying you aren't  pretending. </br>  <br>Nope.</br>   Even if THK were to die tomorrow his name will be brought up forever in any series that features a red haired Tsundere <br>He has become immortal</br>  <br>That's how retarded THKfags are.</br>  <br> Kirino <br> Claire <br> Misora </br></br></br>  <br> Gets thrown off MC's trail by a simple maneuver <br> Is like a lost animal trying to hunt down her prey she wants to wack <br> Is still at it dozens of minutes in grumpy fashion <br>Misora is cute, like really cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unlikely. If THK were to truly drop dead tomorrow, /a/ would become a much better place and nearly every threads he previous stalked to shitpost in would have a lot less shitty waifu wars and almost no a shit. A SHIT spams. People wouldn't call out THK when THK no longer posts.</br>  So I just watched the first two episodes.<br><br>I tend to watch all harems in a season if I've seen previous seasons or if it's the first season.<br><br>The first episode was fucking horrible, like even worse than Isuca.<br><br>Episode two however was pretty great and besides the chuuni bitch it was very enjoyable.<br><br>Ep3 looks great as well, I wish they could be more consistent with Misora's breasts size though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know that's all bullshit. People will still retardely keep calling anyone who dislikes tsundere THK.</br>  <br> Kirino <br> Claire <br> Misora <br>Good taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying THK's death wont be used by minority of tsunderefags to shit on those who disagree their favorites <br>i'm not saying all of tsunderefags but what i am saying is quite possible since every fanbase has their own shitposter here on /a/</br></br>  <br>It looks like another SAO</br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  <br><br>There are bad seeds in virtually every fanbase. It could be idiots, reverse trolls, or those that wants to abuse it as a meme for their own means. But bad seeds typically are a minority. The majority and those who only would call THK out when it's a post he would undoubtedly make wouldn't if THK is no longer posting.</br></br>  <br><br>I was about to post something similar. The first episode was pretty bad, but second episode was better. The MC is pretty decent, too, which is probably the main thing that's keeping me watching this. Heroine-wise I don't really have a favorite, though I guess if I were to choose it'd be Rico because she's the funniest and her negative traits are a bit more tolerable than the two others'.<br><br>There's one thing I don't get yet: Everyone calling Kanata a "traitor." They say it's because he "skips" on missions, but from the hints in the second episode (using a floating device instead of a flight spell, Chloe saying that he's on "sick leave," not attacking the heroines during training) it seems he's lost most of his powers or something. I'm guessing he lost them because of that giant Devil Beetle in the prologue. If this is the case, how is he a "traitor" for holding off and nearly dying to hundreds of Beetles to save his team and not being able to fight due to his injuries? Is it explained further in the novel?</br></br></br></br>  How far is too far?  <br>He is not telling the truth that he is dying.</br>  <br><br><br>As someone who points out LRD and THK, I can say that it takes certain requirements for me do that. Random and generic tsun/loli haters usually don't cut it.</br></br></br>  <br>If you can stomach ar tonelico you can stomach all these bitches. This resemble ar tonelico more than you think.</br>  <br>I actually laughed out loud reading his character bio.<br>That's some Kirito level edge.</br></br>  <br>The OP said Ar Tonelico. There is nothing too far for Ar Tonelico standard though.</br>  <br>Relevant spoilers for you.<br><br> The MC used to be a super genius in both tactic, magic, and battle skill. During his plunge down planet earth The MC ran into a boss and was infected with The Dark Force. This Dark Force continuously feed on his total possible MP, and the MC keeps it in check with his remaining MP.<br><br>After he returned, he quits (take holiday) all patrol, fighting, and inner-school activities as he has no power remain. He also doesn't want others know he is infected with The Dark Force. Others thought he became a coward from his near death experience and despite him.<br><br>You won't see him fight much as he doesn't have much power remaining. Yes he can use the Dark Force and go berserk, but it speeds up its rate of power devour and he would like to stay as a human for as long as he can. He usually uses it to only power 1 blow. Mostly it's his students and his childhood friend that fights the bug under his direction.<br><br>So the MC knows he is going to die soon, but he wants to leave something for humanity before he dies (or turn into bugs). So he agrees to teach these 3 girls all of his battle skills. Basically a 'took an arrow in the knee and now I stay behind and teach youngsters the way of battle' sort of thing.<br><br><br>You probably are not surprise to learn that the boss removed The Dark Force from his body in volume 5/6. So now he can use his original magical power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br> There is a girl in this show right now that is kinda similar to Finnel <br>And I like it.</br></br>  <br>This tbh</br>  <br>From spoilers I read  his powers got really fucked with by that fight with the beatle but it's not something he can really reveal since his power changed. Basically it became some kind of weird mix of his original power and the power the beatles use. At the same time it's possibly stronger but he went from being able to basically use his power whenever to having a strict limit on how long he can use it now, why he has to use the board for flight. He keeps his condition a secret from pretty much everyone though.<br><br>Basically he's considered a traitor because he was the top ace and hero and now he refuses to fight or participate in anything. His goal is to train/find a replacement ace. </br></br> </br>  <br>You had me, anon.<br>This would actually be quite interesting, but that final spoiler made me lose that interest immediately, what a cop out if true.</br></br>  <br>Go watch the OP, and pay attention to when he goes full edge master.<br><br>Berserks are fun!</br></br></br>  <br>Who? It can't be Yuri...so Misora?</br>  <br>Can it reach that volume to let's see the true power of the MC or it will just focus on Ar Tonelico type of game that makes the girls can show their true power and skill.</br>  <br><br><br><br> Interesting. I guess the reason he doesn't at least inform his friends of what's happening to him is because he doesn't want them to worry about him? Too bad it seems Yuri hates him, though. <br><br>That last spoiler, though. Weird of them to go that route. Is the story nearing its end or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Misora? <br> Yes. </br></br>  <br>Are you want to die of sickness for killing a jacko type of villain more of this shit is just an insect.</br>  THK please save us  <br><br>Yeah, that last spoiler irks me. The series would be quite the gem if it took the route of MC dying in the end and his students taking up his mantle after instilling them of his skills and teaching sort of end. Epilogue flashforward years into the future to see a glimpse of what became of his students and the outcome of the war (if there is any).</br></br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Misora a shit.<br><br>A SHIT<br><br>S<br>H<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would he keep secret that he got infected and seek help instead?</br>  <br><br>Finnel is second best AT3. Misora is current best KMKnK.</br></br>  <br>Misora took a dump while MC watches?</br>  <br>Misora a shit though.</br>  <br><br>He doesn't exist.</br></br>  I want to _______ THK  <br>   You probably are not surprise to learn that the boss removed The Dark Force <br>Why?

While it has a neat setting, I kind of find the characters flat and the dialogue atrocious. Every single fucking villain monologues their entire fucking plan or how their power works near constantly. I get that with such an intricate setting immersed in old mythology you need to explain some shit, but it's handled so horribly.<br><br>Though it was interesting enough for me to read through all five translated volumes at least.<br><br><br>Worm has its ups and its downs, but it has some of the best use of superpowers I've ever seen in fiction. And the climax of the story is one of the few things I would describe with the word epic despite that word's extreme overuse.<br><br>It is incredibly long so it takes quite a while to get to that payoff though. Also due to being a superhero series, there are a lot of fucking characters. And those are hard to remember and keep track of in such an extremely long story, but surprisingly it manages it well though I guess that's one of the reasons it's so damn long. It's also not shy about killing characters off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The important question is whether he hooks up with the loli or not.<br>Oda Nobuna is probably the worst in that aspect (pervert protag, yet disgusted by lolis), but Black Bullet has the old hag childhood friend winning too.</br></br>  Since an anime is basically confirmed at this point, might as well read up to bitch about secondaries in the threads<br>:^)</br>  <br>Does he have his Lolislayer title yet?

I've started to read Elvenblood. It's up on the same site of Anti Magic. Overall, it has very high edge content and the story seems pretty predictable right now.

It's fun, but I can't help but think the author totally fucked up after revealing MC can basically bloodbend.

One group translated 4 chapters, another group translated from there until like chapter 12, then someone else picked it up from there until 18.

ITT, no spoonfeeding.  <br>In the OP pic it's the rei clone.</br>  <br>But why would you want to eat a spoon in the first place?</br>  yep anyone can experience the joy of watching your love fucking someone else  <br>Yes? That's conventionally what most NTR is. And you can stop making these repeat NTR threads; people had already hated it enough so there's no need to play the agent provocateur.</br>  <br>please i want my gay ntr</br>  <br> no use getting pregnant and having no provider. <br>And that's where the role of the beta provider comes in.</br></br>  <br>that's a boy?</br>  <br>Yep, 100% a boy.</br>  ITT: Muh Fetish, NTR Sucks, Vanilla Fags Butt hurt... ect  <br>You're that same person who posts this same response in this thread every time aren't you</br>  <br>Where is he from god dammit.</br>  Yes, but it's not the same thing. Both women and men get jealous, but for different reasons. For a woman the worst is seeing her man having romantic feelings for another woman, while for man the worst is seeing her woman being fucked by another man. There're women who wouldn't care that much if they found out his partner hired hooker or had a one night stand, but she'll be destroyed if he's  holding hands  with another woman.  <br>It still depends on the woman but I accept this as correct answer.</br>  <br><br>Boku No Adam</br></br>  <br>Any good NTR doujins?</br>  <br>Source? Google, Saucenao, and Tineye aren't giving me anything.</br>  <br>No, I don't post in shitty r9k threads very often but I'm a bit inebriated right now.</br>  <br> he doesn't know tomo-chan </br>  <br>Obviously these differences are on average, just like every other variable concerning human behavior.</br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br><br>buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br> Have Mikan, Yui, Haruna, and soon this preordered. <br><br>Toloveru has a special place in my heart.</br></br></br>  <br>Well shit I hope I get mine soon.</br>  <br> too skinny <br> flat colors <br> missing semen chunks <br><br>Almost perfect</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Do you have another ones on PO?, I have room for two more scales this year(customs limitations) that's why I'm looking for suggestions.</br>   [HorribleSubs] Kyoukai no Rinne - 15 [720p].mkv   Mamiya Sakura. Take off your clothes.      <br>I hope they animate Jumonji vs Tennis Racket.</br>  <br>Is that coming up soon?</br>  Hey so apparently there's an alternate ending to the third Vanquished Queens OVA where Reina gets mind broken instead. No one ever subbed it because apparently fan-subbers got too triggered. But I can't even find the raws anywhere. All the links lead to a single now dead dailymotion link.<br><br>Does it still exist somewhere? Every place I've looked has turned up nil.</br></br>  Leaks soon, lets wait together.<br>Soon the fate of the series will be known. <br>Also happy birthday to Hayarin (28) for yesterday.</br></br>  <br>Because there's not much known about her aside from her slight tsukkomi-yaku personality and her love for Sawaya (and even the latter is something rather speculative), so people can project a lot of interesting things on her. <br><br>I think it makes her pretty fun.</br></br></br>  <br>She's the only cute Sergeant.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Hao and Sumire are sexy. Chikako is cute as fuck and I want to unwrap her under a christmas tree.</br></br></br>  don't die  <br>But Aislinn is cute as well!</br></blockquote>]
