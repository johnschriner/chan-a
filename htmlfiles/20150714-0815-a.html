[ Why are normalfags always best girl?  Because they are down to earth and more humanized than run of the mill stereotypes.  Normal girls need love too<br><br>Ti-chan was best girl</br></br>  <br><br><br>I'd let her scream in my face if ya know what I mean ;)</br></br></br>  <br>Eu was the best you nigger</br>  <br>Eused goods a shit.</br>  Which K-ON is the lewdest?  <br>You know it's true~</br>  <br> actually having a neckbeard  <br>wtf mang?</br></br>  <br>Not all of us have so little self respect that we don't take care of ourselves.</br>  <br>If you would sexualise Anko you are clearly not fit for society let alone to be in a relationship with these angels</br>  <br>Sawa a best, would give a kidney to marry her</br>  Get in here and discuss why Hana is  the most entertaining girl, in my honest opinion. <br><br>Other boys and girls are welcome too.</br></br>  <br>No.<br>Good person=good person<br>Chiyo, given what we've seen so far at least is a good person.

Who killed the eggs?   people sit in the back of every room next to a window, staring outside <br> "I want to know how it feels to be cummed inside" is the motto  <br> a faint lingering smell of cum is present in the entire house <br> that one guy that doesn't use headphones and has their speakers on max, but no one does anything about it because everyone's a faggot <br> there are several rooms where people stand naked, jerking eachother off in a circle. The biggest room in the house always talks about how great the fate vn was and hyping heaven's feel; secondaries are not welcome. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I  could try sucking your dick </br>  ...and here is our living room  SOMEONE GET THE PHONE  Who is best gun?  <br>Thompson sensei.</br>  <br>Viz-chan</br>  Galil  Still waiting for Ichiyon puns.  <br> Jewish catgirl <br>YES PLS</br></br>  Ranma/Takahashi thread!

It had dimensions that got cut out of the adaptation.<br><br>With that out of the way, let the customary waifu wars commence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never happend, he made it all up. why are you trusting a conmans word? Especially after all other things he done?<br><br>If someone breaks up another persons family and at the same time steals form middleschoolars, how low of IQ do you have to be that that person would either do that because he was egoistical and psychopathic and then lie about the reason he did it? (even if he did truly did it for the reason that was stated, its still egoistical instead of doing what most non egoistical people would do, not interfere and let them go back toghether again) its only by nision being a dumbass writer that every police is incompetent in the show, especially for laws that are against human trafficking which most cults do, including other stuff cults do.<br><br>Oh and then stealing money from her was another?<br>Again, the only true part of <br>was that he was a looser.

I believe in you! Monogatari is basically the guidebook to dating a Hanekawa.<br>Model after Koyomi.<br>Set Shinobu to Hanekawa Mode.<br>XXX<br>Profit!<br><br>Seriously man. I wanted an Asuka so I modeled after Kaji. Worked like a fucking charm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Way to undo Vegeta's character development.  <br><br>Because  the movies were not canon .</br></br>  Maybe Beerus and Vegeta can vpnd over their favorite past-time of blowing up planets.<br><br>Oh wait, that'll never get brought up again.</br></br>  <br><br>People who wanted this series to continue instead of killing it while it was still good (mid cell saga).</br></br>  <br>Beerus has the word destruction on his job title. It's his role to blow shit up. Unlike Vegeta, he was just evil<br><br><br>Boo saga was better than Cell</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This but MUH PRIDE will always get in the way of that sort of training.<br><br>Pretty much like how Frieza never trained a single day of his life and when he did he could surpass every shitty supersayan transformation in 4 months.<br><br>Damn, everybody in the DB universe is so fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who is Charlotte?  <br>I think I came.</br>  <br><br>Boy she looked so hot and so amazing (mostly because she'd be the only good female, bar imouto) yet she's basically a carcass for her dead sister, who is most likely shit in her own way.
