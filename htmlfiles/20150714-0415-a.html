[  Stupei    INEVERFELTLIKE   So what's with the fucking BD release dates? Why did 2 take so fucking long?  <br> DA DA DA DA OVER ME </br>  Jubei a shit  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Ju<wbr>lmXSbWF0</wbr>  [ ]  Sup, Yuka-tan?  Stupei and Yucatan are two of my favorite video game characters of all time.  Part 3 BD when?  <br>Meh I don't really hate him. His jealousy for MC is understandable.</br>  <br> ACE DEFECTIVE </br>  <br>They should fuck, furiously, hatesexily.</br>  <br><br><br>I love this soundtrack so fucking much.</br></br></br>  <br>SOME DANCE<br>FOR THE PUSSY IN THE TRAIN, <br>LETS PORN, ONLY IF YOU BUY IT<br>MOVE YOUR BODY, MOVE THAT BODY BITCH<br>SO MAKE SURE YOU DONT HUMP NOBODY<br>I SAID HEY HEY HEY<br>YOU FILLIN UP THAT BODY WITH A BURNED LASAGNA YEAH!! <br>YOU'RE GONNA FALL FOR THAT PIG, <br>THERE'S SHIT ON SWING, <br>COME ON GIRL LEMME ROCK YOUR WORLD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SO DANCE<br>WANT A PUSSY IN MY PANTS <br>THERE'S PORN, MOVIN IN YOUR BODY<br>MOVE YOUR BODY MOVE THAT BODY<br>RICHARD MAKE SURE YOU DONT HUMP NOBODY <br>I SAID HEY HEY HEY <br>YOU DO THE PARTY WITH SOME BURNT LASAGNA YEA<br>YOU SONT OPEN THAT BIG<br>ATE SHIT LAST WEEK! <br>CMON GURL LET ME ROCK YOUR WORLD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more like ace defective</br>  <br>Lil Ugly Mane is that you?</br>  FEELING ALL PRESSURED BY THE PEERS AND THE MEDIA<br><br><br>They might as well in the movies after they cut out his character arc with Chidori.</br></br></br>  <br><br>FUCKING BULLIES GET THE FUCK OFF OF MY BOARD</br></br>      <br>I am curious to see how they're going to handle things now that they skipped Chidori's capture.</br>  WE ARE LIVING OUR LIVES <br>AROUND WITH SO MUCH INFORMATION</br>  Still annoyed they're skipping the SLs due to it being a movie with less time.<br>Sun, Tower and Hierophant are amazing.<br>Devil's fun too.</br></br>   You will never get a dual audio Persona game   <br>I spent so much time on this game, and this soundtrack is awesome and probably why I felt so comfortable with everything.</br>  <br>Sup dude.</br>  <br><br>At least P4's dub had Laura Bailey.<br><br>And even she's been replaced by, of all things, a Burch</br></br></br></br>  <br> Still annoyed they're skipping the SLs due to it being a movie with less time. <br>The only 'social link' worth giving a shit about in P3 or P4 is Elizabeth's requests, which isn't even a social link.<br><br>Also you're completely retarded for thinking they should shorten important story elements for slice of life bullshit. You should probably kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Yukari is all about the MC D</br>  <br>She captures him in the third movie. Yukari punches Mitsuru instead of the slap, Everyone gets executed except for Makoto this time, He spends most of his screen time with Aigis and Ryouji with Aigis acting like she's being cucked and the ultimate personas for Ken,Yukari,Mitsuru and Aigis were cut. Only Junpei gets his and it was on screen for a few seconds before he passed out without making an attack.</br>  <br> You will never hear Fuuka's original English voice actress again. </br>  <br>I never said they should shorten the events.<br>I said I'm annoyed that because it's a movie and not a series they have to cut the SoL, I'm not that retarded to suggest they cut the story when they've already made quite a number of shortcuts here and there.</br></br>  <br> he passed out without making an attack. <br>That's a shame, because it was awesome seeing him Agidyne a guy who nulls fire.</br></br>  <br> best girl in Danganronpa 2 shares a VA with the worst thing to ever happen to Persona <br>Interesting.</br></br>  I'm playing Persona Q and enjoying it immensely, except for the fact Personas are reduced to being picture cut-ins. Like wow, what the fuck did they think this game was called? Posing and suddenly magic effects Q?  <br>I have searched far and wide and I still don't know what this is from</br>  <br><br> Her new one is in her fifties and is still cast as teenage girls <br><br>I give Wendee Lee a lot of credit. Not a lot of people can pull that off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the weirder thing is how they amped up Mitsuru's emoness, she started acting like she had apathy symdrom and when she finally snaps due to Yukari's constant pushing she doesn't say that there's no point to anything but that she wishes The chairman had shot her instead of her father.</br>  <br>I abhor her Haruhi voice, yet it's practically the only voice she uses nowadays.</br>  <br> I never said they should shorten the events. <br>That's the only way they would be able to fit 20 people's stories into four movies.<br>I'd like to remind you about how rushed and forced the social links were in Persona 4 animation especially.<br> I'm annoyed that because it's a movie and not a series they have to cut the SoL <br>Why? The individual people served no purpose except to reinforce the 'strength of bonds' thing, and that's not the main plot or theme. That's 'Death'. All they have to do is show the main character opening up to people and making friends and you have the same point with less useless garbage, meaning they don't have to make more shortcuts with the important story elements.<br><br>Realize what you're being annoyed with. If you had your way, you'd be annoyed that the story is being skipped over.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the ultimate personas for Ken,Yukari,Mitsuru and Aigis were cut <br>Wait, they skip all of those parts of the story? For what purpose?</br></br>  <br>I hated that part in the game, but only because I couldn't work on the Emperor S-Link while Mitsuru was being all emo.</br>  <br>whoa, Lelouch is voicing P5's protag?</br>  <br> Staying up 24 hours straight with a friend so you can finally master all social links to fuse Orpheus Telos <br> Get from the beginning of the game to the end, all social links maxed out. <br> Fuse a perfect Orpheus Telos to counter Elizabeth <br> Tried to beat Elizabeth 5 times, all ended at failures because I can't tell when she's under exactly 50% HP <br>Fuck this superboss, holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the director after the first movie was changed out for the one who did the Persona 4 golden anime from the second movie onwards. Thus huge amounts of the story that didn't directly involve Makoto were glossed over, changed to include Aigis or skipped entirely. From the third movie onwards Aigis joins the rest of SEES in being ignored for Ryouji and Makoto antics.</br>  <br>But Marie doesn't share the VA with Gundam Tanaka.</br>    <br>I had to use a calculator and subtract her HP by every hit I did</br>   KAZE NO KOE   <br>This frustrates me greatly, but can be saved if they include Elizabeth as the ultimate romance in the final movie.<br><br>I did that but somehow I was still wrong every time. It boggles my mind. Fuck math!</br></br></br>  I want to protect her.  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/5389/0f878b34<wbr>2a/<br>Here.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Elizabeth barely appears and all of her lines are lines from the game just like Igor, they aren't going to use her at all.</br>  <br> Glasses Fuuka <br>Oh yes.</br></br>  <br> can be saved if they include Elizabeth as the ultimate romance in the final movie <br>As much as I'd like this to happen, it doesn't seem likely given how often she's appeared so far.</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>http://a.uguu.se/wjxpqj.webm</br></br>    <br> bullying is so bad, hurr durr durr durr <br> constantly bullying Junpei <br>Why is Yukari the worst Persona girl?</br></br></br>  <br> it doesn't seem likely given how often she's appeared so far. <br>Probably because Miyuki Sawashiro has to pull double duty with Chidori and Elizabeth. It's kind of like how Yumi barely appeared in P4tA because Kanae Ito was already voicing Ai.</br></br>  <br>Neat, too bad it won't be dual audio and I don't know moon</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=G4H<wbr>owzUa9AQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>As you can see, Makoto really only cares about losing Ryoji the most and they likely will not bother to do the answer because in the movies Makoto has barely inter acted with SEES for things like Yukari's anger and jealously as well as Aigis's depression to make any sense on the big screen. Shame,too. I was looking forward to seeing Metis</br></br></br>  This thread needs more Adachi  <br>I do like the idea of them developing Ryoji more, because it was weird how the game expected us to care about him despite only having about 10 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>Grown ass man with a gun getting his ass whooped by an unarmed teenager in a one on one brawl? Bitch please.</br>  <br><br>Focusing on Ryoji seems like a weird choice. I don't even remember them having any Pharos segments in the movies after the initial contract.</br></br>  Light the Fire Up in the Night <br><br> P3 ver.  &gt;  P4 ver. </br></br>  <br>Always have Yukari and Junpei on the team in that game.</br>  <br> PERSONA 3 CAME OUT 9 YEARS AGO </br>  <br>fight me<br><br> Anzu being voiced by Sakisan and Rin VA <br>best girl already</br></br></br></br>  <br>The focus makes sense, because the whole "kill me, guys" dilemma is more impactful if Ryoji is an actual character rather than "that guy who causes Aigis to spaz out"</br>  <br> Unarmed teenager <br>You mean the ones with swords, guns, knives, claws, strong fucking legs, and a fan while equipped with physically enhancing 'personas' which are totally demons and legends?<br><br>Yeah. Adachi stood no chance at all the moment they found out it was his fault.</br></br></br></br>  Who Mitsuru here?<br><br>Best girl. Most perfect Persona girl.</br></br>  <br>I'm saying it doesn't make sense because they skipped the monthly Pharos visits and all of those conversations. It's going to seem even more like he comes out of nowhere.</br>  <br>When it comes at the cost of the team's development it doesn't. Especially with how they've handled Makoto in these movies. In 2 he was a selfish asshole who got Shinji killed just because he didn't want to be alone after the dark hour was eradicated. That's as disgusting as Yu willingly to let the world be destoryed just because he did not want to attack Izanami if it meant Marie's death as well. Neither persona main would act like that in character.</br>  So who else didn't understand that the  MC died at first? I thought he just went to sleep, like, normal sleep.   <br>Aigis only voiced by best girls. This is proof that the seiyu makes a girl best girl.</br>  <br>Me Mitsuru here</br>  <br> I only knew because I played Arena first. </br>  <br>By that token, Elizabeth/Chidori would be the best girl. Or Metis.<br><br>Also<br> Mari <br> Best girl <br>Everyone knows that  Kaworu  is the best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much me. I got P3FES when it was new, so nobody had played "The Answer" yet because they saw "auto-hard mode" and ran screaming from it like little babies.<br>So I finished "The Journey" and started "The Answer."<br>Got to save and just kinda sat there, mind blank while everything fell into place and a heavy depression settled over me.<br>It was pretty powerful the way they did it.<br>I recommend everyone play "The Answer".</br></br></br></br></br>  This Thread needs some Chie  <br>Nah.</br>  <br>Not that anon but Makoto actually having issues with removing the Dark Hour was actually a solid plot point. <br>Not for him but ironically for Strega. It gave them a bit of credence for their point the game never really expanded on. <br><br>The game preaches the Social Link aspects but ultimately it always comes down to the fighting. The Dark Hour is what codifies SEES in general.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that shit,watch it on Youtube. Yukari's bitchiness combined with Aigis's indeciveness made it a chore to get through. Especially because Junpei didn't punch Yukari's teeth in the moment she went over the line and called him a fucking coward for not wanting to undo Chidori's death. For gods sake she was willing to KILL Aigis to get that key. I know in the planning stages of P3 Yukari was the designated love interest but goddamn why'd they make her that evil?</br>  <br>Well, they had to give it to him since they apparently removed everyone else's struggles with it in the next movie. They already removed Junpei's whole story arc where he says he's able to feel like a hero because of what he can do in the Dark Hour.</br>  <br> Fuck that shit,watch it on Youtube. Yukari's bitchiness combined with Aigis's indeciveness made it a chore to get through. <br>You seem like the type to not like anime characters unless they're sucking the MC's dick. It was a rough time for all of them, understand that they're not thinking clearly.<br>The point of that was Yukari was crazy and the guy she loved died right in front of her on some robot's lap after saving the world. She's was in LOVE, bro. When that happens, you don't give a shit about anyone or anything except the person you wanna be with.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukari was a bitch for the entirety of P3. Why would that change?</br>  <br>The worst part about that is when they're showing the preview trailer, there's a brief second where she actually captures a good approximation of Bailey's voice. And then nothing.</br>  <br>Were you really expecting more from an Etrian Oddessy re-skin?</br>  <br>Yeah, this adaption has been pretty shit-tier for everything but fanservice. <br><br>It's just like they don't care.</br></br></br>   you will never be triple-teamed by the Velvet Room siblings   <br> fanservice. <br>That's pretty much what it is. It's not like they have any P3-related stuff to promote, unless Makoto is being brought back through the power of dance.</br></br>  Coincidentally I just finished Persona 3 yesterday and loved it. I didn't want to do the Maya/Toriumi gaming link because of "teh 1337 speak XD", but revealing that it was the teacher and then meeting her was fantastic.  <br>Elizabeth's questing to bring him back, but who knows if/when that's going to happen.</br>  <br> Brought back by dance <br> The Answer didn't even need to happen <br> They just boogie so hard Makoto comes back to life and pulls off a dance which makes humanity happy to be living at the same time as Makoto. </br></br></br>  <br> unlock Secret Character: Makoto <br> just a door swinging on its hinges as its dance moves </br></br>  <br>And they'll skip that scene in the movie.</br>  <br>Damn it, Ryoji. Don't bring true despair onto the world. <br><br>The Maya link is the best link.</br></br></br>  At least they did a good job with this scene.  <br> No tranny with a bulge <br>0/10.</br></br>  <br>That's the game's fault, it was changed in Portable to this </br>  <br>So it's basically a time travelled Chie getting hit on by Akihiko. <br><br>Makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>But portable was shit, why would anyone acknowledge it exists?</br>  <br> Focusing on Ryoji <br>Might as well make the MC to be FeMC to make makes more sense. Then again it's probably alluding the fact that MC doesn't really interact with SEES member when compared to FeMC</br></br>  <br> I played the original, had to have a friend tell me that they changed it when we watched the movie. I had to explain what happened in some cutscenes though, so it evened out. </br>  <br> Then again it's probably alluding the fact that MC doesn't really interact with SEES member when compared to FeMC <br>In the movies he didn't really interact with Pharos either.</br></br>  <br> Kanji, Daru, and Gilgamesh <br>What a range on that fucker. Jesus.</br></br>  I don't know.....  <br>Damn, Akihiko has a fine body.</br>     tfw you're born in the USA     I want to  date  Yukari so hard.  BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY  Who /JAMALKUN/ here?    <br>OOH YEAH,<br>Dada-dada, dada-dada,</br></br>  <br> Student council prez <br> Rie Tanaka <br>w-w-w-w-what</br></br></br>  <br>I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thought of that joke.</br>  Semen demon. Yukari is my favourite Persona.  Quick question<br><br>When will door kun find happiness?</br></br>  <br>When Elizabeth finds a way to save him. Then they'll live happily ever after together.</br>  <br>If he wasn't happy he wouldn't have become the Great Seal in the first place.</br>  <br>He already found happiness with his friends.</br>  Mitsuru is LOVE!<br>Mitsuru is LIFE!</br>  <br>Never ;_; He will be the ultimate door forever so that his friends and the p4 cast can live happy not suffering.<br><br><br>He will bear the suffering forever</br></br></br></br>  <br> He will bear the suffering forever <br>What about Elizabeth's quest?</br></br>  <br>Unless she bullshits someway to make literally everyone alive stop wishing for death, it's pointless.</br>  yosuke &gt; junpei  <br>The p5 protag will picklock the door and free the door-kun, while Igor will leave the velvet room in Minato care.</br>  <br> tfw door kun will never have fun with his friends again <br> tfw door kun will never growing up and having a family <br> tfw door kun will watch as his friends passed away <br> tfw even if he do get freed no one will be there except a toaster and a nympho </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she has to figure something out after wandering around in the collective unconscious for so long. Plus she got the Fool arcana, so there may be hope.</br>  Why are P3 girls so shit?  <br>This would be both amusing and FUCKING DO IT ATLUS. The World needs more Minato.</br>  <br> Akihiko <br> Hitting on anybody <br>He makes most of /a/ look smooth.</br></br></br>  <br>He tried his best. He got pushed into it by Junpei after just wanting to exercise at the beach.</br>    <br>This guy knows what's up.</br>  You'll never seduce Yukari at university. <br><br>Why even prosper?</br></br>  <br>I'd rather a nee-san Fuuka.</br>  <br>Because most of them have short hair which is disgusting.</br>  <br>Both versions are great.<br><br>I don't have Persona Q, but is the rest of the OST this  fun ?</br></br></br>  <br>I've seen some bad taste, but this is off the charts.</br>  <br>There really isn't a point.</br>  this thread need better MCs.  <br> he likes men </br>  <br>To be honest I thought hear voice isn't THAT bad.<br>Maybe the fifth worst.</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck was the worst then?</br>  <br>P3 SL's are pretty shit.</br>  So why did this not get a full tv anime like P4?  <br>Ryoji when he still was a boy and made my dreams with his nightly visits to nightmares.<br>He sounded like child molest tried to lure into his van.</br></br>  <br>Then why don't you post one, faggot?</br>  <br>U wot m8<br> Justice, Hermit, Hanged Man, Hierophant, Chariot <br> SUN, AEON <br>Yeah, you just have shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br> justice, chariot <br>Eeeeh.<br> no tower or devil </br></br></br>  <br>Okay then</br>  So step on up to the plate  <br>Who the fuck is this?</br>  <br>I didn't see anything good there.</br>  <br>I'll start.</br>  Post bona fide SMT sluts.<br><br>I'd still do her.</br></br>  <br>Lisa is top tier.</br>  <br>She's a qtpi but what the fuck is a persona 2.</br>  <br><br>Why did Stupei take off Aegis' arms?</br></br>  <br>Two games which are kind of janky mechanically but quite good from a story perspective.</br>  How were the movies?  I want to marry Yukiko  <br>fine, I guess</br>  <br>JUST FUCK MY EYES UP<br>Who thought it was a good idea to put chromatic abrasion on that? It genuinely hurts to look at.</br></br>  <br> Nanako is voiced by Estelle (my waifu) <br> Nep is voiced by Mitsuru <br><br>I'm still amazed by Tanaka Rie and her Nep voice.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Dojima is prof OAK, a Jojo and fucking Jet </br>  Hi /v/ don't shitpost my waifu and I'll allow you here, thanks.  <br>Oh, it's that one autistic Yukarifag.</br>  Pure sex.   third movie does not have Akihiko breakdown <br> it does not have everyone evolving persona <br> just shitpei <br><br>JUST...</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to break her with my dick and there's nothing you can do about it.</br>  <br> does not have Akihiko breakdown <br>What the fuck.<br>That's like, the best scene in the whole game. I cried like a little bitch during that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The movies aren't really good adaptations. I watch it mostly for animated Yukari.</br>    Best girl.  <br> The watergun looks like a penis </br>  Here's a better megaten with better girls.  <br>That glasses one is hella cute.</br>  <br><br><br> anyone else than Makoto <br><br>Fumi and Otome are acceptable too.<br><br> Also i cant fucking find health exam pic. Any help ? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> like Yukiko as a character more <br> like Rise's appearance more <br><br>What to do?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck both like a real nigga.</br>  <br>Do P3 movies sell well?<br>As a P3fag I did enjoy the game 7 years ago but in 2015 I feel like the movie would need to surpass the game to sell as its story is a bit edgy.</br></br>    <br>Where's the glasses girl?</br>  <br>First movie sold really well while the second not so much if I remember correctly, both were cinema hits though.</br>  Hot sentai cosplay sex, dating Yukari would be the best. <br><br>What's she studying in uni anyway?</br></br>  <br>Go away Osaka.</br>    <br><br><br><br>what the fuck guys. have you forgotten me?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That´s not Aspect Raidou.</br>  <br>you right. that's the cooler raidou<br><br>nigga raidou</br></br></br>    <br> Shinjiro voiced by Best Character: the VA <br>Makes sense to me.</br></br>  Do you rate the Persona 3 movies more highly than the Persona 4 TV series?  <br>Absolutely.</br>  <br>Definitely. They're just so much better that it's insane. Still only just a little above average as far as movies go, especially since it's an adaptation.</br>  <br>No, not really.<br>It has significantly better production values but I liked the TV series' pacing more.</br></br>  <br> He doesn't play undub </br>  <br><br> Kana Ueda is the new girl in Persona 5 </br></br>  <br>Here's Doomguy.</br>    <br>I really fucking hate atlus for this, especially because the VAs they get for persona are amazing.</br>  <br>It's not really saying a lot seeing as none of the persona 4 TV series were really all that good.</br>  <br> /v/'s shit taste invading /a/ <br><br>Pls no. Yukiko is fucking garbage.</br></br></br>  <br>Only /v/ hates yukiko, yukiko is the classic japanese beauty.</br>  <br>Yukiko is generic as fuck and has a dull as fuck personality <br><br>2/10 at most</br></br></br>  <br> Anzu <br> voiced by Kana Ueda <br><br>BASED ATLAS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mitsuru a best</br>  Favourite girl from each game?<br><br>Persona: Eriko<br>Persona 2 IS: Lisa<br>Persona 2 EP: Eriko<br>Persona 3: Yukari<br>Persona 4: Yukiko</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I'm taller than all of them </br>  <br> Actually playing the first two persona games <br><br>Didn't the gameplay put you off?</br></br></br>  <br>Persona: None<br>Persona 2: Lisa<br>Persona 2 EP:Lisa<br>Persona 3: Aigis<br>Persona 4: Naoto</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only animation wise, they skip way too much shit in the P3 movies.</br>  <br>Well yeah, cramming an 80 hour game down to 6 hours is obviously gonna cut a shitton. At least it looks nice.</br>    <br> get absolute god tier VA for JP Persona  <br> hire the most bottom of the barrel shit for your english dub who you can't even retain the roles for <br> we are proud of our dubs and don't want you to have options  <br><br>How is this allowed in this day and age I want P5 on the PC just so I can mod the sound files.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> he thinks persona 4 jap sub was good </br>  <br>Get the Japanese version then.</br>  <br>Meh it looks nice and all but i prefer the P4 anime despite it looking like shit. <br><br><br>Why is this even a movie series by the way?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is this even a movie series by the way? <br>Money</br></br>  <br>They added in anime original stuff too to make the ken/shinjiro thing have more of an impact.</br>  <br>FeMC &gt; MC<br><br>Theo &gt; Elizabeth<br><br>Also Mitsuru and Yukari are much better in FeMC route not to mention dating Akihiko and Shinji is better then Yukari and Fuuka.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Naoto has a gun.<br><br><br> Game about Rise <br> Laura Bailey is being replaced by fucking Ashley Burch <br> Probably no dual-audio <br><br>No reason to buy this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I did until they skipped all of the persona evolutions in the 3rd movie. Now they are about equal until I see how the last movie is handled.</br>  <br>Aside from Teddie and Rise they were better and now you have Burch as Rise.</br>  <br>What the fuck is this? an addition to the remake game?<br><br>About time to replay huh.</br></br></br>   Someone posts fanart of all the Persona protags <br> P1 Guy <br> Tatsuya <br> MC <br> FeMC <br> Yu <br> Even Potter-kun <br> No Maya <br><br>Why does this happen every time? I think this has helped me come to hate Portable and FeMC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want a mainline anime, is that too much to ask?</br>  <br>No, I grew up with older style RPGs. <br><br>Hell, I initially played through IS with a Japanese bootleg I got in Cambodia for the Playstation. <br><br><br>Being genki is a crime it seems. Also doesn't help that she didn't get a translated game until the PSP version which would have limited market penetration.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn I want to fuck Otome</br>  <br>Not really, kanji and chie sounded terrible in the jap version. <br><br> and now you have Burch as Rise <br>That only matters if you're gonna get the shitty dancing game.</br></br></br></br>  I fell in love with Mitsuru  <br> Ruining a perfectly good romp with shouldn't-be-canon and Marge <br>Whatever cunt</br></br>  <br>I think Theo is better then Ellie anyway. He's more amusing and better looking.  In all honestly FeMC's route was better anyway </br>  <br> kanji sounded terrible <br> Tomokazu Seki <br> terrible <br>You fucking infidel</br></br></br></br>  <br> They just boogie so hard Makoto comes back to life and pulls off a dance which makes humanity happy to be living at the same time as Makoto. <br>Where do I purchase this master piece.</br></br>  So which SEES do you guys think has it worse after P3 ending? SEES member with MC or FeMC as its leader?<br><br>MC has Yukari going full angst during the Answer, but FeMC was pretty darn close to everyone in the team.</br></br>  <br>FeMC because she was actually a likeable character and better written then MC. I hate it when people say she's not canon, she's more canon then him.</br>  <br>WHEN THE MOON'S REACHING OUT STARS<br><br><br>They're fine in Arena. I mean they hold Door-kun dear but they continued with their lives. <br><br>Except Elizabeth 'cause she's searching for a way of freeing him</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Marie is tuturu <br>It's like poetry</br></br>  <br> poetry <br>Eyyyyy</br></br>  <br><br>she technically is canon, someone explained how but i forgot what they said</br></br>  <br> Kanji and chie sounded terrible in the jap version. <br>You clearly have hearing problems</br></br>  <br> Kanji <br> Terrible <br>Mongrel</br></br></br>  <br>No she's not.</br>  <br>After the loss of old m8 I would sort of like this. The reasoning would be an asspull but as long as it's a cool ass pull it would solve a lot of shit. Give a new iconic velvet room guy and bring back the door. <br><br><br>Good is different from better anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is. MCfags just hate to admit it. She fits much better with Persona 4 (canon sequel) then MC does as well.</br>  <br>Marie's poetry had me vomiting in stanzas.</br>  <br>That's elizibest to you m8</br>  <br>I'm mad because we don't get Jun Fukuyama in our release of 5. I would prefer the other games in Jap too, don't get me wrong. Akira Ishida is MC and all and I fucking hate JYB and Yuri Lowenthell.</br>  <br> Marie's everything <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br>I'll play the first two when they port it to something I can run. <br>As for P3 and P4 Elizabeth and Chie <br>Flawless right?</br></br></br>  <br> Being this fucking wrong </br>  <br>Not at all, man. I don't really get why it would. I've played lots of games, you know? It took some time to get used too but once I did it was a great ride.</br>  <br>No. Stop spouting bullshit.</br>  <br>Mitsuru is. The scene where she stands up for FeMC and sexual equality when she threatens to kick Junpei off the team comes to mind. She's a way better character. Yuka-tan just because she doesn't go full angst.</br>  <br> You will never get a dual audio Persona game <br><br>This sucks. They've already exhausted whatever good talent you can find in this shit anime/video game VAs pool. Even regulars like Troy Baker and Laura Bailey are "too good" for anime these days. What is their fucking problem with dual audio?</br></br></br>  <br> mfw Potter-kun is Ryner </br>  <br> Troy Baker and Laura Bailey <br><br>I am so fucking sick of hearing their voice. I shudder at the thought I'll have to sit through them again in P5. And Yuri Lowenthell.</br></br></br>  <br> Except Elizabeth 'cause she's searching for a way of freeing him <br> Liz does all the work and people still think Aigis is the canon love interest.  <br>I will vomit blood if they do eventually cash in (like anyone thinks they won't after DAN) and it's aigis he ends up with. If anything the trio of undying devotees would be okay but if Liz gets shafted, so help me.</br></br></br>  I don't even mind the persona English dubs.<br><br>Why does everyone hate it so much?</br></br>  FeMC best girl.  <br>At least they have the option to turn off voice acting.<br><br>To be honest, even if it had the Jap dub I might be using that option as I do in some games. Hearing segments of lines while tapping X or triangle to advance is pretty annoying even without the terrible acting on top.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate 3 because of MC and Junpei's voices. 4 because of literally everyones.</br>  <br> MC and Junpei's voices <br> MC voice <br>What.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's review. <br>Appearances of Door<br>P3<br>P3 FES<br>PQ<br>P3 Movies<br><br>Appearances of FeMC<br>P3P<br><br>References to door<br>P4A<br>P4A:U<br>Trinity Soul<br><br>References to FeMC <br>None except a tangential nod with Theo appearing in PQ. <br><br>She is either non canon or sequestered into a non significant alt world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Junpei sounds alright in the game though.</br>  <br> tfw it will never happen </br>  <br> Yuri Lowenthal <br> Vic Mignogna <br><br>I can't stand these two Yuri's voice is so fucking annoying and I came to resent Vic's voice long ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought Junpei was one of the better voices in P3.<br> MC voice <br>He did make some goofy sounds in battle if you wore fist weapons I guess.</br></br></br>    <br>Most silent train ride ever.</br>  <br><br> Shit talking toaster and nympho two of the three best girls in the game <br>Door could have it a lot worse.</br></br></br>  <br>never liked him</br>   Enemy Eliminated    <br>The only good thing about the P4 animation was Yu</br>  <br>I'll admit Junpei's voice is a better example of Vic Mignogna. My dislike for it is mostly just my general dislike of Vic though. MC's I can't excuse at all, especially when his jap voice is Akira Ishida. I can't even imagine him always talking with Yuri's annoying voice in the movies.</br>  <br>There was tranny in portable.</br>  <br>This.<br>I liked him more than I should.</br></br>  <br>P2 is worth it for the characters and the story in my opinion.</br>  Is the movie like the game, where it starts off pretty great but goes to complete shit the moment Aigis Sue shows up and kills the plot dead?  <br>Who is the most ikemen on that train, /a/?</br>  <br> Including FeMC <br> Not even changing it up by having orpheus  <br>She literally just takes up a slot and looks samey as shit. <br><br><br> Mechanical whirring on the post game read out </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awesome, using it as my desktop</br>    <br>Troy Baker isn't voicing Kanji anymore, look up the VAs for Arena</br>  <br> what is undbub <br>baka baka!</br></br>    <br>Those tits are certainly not complimenting that hair</br>  <br>Door, no question. He's the bishounen of the group, Yu is the manly one, and Potter-kun is the normal one. At least the glasses and the general appearance imply that. His coloring is a lot duller than either of the other ones too.</br>  <br>Yeah I know that, but I'm sure he'll have a new role in P5. And if he doesn't Laura Bailey will at least.</br>  <br>This actually would be a pretty good way to subtitude Igor, do it Atlus, do it!</br>  <br>Why two Thanatos? Is it supposed to be their Awakening or something? Messiah and Orpheus Telos would be better, I think.</br>  <br>Fuck i remember when rise was on TV doing her strip shit i think and then yu was pressing the recording button multiple times.</br>    <br>I would too, but having the FemMC there just kills it for me. Looking at two Thanatos' would be annoying too, but mostly because of autism.</br>  ITT: Anime better than their manga.    you first  Hidamari Sketch<br>Nichijou<br>Gintama<br>JoJo<br>SZS</br></br></br></br>  <br>pic unrelated?</br>  <br>D gray man</br>  <br> picture not related <br>There are some things Sidonia anime did better, like the beginning where Nihei stumbles and jumps around or the part of S2 they rearranged so Numi doesn't keep pet gauna just because.<br>What anime (with that kind of budget) couldn't fully replicate is Nihei's glorious architecture and I don't really like how they changed and left out some events in S1 though that's most likely because of limiting number of episodes and pacing issues.<br>Anyway love both. It's great to see Guardians flying around or Nagate getting kicked by Honokas in slow motion.<br> Also Enajiro calling in Guardian kills gives me a boner every time. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 0/10 </br>  <br>Prison School</br>    <br>Still waiting for OP to start.</br>  Honey and Clover<br><br>Nodame<br><br>Paradise Kiss<br><br>Pretty much most josei titles because of the budget/art.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> JoJo <br>Parts 1 and 2 yeah. 3 didn't transition so well.</br></br>  <br> SZS </br>  <br>yeah I forgot to mention it</br>  <br>fuck off newfag</br>   Reacted Selector is a concept pack with cards that are different from anything released up until now.   <br><br>I dropped this after the first episode but i am willing to give it another try because i like card animes.<br><br>is it worth watching?</br></br></br></br>  Is this Umr or Tawil level 5?  <br><br>She looks like a fluffy sheep, without the fluff.</br></br>  <br><br>Probably both like Mayu is LVL 5 of Tama and Iona.<br><br><br>They don't go into detail of the card game just so you know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The anime is about anything but the card game.</br>  <br> headwings <br>pffffffff ahahahahaha</br></br>  <br>Their daughter.</br>  <br>That nothing new.</br>  <br>One of my favorite anime of the year.

You can see the road much better from the left seat.</br>  <br>They also drive on the left side</br>  Why is everyone I meet on webxoss playing either Mayu or Vermilion Ulith?  <br>Because people can't afford to play them in real life.

Damn physical cards.</br></br></br>  Way to undo Vegeta's character development.  <br> It's not insignificant, it shows that in the end Vegeta finally realizes what Goku has over him and admits that Goku is stronger than him. <br><br>So what's the message? <br><br>  I said that would be the only difference, not that it was the reason for the scene. <br><br>What was the reason for the scene exactly? How did it develop the character? He was obsessed with Goku before. He is obsessed with Goku now. <br><br>According to you, Vegeta didn't have a change of heart at all. You say that it will only affect his fighting style. Who gives a shit? Seriously. So. Fucking. Insignificant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>toriyama still hates vegetafags with a burning passion<br><br>now he's being downgraded from ensemble darkhorse to background sidekick<br><br>much like piccolo</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> toriyama still hates vegetafags <br>the hell are you talking about</br></br>  Why does Toriyama hate the most popular Sayian?  Resurrection of F subs: http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx<br><br>Don't know if you can download the full subtitles yet, but the individual files are there</br></br>  <br><br>Toriyama has stated in numerous interviews that he doesn't get people who like vegetta and he only kept him there because of his popularity.<br><br>Basically he only pitties the poor manlet</br></br></br></br>  WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE DRAGON TEAM SUBS  <br>Is this the only known rip and english sub of RoF?<br>Cause I went to the links and they were removed.</br></br>  <br>There are more links at the bottom, and those worked for me<br><br>Is sub anon around? He might have working links he could upload</br></br></br>  ep 2's shit<br><br>i have a feeling the show'll go into the dumpster pretty soon</br></br>  <br>I get the same feeling, which is really saddening. I thought this shit would have a lot of potential, but it's already filler, and killing characters.</br>  <br>Oh I thought it was a japanese rip. Are the subs english then?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4wG<wbr>84efH4sw</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Well at the very least the SOL stuff seems to be ending next week with the start of the BOG arc. But I'm not too thrilled about them redoing the movies.</br>  <br>Yeah some guy here decided to sub it in english for everybody <br><br>Pretty based</br></br></br>  Is this the greatest sol anime of our time /a/?  <br><br>Same here. Just uninspired work thus far. And wow the animation is grating in a way I can't really put my finger on. I actually found myself skipping through the Beerus scenes since I hated the way they were animated.</br></br>  <br>Bardock sounds like a bogan.</br>  <br>Very disappointing movie. Such a shame.</br>  Why is Beerus being shown as such an asshole in Super as opposed to the necessary force of nature in Battle of the Gods?  <br>Because Mr.Buu wouldn't give him any pudding</br>  <br>because people want a bad guy</br>  Isn't this kinda low for Vegeta?  <br>He realized he's fodder compared to Arale.</br>  <br>he stopped training for a week and lost all his gains</br>  <br>He's a cat, I assume it's a joke of some sort. He's only calm when he's curious. In the movie it was about super saiyan god form.</br>  <br><br> Phoenix_Wright.jpg </br></br>  <br> Way to undo Vegeta's character development <br> Dragon Ball super <br>Somehow I feel like someone got the wrong idea about Vegeta character development.</br></br></br>  <br>What? He still acknowledge that Goku was much stronger than him and he may not be able to catch up but that doesn't mean that he was going to stop trying surpass him as shown in the episode.</br>  <br><br>.srt files; how the fuck do they work?</br></br>  <br>Nevermind, i am retarded.</br>  <br>I don't know about all that, but Vegeta is undefeated against Goku.</br>    <br> but it's already filler <br><br>Look at these faggots not wanting full on sol DB.</br></br></br>  <br>Because now we're seeing Beerus doing his job as opposed to fucking around because he wants a good fight.</br>  <br>We never actually saw Beerus destroy planets before. Now we are. That won't change the events to come and how his personality is</br>   buu saga <br>Vegeta in training capsule 400g<br> super <br>Vegeta in training capsule 150g <br>what went wrong?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just warm up, also Vegeta training at 400 G was not in Kai.</br>  <br>It was 150g in the Buu Saga too. It was 300g in the Android Saga though.</br>  <br>he's turning into a soft family man unlike his counterpart who avoids his family at all cost</br>  <br><br>fucking Toriyama man, why he hates Vegeta sooo much?</br></br>  <br> soft family man <br>He was really rejective towars Bulma in the resort. Do Bulma and vegeta even sleep in one bed?<br><br>I do hope that they keep his "My Bulma" rage, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why he hates everybody besides Goku?</br>  <br><br>Goku represented healthy ambition because he was fighting for its own sake. He just enjoyed becoming stronger.<br><br>Vegeta, on the other hand, represented unhealthy ambition. He was obsessed with surpasses Goku and it ate away at him inside. During the Kid Buu fight, he finally let go of his obsession. He accepted the fact that we was weaker and was ok with it. <br><br>But now he is obsessed again and thinks about surpassing Kakarot 24/7. He can't even enjoy his family trip because of his obsession. Vegeta is back at where he started.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I think Vegeta had the right idea. The maddest gains seem to be gotten from training in heavy gravity.</br>  <br> Consistency  <br> Dragonball <br>Toriyama literally forgot super saiyan 3 existed.</br></br></br>  Damn. I hoped to find out something about Bra. Bulma could've mentioned being pregnant or it could've been implied that they had unprotected sex. But nothing. <br><br>Will Bra be forgotten? ;__;</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Samefag</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bra is still about 4 years away from being conceived or born.</br>  <br><br>Why doesn't he employ a fanboy who reminds him of stuff? Hell, I would do it for free.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't BoG just around the corner? So Pan is already on the way soon. Pan doesn't look much older than Bra.</br></br>  <br> KAIOKEN <br> UP TO TEN TIMES <br><br>Never gets old.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They did, that's the job of the guy who made AF.</br>  The three arcs will all take place before Uub. <br><br>Mark my words. That means: No Pan or Bra adventures. I'm sure of it.</br></br>  <br>Why is it so hard for you to do the math? The epilogue of DBZ takes place 10 years after Buu Saga. Bra and Pan are about 4/5 years old in the epilogue. Super takes place 6 months after Buu Saga and is a different retelling of BoG.</br>  <br> Toriyama literally forgot super saiyan 3 existed. <br>And the fact that Saiyan tails are supposed to grow back 6 months after being cut<br>And the exploitable power boost a saiyan gets when he comes near death (it was never used as a means of powering up after Vegeta fought Frieza)<br>And Launch<br>And the way the whole concept of "death" for sinners in the DB universe is supposed to work<br>And if you consider Dragonball Minus canon, that opens up another whole can of worms even if you don't consider Bardock's OVA to be canon. <br><br>Probably a ton of other shit too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bra and Pan are about 4/5 years old in the epilogue <br><br>How do you know that? I don't remember their exact age ever being mentioned. <br><br>We know that Pan is in Videl's stomach when Beerus arrives on earth and he will arrive soon.<br><br> is a different retelling of BoG <br><br>So you're saying that Goku will transform into a SSG without Pan?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not Bardock</br>  <br> Probably a ton of other shit too. <br><br>Yep: <br><br>- Dragonballs can only revive people within a year<br>- Gohan's Mystic Form<br>- Half-Saiyans are born with tails <br>- You cannot reach the lookout with a plane</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Becaue The official material states that she is no older than 4 years during the Epilogue.</br>  <br>Animal people also existed on Earth, that made Piccolo and Goku look not so weird among the others but suddenly in Z only humans remained<br>Also<br> Launch <br>She only had cameo at the end of Z and her "angry" form also looks like super saiyan prototype.</br></br></br></br>  <br> becoming a background like piccolo and tenshinhan <br> development <br>The only way to be relevant in this universe is being strong.</br></br></br>  <br>We all know that. They won't go past the end of the manga</br>  <br> How do you know that? I don't remember their exact age ever being mentioned.  <br>We know Pan is 4 because that's what was told to us<br><br> We know that Pan is in Videl's stomach when Beerus arrives on earth and he will arrive soon. <br> So you're saying that Goku will transform into a SSG without Pan? <br>It's possible that they are changing the timeline around. If the ritual takes place the same way, that means Pan will be in Videl's stomach now instead of 4 years later when BoG took place indicating the timeline is being changed around</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's really sad though. No Pan, no Bra, no teen Goten and Trunks, nothing can happen that contradicts the ending of the manga, i.e. no relevant characters can die, break up or change their attitude and/or appearance too much.</br></br>  <br> - Gohan's Mystic Form <br>When was that forgotten? It was in the movie and in the OP for the new series<br> - You cannot reach the lookout with a plane <br>I believe it was that God would not let you reach the temple by plane but since Dende knows Goku and crew, he lets it happen</br></br></br></br>  <br>there were animal people in Z, but they were a lot less common and most of them showed up early on.</br>  <br>Well, as I said here , if the events that happen in BoG are the same (they could be different but I'm going off that assumption), that is already changing the timeline around since Super is six months after the end of Boo saga.<br><br>It's common knowledge that Toriyama didn't like the way he ended his manga saying he thought he made everyone too old so maybe this is part of him ignoring it for a new story.</br></br></br>  <br> Super is six months after the end of Boo saga. <br>No, People's memories being erased is 6 months after Boo saga. Super is an unspecified amount of time after that.</br></br>  <br><br> Base Gohan powering up is now Mystic Gohan <br><br>Gohanfags, when will they learn?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the episode synopsis for episode 1 specifically says 魔人ブウとの激闘から半年。 "Six months after the fierce battle with Majin Boo"</br>  If Whis can control time, then why is he in a hurry to get the dinosaur meat?  <br>Base Gohan doesn't have the lock of hair in the front. Ultimate does. That's how you can tell the difference.</br>  Probably best not to fuck with time just for a sandwich.  <br>Whis is being a dick. Beerus is being a dick. Having too much power makes them toy with others.</br>  <br>Gohan looks like such nerd.</br>  <br>reminder that Vegeta was in Super Saiyan form during the 400g</br>  <br>i don't understand how gohan became more of a bitch the older he got<br><br>is it chi chis fault or gokus?</br></br></br>  What do you guys think of Gohan's new SS hair?<br><br><br><br>He stopped training. You never stop training. Just look at Yamcha?</br></br></br></br>  <br> And the exploitable power boost a saiyan gets when he comes near death <br><br>He didn't forget that, it's explained that the only saiyan who really understands it is vegeta and he hates using it because of how shameful it is.<br><br>He would probably let picolo fuck him in the ass before he took a dive for a power up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both. Goku was always dead so he couldn't steal Gohan away, and because of that Chi-chi forced him into scholastics constantly and turned him into a goober, also the fact that nothing at all fucking happened between Cell and Buu.</br>  So since dragon team subs are confirmed not happening, which sub group do I follow? Anime rg?  <br>I think it's just the marketing guys being stupid. The opening shows him going Ultimate rather than using SSJ.</br>  <br>Either way you could cut open cans on that stray hair.</br>  We could've had based Gohan.<br><br>But Toriyama is a bitch.</br></br>  <br> He would probably let picolo fuck him in the ass before he took a dive for a power up. <br><br>Thanks doc</br></br></br>  <br><br>In RoF Gohan out and out says he hasnt been training and is unsure if h can even go ssj<br><br>Tori didnt forget. He's surrounded by assistants who would remind him of shit anyway. This "Toriyama forgets everything" meme needs to stop. He usually just cuts stuff out for the sake of storytelling (like the zenkai powerup)</br></br></br></br>  <br> And the exploitable power boost a saiyan gets when he comes near death (it was never used as a means of powering up after Vegeta fought Frieza) <br><br> it was never used as a means of powering up after Vegeta fought Frieza </br></br></br>  i don't get you people. What the point of powering Gohan and making him less of a jobber if this show is really only about Vegeta and Goku. He'll never be anything more than a side character now and it's just fine that he's a scholar. He wasn't ever shown to be much into fighting anyway.  <br>Dragon Team just comes out late.<br><br>From my experience other than them, Sensui seemed the least shit out of the speed subbers. Don't use RG</br></br></br>  <br>Still the best dad in the franchise</br>  <br>The rpoblem lies in Toriyama, not Gohan,<br><br>After Cell all was set for Gohan to inherit the role of main defender.<br><br>Not because he liked fighting, but because if anything he was the strongest person left to defend the Earth and Goku used up his ressurection limit.<br><br>But Toriyama was not sure if he wanted to abandon Goku and in the end he didn't.<br><br>I mean, remove Goku from Buu Saga and replace him with Gohan, it still fucking works.<br><br>Gohan vs Majin Vegeta who is jealous of his talent.<br>Gohan loses SSJ and has to unlock his inner strength.<br>Fnal fight is Ultimate Gohan vs Kid Buu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was not Toriyama but Jap fans and editors who wanted Goku back, Toriyama tried to remove Goku from the beginning of Z.</br>  <br>Not denying that. I just think it's silly that people demand more for Gohan, eventhough it's futile because his creator himself couldn't give him the main character spot.</br>  <br> But Toriyama was not sure if he wanted to abandon Goku and in the end he didn't. <br>Also Gohan wasn't popular as the main character</br></br>  <br>This. Goku was MC that made sells.</br>  <br>That is a myth and was confronted before.<br><br>It was Toriyama's own decision.<br>In the end of Cell Saga he wanted to make Gohan the main character but after thinking he wanted this story to be Goku's from start to finish.</br></br></br></br>  i miss king ki's goofy english voice  <br><br>Except we have him on record, in an interview, talking about the stuff he forgot. Like, he forgot that SSJ2 was a thing. He thought SSJ3, with the long hair, was SSJ2, and forgot there was a form in between.</br></br>  <br>Viz scans where??</br>  If you don't like the SoL you can feel free to fuck straight off. Dragon Ball hasn't been this fun since the Cell saga filler.  <br>You make it sound like that was recent and not like 5 years ago before he started working on BoG and reread the whole manga for</br>  <br><br>Did you watch BoG? If Super follows BoG's plot, then we should get plenty of Vegeta development. We have Vegeta giving up his pride to save his family, and Vegeta becoming even stronger than Goku for a moment when his family is threatened.</br></br>  where the fuck is the subbed episode?<br>haruhichan has nothing</br>  http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>9/dragon-ball-super-episode-3-infor<wbr>mation-revealed/<br><br> Kuririn This Week <br> Hurry to Bulma’s Birthday Party! <br> Kuririn and family head by car to Bulma’s birthday party on a luxurious passenger ship! But they get stuck in a traffic jam…?! </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br> Chi-chi forced him into scholastics constantly and turned him into a goober, <br> implying <br>Gohan NEVER liked fighting,understandably so. He was assigned when he was a toddler to a fucking abusive slug who beat him up daily and threw him into mountains to awaken his "Hidden strength", all to fight two alien guys who killed almost all of his friends and later an alien overlord that killed the only remaining friend he had in front of him. It's already a miracle he turned out same, him not liking fighting is the bare minimum.</br></br></br>  Doc is here now. Make sure to take your regular dosage.  <br><br>He cut way too much though. RoF never made any sense. Even if Freeza powers up, his army shouldn't have been any challenge. <br><br>Leaving Gohan aside for now, RoF had to figure out excuses to get EVERY capable Z-fighter not named Goku or Vegeta to either job or just be busy. <br><br>Trunks and Goten? They didn't tell them cause it was too dangerous. Even though they're individually able to go SSJ, and when fused they can go SSJ3. <br><br>Buu? Convinently hibernating. <br><br>Picolo? Somehow seems to be back at his Namek saga power levels, even though he fused with Kami. <br><br>18, who was able to easily beat future Trunks, who in turn was able to one-shot original Freeza? Did they even bother explaining where she was? Krilin should've stayed home to watch the baby, and 18 went to fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*sane</br>  <br>Sensui released a half decent copy. <br><br>Honestly though, why are you complaining?

Sorry, as much as fun it was, total bullshit.</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>11174<br><br>Best copy till later today</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> Best copy till later today <br>which sub comes out later? Dragon Team?</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>But he did enjoy his family trip. Again, he still acknowledge that Goku was stronger and maybe will always be stronger but he also still want to try and surpass Goku. That's like saying that you know that there is a lot of smarter people in the world but you still try to become the smartest. Maybe you couldn't do it but at least you try.</br>  <br>Is that "G" as in 10^9?</br>  i'm enjoying it if only to see the prince of all saiyans regret every single one of his life choices  I really dont like king kai's japanese voice.  <br>In the manga, he's never actually shown training in 300G, is he?</br>  <br> Trunks and Goten? They didn't tell them cause it was too dangerous. Even though they're individually able to go SSJ, and when fused they can go SSJ3. <br>No, they didn't tell them because they're too reckless. Look at all the destruction caused in Son Goku and Friends Returns even though they were dealing with someone weaker than them, and someone who was by themselves, without an army.<br><br> 18, who was able to easily beat future Trunks, who in turn was able to one-shot original Freeza? Did they even bother explaining where she was? Krilin should've stayed home to watch the baby, and 18 went to fight. <br><br>She stays to protect her daughter in the beginning of the movie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Future Gohan so much cooler than present Gohan?  I don't get it, didn't they just have a movie with Beerus?<br><br>Why are they making arc all of a sudden?</br></br>  <br>Because at the time of the Buu Saga Toriyama somehow decided that enjoying fighting is something completely inhumane and only pure Saiyans are allowed to do that.</br>  <br>It's a remake of the movie. <br><br>Personally, I guess that this is all basically filler to give more time for Toriyama to come up with the original story and designs for the Universe 6 stuff later.</br></br></br>  <br> It's a remake of the movie <br>That's lazy as fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Because he was grizzled and emotionally complex after seeing everyone he loved get fucking murdered by androids, unlike present Gohan who's a crybaby nerd.</br></br>  <br>Wait so Goku is only training on a 10G planet while Vegita is training in a 150G room? Why doesn't Goku find a better place to train? you think that would be too easy of a workout to really improve.</br>  <br>He's training with weights on the 10G planet though, while Vegeta isn't using weights on 150G.</br>  <br>Well, he couldn't exactly say "editors and polls forced me to change the story" even if it was the truth, could he?</br>  <br><br>Technically it's a remake of the movies. They're doing battle of gods now and then they're gonna do resurrection of F and then move onto new stuff in the parallel universe where beerus is fat and whis has a vagina.</br></br>  <br>forced to become a warrior due to circumstances and kinda forced to be like a dad to trunks since everyone else was dead<br><br>present gohan got it so damn easy compared to future gohan, i doubt future gohan would have bitched about sitting down for a while to get a huge power up from a creepy old kai<br><br>also have a picture</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta also tired out after like a minute of dodging lasers. Goku is pacing himself and slowly pushing his limits without over exerting his body.</br>  can we discuss how bad Kaio's seiyuu is phoning in his lines?<br>I already noticed it a bit last episode as the narrator, but as Kaio it stands out more since there's a visual representation that seems unsynched with the voice.</br>  <br>because kaio's place is the best place to train in<br> no chichi <br> no children <br> lots of food <br> kaio is a bro </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not 300G <br>Vegeta please...</br></br>  <br>he's really, really old<br>he's trying his best but he just can't do voice acting like he used to</br></br>  i liked gt<br>it wasn't bad</br>  I don't get why he was angry at the octopus  <br>the shadow dragons were cool, i liked haze shenron (the frog looking one) and this chick</br>  <br>he's only 60kg?</br>  <br>Nova shenron masterrace</br>  <br>i enjoyed the whole thing especially baby vegeta and baby in general<br>i didn't enjoy how buu and uub where push overs though, even if uub wasn't that powerful buu should have been, and it didn't change when they fused<br>i enjoyed the shadowdragons too, overall the ending actually felt like an ending instead of how dbz ended and i loved the last episode<br> i rate it higher than dbz, it was a lot faster and it wasn't as serious which is why i love dragon ball so much <br><br>maybe i'm just a dragondrone though and i'll like any pile of shit they hand out</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no no, he forgot super saiyan 2 existed<br>he thought SS2 was the one with long hair</br></br>  <br>Because he was even more forced to fight under that timeline's circumstances, so there you go. His chances became definitely unexistant.</br>  So what will the Universe 6 shit end up being? A huge martial arts tournament vs their counterparts?  how would you rate the show so far?  <br>fillernoplot/10</br>  <br> Multiverse bullshit <br><br>Frog, pls.</br></br></br>  <br>8/10 for me. And that's because the animation is shit.<br><br>Loving the SoL.</br></br></br>  <br>No it's Gravity.<br>He's training in Gravity 150 times that of Earth's.<br><br>He's warming up. Or Tori forgot</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't, the fans do.</br>  <br><br>Vegeta realized that he shouldn't half kill himself everytime he trains.</br></br>  <br>i'm very much the same, even if dragonball super eventually turns out to be shit i'm gonna love it all the same</br>  <br>Isn't Bra supposed to be older than Pan?</br>  <br>9/10, I'm having a lot of fun with but the music is inferior to DBZ. I'm talking programmed guitars kind of inferior.</br>  <br>I thought she was a year younger?</br>  <br><br><br>For the 141624th time.<br><br>Pan is older than Bra. <br><br>GT staff messed messed up their ages(and made them look like jailbait), but in the booklets states Bra is younger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but he should for the zenkai boost</br>  <br>ok nigger calm down</br>  <br>he's tired within 30 seconds of starting his training</br>  <br>150G is the warmup<br>300G is base super saiyan level training</br></br>  <br>I'll be Frodo for a moment and ask why they just don't fly there.</br>  <br>Wouldn't he be "Other Past Gohan" now?</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4w<wbr>G84efH4sw</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8XS<wbr>eBLPU_s4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>He's basically like Vince McMahon.<br><br> HOW DARE THESE PEOPLE LIKE A CHARACTER? I KNOW, I'LL MAKE HIM A FUCKING JOBBER, THAT'LL TEACH THEM <br><br><br>Read the headscratchers section of Dragon Ball GT on tvtropes, you'll have a blast.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Either he's bringing stuff in the car or he's going by car so they don't have to worry about dropping the baby.</br></br>  <br>People got their memory erased, flying freaks out everyone.<br>Just like in the first and this episode.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's just me, but the native Malaysian language somehow still sounds unfitting even on actual Malaysian shows.</br>  <br>That was a fucking terrible voice acting, as if he was reading the whole script without looking at the scene</br>  <br>That now Vegeta is more humble? He finally got over "im prince therefore I'm naturally better".</br>  <br> But now he is obsessed again and thinks about surpassing Kakarot 24/7 <br><br>He LITERALLY says he got over it.<br>He said that now its about becoming the number one and second to none, not just focusing on his husbando</br></br></br></br>  <br> And the fact that Saiyan tails are supposed to grow back 6 months after being cut <br><br>maybe they are, you know, cutting it?<br> And the exploitable power boost a saiyan gets when he comes near death (it was never used as a means of powering up after Vegeta fought Frieza) <br>didn't work really well anyway<br>also goku and vegeta wouldn't use unles they were to be thrown into a corner. Its like using steroids<br> And Launch <br><br>she left<br><br> And the way the whole concept of "death" for sinners in the DB universe is supposed to work <br><br>Only Goku can leave the after life isn't it?<br> - Half-Saiyans are born with tails  <br>When was it shown?<br>Goku was a few months old when he came to earth wasn't him?<br>  but suddenly in Z only humans remained <br><br>rewatch cell saga faggot. The general is an old friend of goku from DB and is a wolf</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  how is this going to tie in with gt ? or does it have nothing to do with it?<br>oh and I was expecting goten and trunks to be grown up by now. kind of disappointed by it not happening.</br>  <br>I bet vegeta being a neglectful pissbaby is to make the THAT'S MUH WIFE scene have more impact because it's the only time he ever surpassed goku.</br>  <br>Right now, we only know about the Universe 6 arc, which should be right after RoF, so it'll have nothing to do with GT.<br><br>The show likely only will step on GT's toes if it goes on for quite a while, at least two years.</br></br></br>  <br>We already know that it's going to be a search for the "Super Dragonballs".</br>  <br>GT has already been retconned out from existence ever since SS God.</br>  <br>This had nothing to do with GT</br>   [DragonTeam] Dragon Ball Super - 002 <br>The good subs are out!</br>  <br>Nope, in Buu Saga all he did was admit Goku was better than him, he never stopped trying to overcome Goku though, he only finally admitted that Goku was better, but even in the manga end Vegeta still wants to challenge Goku, so no his development is consistent.</br>  <br>They're out now</br>  <br>Ahahaha WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU EXPECTING YOU STUPID GULLIBLE FAGGOT?<br><br>it's a DRAGON BALL CASH GRAB SEQUEL, you dumb idiotic mouthbreather, of course they're going to reset everyone to status quo so they can be JUST LIKE OUR FAVORITE DORGAN BOLLZ.<br><br> n-nooo my DEEP and MEANINGFUL character development is not being respected in this colossally moronic fistypunch anime handwaved in by an over-the-hill hack author who needs a few more bucks for his retirement! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Calm down. It's not that serious</br>  <br>No, you can tell by the eyes. When he's calm and his eyes are still triangles, he's probably Mystic. Or some bullshit like that idk.</br>  I'm enjoying it. It's fun, it's not making me feel bad or forcing myself to watch it, and I'm not paying for it, so that's going way better than expected. <br><br>And yes, I know it's hard for /a/ to enjoy things, but just this time maybe?</br></br>  <br>See</br>  <br><br>Why are you guys replying to an obvious shitposter?</br></br>  <br>Watching Dragon Ball Z in spanish? Eww no thanks.</br>  <br><br>Given that they forgot that SSJ 3 exists in the movies, probably they forgot that SSG exists in GT</br></br>  <br>  if this show is really only about Vegeta and Goku <br><br>But that's what is so annoying. Dragonball has such a rich cast of unique characters. Yet, only Goku and Vegeta get to do stuff while everybody else is compltely irrelevant. <br><br>How about we actually let some of the other characters do something meaningful as well? Even if Piccolo, Tien, Gohan, Roshi etc. are useless against the main big bad guy, they can fight minions, or infiltrate an enemy base to gather info, or go on a rescue mission when somebody has been captured etc. <br><br>But no. Everybody who isn't Goku will eventually become useless. Even Gohan who surpassed his dad twice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beats the english dub, at least</br>  <br>It has been that way from the very beggining.</br>  <br> It has been that way from the very beggining <br><br>No. Even though early Dragonball focused on Goku, other characters were heavily involved in what he was doing.</br></br></br>  <br>The movies besides BoG and RoF weren't ever canon<br><br>And the only time when SS3 was actually possible to happen in movies pre BoG was in Fusion Reborn and Wrath of Dragon, and SS3 is used in both of those movies.</br></br></br>  <br> i loved the last episode <br><br>But nothing made sense. It felt rushed and not thought out. <br><br> Goku suddenly has to go away and we are not told where he is going and why <br> Goku and Shenron both know about this although it was never mentioned before <br> Then Goku appears again but it's not explained where he was  <br> It's even unclear if that's the real Goku, his ghost or whatever  <br><br>Nothing made sense. I think people only liked that ending because it had good music and showed scenes that made you feel nostalgic. The plot of the episode itself was absolute garbage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>GT had ok ideas but the execution was bad. The pacing was horrible, the animation worse than Z and DB, the comedy felt forced and the artstyle just looked wrong. It may seem petty but the last point bothers me the most. GT just looks bad imo. The colors don't go well together. Watching GT is like having a meth dream I want to wake up from.</br></br>  <br> Krillin vs Goku <br><br>Still my favorite fight. Tien vs Goku is a close second. Piccolo Jr. vs Goku is nr. 3. <br><br>I liked how their movements looked really interesting. They looked like real martial ARTists. Now they just box and kick in the most generic way possible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The movies besides BoG and RoF weren't ever canon <br><br>Why are you saying "besides"? BoG and RoF are retconned by Super.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Retold != retconned</br></br>  <br><br>The events in Super contradict the events in BoG. They cannot both be canon.</br></br>  <br>BoG and RoF are being retold in Super, it's just the movies expanded into two different arcs and told through episodes, the events of those movies still happen.<br><br><br>No it doesn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Only on minor details.</br></br>  <br>My favorite is Jackie v. Goku. The other fights are technically more impressive but that one was just unique.</br>  <br><br><br>Did Beerus wake up and then tell Whis about dreaming about a SSG while eating or not? <br><br>Whether or not you think this is an important event doesn't matter. It's either part of canon or its not. According to Super, it's not.</br></br></br></br></br>  Best character so far and he gets immediately killed off.  <br> Translation: we don't love these Ho's </br>  <br>But Goku transforms into ssj3<br><br>god so many shitposter fuck this shit I can't help myself and ignore the baits</br></br></br>   Octopus spits out ink faster than Frieza can throw a punch <br><br>Nice reaction time Vegeta.</br></br>  What's up with this silhouette? We never saw Goku looking like that. For some reason, Tori either draws really small children or grown ups in Dragonball. He mostly avoids the in-between. Would've loved to see this Goku, but sadly we didn't.  <br>Sure, if you consider being 5 years off a minor detail.</br>  Vegeta getting his character development undone is part of his character.  <br><br>He let his guard down. Goku was shot by some low-tier gun in RoF because he let his guard down. <br><br>Furthermore, comedy is always stronger. That's why weak female characters can injure shonen superheroes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of Japanese comments about the episode was that it sounds like King Kais voice actor is about to keel over and die.</br>  <br>He'll get it back when beerus slaps the ever loving shit out of bulma. He still cares.</br>    <br> mfw he goes Super Ho </br>  <br> Ho's before Ho's </br>  <br><br>Looks like Vegeta is training with his family.</br></br>  Did none of you read the fucking kanzenban? The very last panel of the manga has Vegeta reaffirming he'll beat Goku someday. This isn't anything new.  <br>pretty sure he looked like that during the piccolo arc in dragon ball.</br>  <br><br>No. He was significantly smaller.</br></br>  <br> And the fact that saiyan tails are supposed to grow back 6 months after being cut. <br>I'mm-a need a citation on this one.<br> And Zenkai <br>I think it's less that Zenkai doesn't exist and more that it never really applies. Even in the cell saga, the saiyans are rarely beaten to within an inch of their lives except maybe when Vegeta encounters the androids. And by then all the opponents they face are so much stronger than them that Zenkai doesn't mean much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The other piccolo fam.</br>  <br><br>That's adult Goku. <br><br>This silhouette  looks like a 10-14yo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet 18 wondered the same thing during the android saga. When will people stop dicking her around in cars for long periods of time.</br>  <br>hohohohohohoho</br>  <br>Yeah but to be fair, Super saiyan 2 looks like...exactly the same. And at the time he'd said that it'd been like a decade since he'd done any Dragonball stuff. I can't be bothered to remember every little detail of a comic I made a decade ago. That's for the obsessive nerdy fans to do.</br>  <br>Well the silhouette looks like how he did at the end of dragon ball, start of Z imo.</br>  <br><br>There is no problem with that because Vegeta doesn't seem too obsessed about it. He's a Saiyan so it's only natural for him to still think about beating strong opponents. However, Vegeta used to be consumed with the idea of surpassing Goku. That's what he supposedly overcame. <br><br>But now he is obsessed again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This "character development" meme needs to stop. If you're not Goku, your character doesn't develop in the Dragon Ball universe. That's it. Done. Stop memeing you meme lords.</br>  So what is canon? BoG and RoF obviously aren't anymore. But what about the Jaco manga and Dragon Ball Minus? And Episode of Bardock? And the movies with Broly and Cooler?  Why is it so hard for most people to follow easy shonen characterization?<br><br> WAAH GIHAN IS A BITCH NOW <br><br>He always was a bitch. He never wanted to fight in the first place. <br>The only times he trained was when Piccolo kidnapped him and Goku forced him to come with him into the time chamber.<br>He only beat Cell because he got a huge rage power-up from seeing his friends and family beaten to death.<br>There was absolutely no reason for him to train anymore after cell was dead.<br>He also got a 10/10 waifu, so he settled down and probably fucked Videl 24/7</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What? Compare that silhouette to the next one. Notice how much taller the next one is? Goku didn't grow any taller after the Piccolo Jr. fight. He only became a little bulkier.</br></br>  <br> Jaco manga and Dragon Ball Minus <br>Canon<br> And Episode of Bardock? And the movies with Broly and Cooler? <br>Not canon</br></br></br></br>  <br>I concur. Especially because hits seemed to really matter. Trading blows seemed more important than just a series of lightning fast kicks and punches. It's also the first time we get to see goku and krillin go all out against one another, and having these two rivals fight is just so satisfying to see. Usually fights were Goku fighting a much larger opponent. This is like one of the opportunities to see Goku fight someone the same height as him who can match him blow for blow.</br>  <br><br>All movies except BoG and RoF were never canon. <br><br>All the other stuff you mention is debatable. Tori said that they are canon, but later he decided that some of them aren't canon after all. So it really depends on his whims now. <br><br>I personally only consider the manga canon and everything else is just called canon by Tori for marketing reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Friendly reminder to read Dragonball.</br>  <br>This walking animations on this is terrible</br>  <br><br>I did and that's just regular adult Goku.</br></br>  <br>Sure he did. He goes from being a bit taller than Bulma to signifigantly taller and bulkier than her.</br>  <br>Same reason why 17 would rather drive a truck than fly during the androids saga<br>They do end up flying though</br></br>  Which day of the week are the eps up?  <br>I like to pretend Episode of Bardock is canon. Mostly because it doesn't really interfere with anything else and I just like Bardock a lot.</br>  <br>What makes him seem obsessed? <br>People keep saying because he didn't enjoy the vacation but he's VEGETA. Of course he didn't enjoy hanging out with a bunch of losers. He'd probably rather be either training or killing some alien monsters or something. That's a vacation for Vegeta.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck I thought Broly was canon. Wasn't he in GT?</br></br>  <br>No, and besides, GT isn't canon.</br>  <br>compare to this</br>  <br>And compare him to everyone else here. He's still got a ways to go.</br>  <br><br>Dude, even if he did become a little bit taller (which is debatable because his height isn't consistent), the last silhouette is a lot taller than the second one. The second silhouette is roughly the size of adult Krillin. Goku was already a lot taller than Krillin when he fought Jr.</br></br>  <br>fuck childhoold = ruined</br>  <br> He'd probably rather be either training or killing some alien monsters or something. <br><br>Then why isn't he killing alien monsters or something? Right, because he is worried that he cannot catch up to Goku when he doesn't spend 90% if his life in that gravity chamber.</br></br></br>  <br>HO HO HO</br>  Has anyone here read the Heroes manga? I always wanted to know if they were any good or not.  <br>*shrugs* I dunno man. Maybe they just wanted to exaggerate the difference in his age. I'm not gonna get all autistic about it.</br>  <br>Because he'd have to get a space ship, go off planet, find an alien planet, kill some aliens, all that shit. And just staying home and training to blow off steam is faster, easier and much more productive.</br>  <br>The last tournament.</br>  <br><br>It could be a fun trip with his son. He could use that opportunity to teach him how to be a proud warrior instead of letting Bulma spoil him all day long. But no: he still only has one top priority in life "MUH KAKAROT".</br></br>  <br><br>Goku wasn't that small  in the Jr. fight. He was roughly the same height as Piccolo himself.</br></br>  Why are people complaining about this? <br>Did they forget Vegeta admitted Goku was the best in the Buu Saga?<br>http://<span>youtu.be/O4Fqeq1VWdE  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Maybe Piccolo also grew.</br>  <br><br>That's why they are complaining. Vegeta was supposed to be ok with Goku being stronger than him now. He is supposed to be free of his unhealthy obsession with him. <br><br>Yet, he still thinks about Goku all day in Super.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He can't even enjoy his family trip because of his obsession. Vegeta is back at where he started. <br>The fact he accepted the family trip at all is a big step over his past self in Z. He's also making sure to keep his promises to his perky son, for Vegeta that really speaks just how much he has got to care for his family.</br></br>  So lets be honest here.<br><br>I literally have no idea whats going on in the manga anymore.<br><br>What the fuck is happening right now?<br>Can anyone fill me in?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The manga only got really popular because of the anime</br>  <br>Unf yes. Please post more, I am loving it.</br>  <br>Sure, but it's still going to happen.<br><br><br>It was already extremely popular, the anime made it even more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it was already popular before the anime. The anime just made it into a household name.</br>  <br>I know they do but they still drive those people away</br>  Why are so many moeblobs among the most powerful characters in the anime/manga/vn/ln medium?  <br>Gap moe</br>  Homura is only universal by proxy and her powers are completely circumstancial so there is really no reason to have her outside special tier.  Give me an explanation why you believe Sakura Kinomoto is above STTGL.  <br> Homura is only universal by proxy <br><br>What do you mean?</br></br></br>  Fiamma shouldn't really be that high other characters in the same tier have just as much NLF going for them except they have feats to back them up.  Because magical girls. If FFT has taught me anything, it's that females make better magicians unless you feel like actually using a mediator.<br><br>Cute little girl with a magic wand, pet fairy, and a cute costume &gt; giant universe-tossing mecha.</br></br>  <br>If this includes characters from VNs, it should also include Shiranui Yoshikazu from Evolimit, who in the final route  ends up chasing the final boss across dimensions, and turns him into a universe by making a Big Bang out of him. </br>  <br> Uchiha Madara that low <br>Surely that's talking about either Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara, Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara or Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano'o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu, and not sagemode sage of the six paths Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Legendary Super Saiyan 4 Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, Rinnegan, Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, and Geass doujutsus, equipped with his Shining Trapezohedron while casting Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann as his Susanoo, with Gold Experience Requiem stand, having become the original vampire after having absorbed Alucard as well as a God Hand, able to tap into the speedforce, wearing the Kamen Rider Black RX suit, with Kryptonian DNA implanted in him and having eaten Popeye's spinach while possessing quantum powers like Dr. Manhattan and having mastered Hokuto Shinken posessing perfect Musou Tensei, Inherited the Hiten Misturugi Ryu style fully mastering the Amakekeru Ryu no Hirameki, Having mastered Gear Fourth and mastered all 3 Haki's, and having graduated top of his class in the Navy Seals, has been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda with over 300 confirmed kills, is also trained in gorilla warfare and is the top sniper in the entire US armed forces.</br></br>  <br>when was the birth of this epic meme?</br>  Beerus is billions of times FTL as of DB Super. That makes Goku also just as fast so he should be higher on the chart.  <br>Moe is power.</br>  <br>Fuck off idiot. Go learn about every other character there before making a retard of yourself.</br>  <br>I've read To Aru and Goku would be easily higher than at least Fiamma.</br>  <br>Index and DBZ aren't even Shaman King tier, they're irrelevant in this chart.</br>  <br> New </br>  I'm ultimate.  What gets someone into the special tier? <br>Seems like some of these gods and demi-gods should probably be in there too. <br><br>When you're comparing powers between characters, how do you do that? Imagine them getting into a fight? No, I think comparing some of their canon feats of power is better. <br><br>Some of the characters who are higher up are clearly higher up based on potential power or examples of massive god-like creative potential, not destructive, which is usually what people are thinking of in a powerlevel discussion. Also, Demonbane should just be so special that he's not even ON the chart and the filename is just "Demonbane.png." Make it with his color scheme or something and PNG so people editing it later don't mess it up by lowering the quality. <br><br><br>It's true. It's like magic or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What gets someone into the special tier? <br>Have crippling weakness(Shit body for example)</br></br>   say that a character is super strong and can pull shit out of his ass for the plot <br> nerds will endlessly debate the relative strengths of that character with other bullshit characters for no reason <br>every time</br></br>   Aselia that high <br>Wait what<br>When did this happen</br></br>  <br>Because Rank 0's are silly</br>  <br> he doesn't understand the ironic counter-switcheroo baitposting maneuver </br>  <br>I just assume everybody that tries to pull that is a newfags trying to fit in hard.</br>  <br>Special tier is for characters who's powers are difficult to measure, and therefore can't be accurately compared to other characters.<br><br>Demonbane is no stronger than other omnipotents.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because the chart is made by retards.<br><br>If you need an example, they have a literally omnipotent being ranked lower than someone who can "do some miracles at the cost of breaking her heart". It has someone who can literally do anything and everything with no downsides at all lower than someone who can't even do half this much and at a cost.</br></br></br></br>  Anime power level chart time? I say so.  <br>Still laughing at how you were stupid enough to spend time editing this.</br>  Just a reminder, anytime you include an omnipotent being in these pictures if they're not at the top by a significant margin you are wrong.<br><br>It doesn't matter if your character is a witch who can edit the plot, or can instantly kill anyone or erase their existence. By definition an omnipotent being is capable of doing this (and more) to a much higher level.<br><br>An omnipotent being has the powers of everyone else in the image + more at a higher level. If they're not at the very top something is wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You must have a laughing problem, go see a doctor</br>  <br>Wrong. Characters who can manually change the meta are above omnipotent.<br><br>You know one character that can beat Elder God Demonbane? The jap author who wrote it. This is also Featherine's ability, so by technicality, she should top the chart.</br></br></br>  <br> featherinefag still forcing this shit <br>You got BTFO'd a shitton of threads ago, just give up.</br></br>  <br><br>No character can "change the plot". They're not capable of inserting themselves into our actual world and changing shit.<br><br>But if we're using that logic. Kami Tenchi is also capable of this, being that he is a self insert of the author.<br><br>Infact, lets make every main character this too. Since it's obvious they will never lose anyway and it doesn't matter how powerful you pretend to be when your special power is the author makes it so you always win in the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go and read Umineko then come back. Featherine was able to write witches out of existence with her book.<br><br>Kami Tenchi is another one.<br><br>Omnipotent characters are only omnipotent because the authors give them that power. If the meta can be changed, so can the character's powers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless of course we maintain witches are not real in the first place</br>  <br><br> Wrote a character out of existence <br><br>So if I go to the Umineko wiki now and type in these witches names, I'll find a blank page?<br><br>Because she's not rewriting the plot if this is not the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Special Tier isn't necessarily for omnipotents or super-broken characters, but rather for characters with strange or vaguely-defined powers that make them hard to classify. For example, Ultimate Madoka is probably god-level and could possibly be near-omnipotent, but her powers are never really defined. I actually think that Akuma Homura never should've left Special since that applies to her too.</br>  <br> confirmed for not having extensively read umineko, specifically episode 8 <br>Even if you assumed that, which conflicts with the meta, of course you assume they exist in these powerlevel comparisons.</br></br>  <br>It's not like these powerlevel battles are taking place in our universe. She wrote them out of the Umineko meta, and provided she came face to face with a character from a different meta like Demonbane or Hajun, she'd be able to do the same to them.</br>  Could Hibiki really beat Nanoha in a straight fight? I ask this as a Geahfag  <br><br>If someones power is to alter the meta, I expect it to effect our actual world. If not then it's not doing shit and someone who is omnipotent is also capable of these feats.</br></br>  <br>It's just amazing how how the most ineffectual witches who do only shit in a most limited scope in a story where unreliable narrators are the theme are championed as 'strongest powerlevel' characters, moreso than any other reality bender/god seen in tons of anime/manga/lns/vns when each universe does not even function the same way</br>  <br> and provided she came face to face with a character from a different meta like Demonbane or Hajun, she'd be able to do the same to them. <br><br>That argument really has no substance. It's not like the universes function on their own and we can observe how things work when characters mix and R07 cannot write these characters in the universe either.<br><br>It's just 'fuck I do whatever I want' vs 'Fuck, I do whatever I want' .</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In no verse does it suggest demonbane is capable of changing the meta, especially in different multiverses.</br>  <br>There's in-story meta and out-of-story meta</br>  <br> It's just 'fuck I do whatever I want' vs 'Fuck, I do whatever I want' . <br>Pretty much this, characters on the top of the chart is harder to compare since we don't know if their power work on each other.<br>Characters on the lower position however, is easier to compare since they have much simpler power.<br>Ultimately it's about who have the most bullshit about them.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The definition of meta is "outside". You can't be meta while being inside of the story. If that is the case then there are an absolute shit load of characters who are beyond meta by a shit load of levels.<br><br>Lets take Tenchi Muyo. The Chousin in it exist outside of the meta by several levels.<br>The universe is one of about 22 in this universe, the story takes place in the 3rd of these, and outside of these is a hyperverse, the chousin exist in a place outside of this hyperverse. They are essentially 20 metas above the normal.<br><br>So what if a character is "outside of the meta"? These kind of characters are 19 levels above your character. And then you have shit like Kami Tenchi and Demonbane who are AN INFINITE NUMBER above this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Clear Note can literally defeat almost everyone in that chart.  <br>But they're still constrained by fiction. I don't see any Demonbanes or Kami Tenchis in the real world.<br><br>No matter how many levels of meta you are above the setting, there's always an impassible barrier between fiction and reality.</br></br></br>  Is there any anime characters that eat Fried Chicken?  No, it's usually hamburgers. In fact we had a whole thread about anime hamburgers the other day.  Everyone in Japan eats fried chicken during Christmas.    <br> Hamburger <br><br>more like salisburg steak</br></br></br>    <br>Too much YEAST</br>  mio honda  List of pleb tier seiyuu you should be ashamed of for liking:<br><br>1.

They're the easiest part of Japanese to learn and are very difficult to translate without it being awkward</br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br><br> difficult to translate <br>You mean impossible to translate. There is no English equivalent to honorifics. Culture and language have inherent ties, so you can't pull something out of one culture and expect it to naturally fit in another. "Bro" has a vastly different connotation from how translators try to use it in place of onii-chan or aniki, and nobody calls everyone "mister" in English like they do with "-san" in Japan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There may be no english semantemes equivalent to honourifics, but context-specific uses of words like "bro," "sir," "mister," etc. can mean pretty much the same thing depending on their inflection, syntagmatic associations, and accompanying body language.</br>  <br>that being said japanese body language is so different from normal people (american) body language that there is no point trying to translate honourifics.</br>  <br>So just leave the honorifics in.</br>  Why do they do the fucking finger thing to their mouths?  <br>come on guy everyone understands -chan and -kun and the feelings they convey. It adds a more human element to the dialogue.</br>  <br>It's a  monster secret </br>  Every time I see this show all I can think about is that Anon and his thread about her voice.  <br>I think you misread my post. I'm arguing for honorifics in subs. Trying to remove them or replace them with awkward English nontranslations is bad.</br>  <br>Because we have functional ears.</br>  <br>That's his point. Leave -chan and other honorifics in instead of trying to substitute some vague English approximate.</br>  Mikan's VA.  <br>What's the point of omitting them from the subs if you're already listening for them?</br>  <br>Are you serious? Subtitles are not captions. They translations. If it isn't a translation, it doesn't need to be included in the subtitles. This is equivocal to if a character speaks spanish or french, and the subs just kept them as spanish or french-- utterly pointless.</br>  <br><br>yeah my bad</br></br>  <br>Names aren't translated. So, should they be omitted or localised in your anime?</br>  <br>So you're saying that if a character uses Engrish in a sentence, that part should be left blank?</br>  <br> If it isn't a translation, it doesn't need to be included in the subtitles. <br>So all of Commie's memesubs then?</br></br>  <br> equivocal </br>  20 minutes.  What does it take for an anime or manga to be labeled as "edgy".<br><br>Is it simply because violence is present or is there something more to it?</br></br>  <br>It's any anime that has violence and blood that you don't like.</br>  <br>Needless violence,blood and deaths just for the sake of it and to hook teenagers in.<br>But it's not like edgy has any meaning anymore.</br></br>  <br>Anything that has violence and I don't like it = edgy.</br>  WANNA RENEGADE DOWN<br>[untz untz untz]</br>  <br>Any examples that come to mind? Rarely does death occur without reason.<br><br>For argument's sake, let's look at Seraph of the End. In the first episode you have all those kids die. How is it needless if their deaths fueled MC's desire to wipe out the vampires?</br></br></br>  Violence needs a purpose and a reason.<br>Unnecessary acts of violence like breaking someone's neck just for the sake of it is edgy.</br>  <br>Acts of violence for the purpose of establishing a character's personality or setting the general tone of the setting have a purpose, however. I'd say 'edgy' becomes an appropriate description when the author feels the need to continuously and gratuitously remind the audience about how grim and dark the story and characters are.</br>  <br> Any examples that come to mind? Rarely does death occur without reason. <br>Not him, but Akame ga Kill comes to mind. It's a guilty pleasure of mine, but the deaths in Akame ga Kill are only there to show that anyone can die at any moment, and are often needleslly gratuitous. <br><br>And then there's Meet Dog, which had literally zero influence on the rest of the story. Meet Dog may be the edgiest thing I've ever seen, not that I didn't enjoy it.<br><br>Oh wait, there's something even edgier than Meet Dog.... yeah...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if it is done to portray that the character doing it is a nut job without any remorse and needs to be stopped?</br>  For it to have edginess.<br>There doesn't even need to be violence in it for it to be edgy, or for them to even talk about violence.<br>If you don't know what edginess is you should really just fucking pull a Budd Dwyer because nobody who has lived through the 80s, 90s, or early 2000s doesn't not know what edginess is without having first lived through those 30 years at the bottom of the fucking ocean and completely separated from the outside world.</br></br>  honestly, edgy has become a very misused buzzword and now no more than an insult to other series that u dont like.  <br> the deaths in Akame ga Kill are only there to show that anyone can die at any moment <br> needleslly gratuitous <br><br>Not so needless if they are there to show that no one is safe and the world is dangerous. Cannot comment on the "Meet Dog", is it part of the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>damn clown</br>  <br> edgy <br>adjective US /ˈedʒ·i/<br>› nervous or easily upset:<br>He paced the hallway looking edgy and impatient.<br><br>Hmm.<br>I don't get it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cannot comment on the "Meet Dog", is it part of the manga? <br>It is. In case you want spoilers  three little girls who never show up in the series again get raped by a dog. Two of them don't survive it, the third one hires Night Raid to slaughter the gang that organized this dog-rape. By the end of the comic the last remaining girl dies knowing that her two friends are avenged. </br></br>  <br>That does sound pretty gruesome, especially if this "dog" actually decides to do it out of nowhere. If it's just there as an episodic thing, with no real influence in the long run, I don't even know what to say.</br>  <br><br>The handling of death and violence.<br><br>If a character acts like killing people and being violent is cool then he is edgy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Edgy - adj. Something that makes /a/nons feel like they are deep, unique, and bad ass for liking said thing.</br>  <br>That's full-on gore. Edgy is more like Kirito wearing only black clothing and being "The Black Swordsman".</br>  <br>But the things /a/ calls edgy, like, say, the anime in OP's pic, are generally ones people like because they're fun, without feeling deep in the least for liking them. That definition doesn't really work.</br>  <br>That's just you hating on the mental image of someone watching a show. No one says the likes of "for mature people like myself" seriously anymore.</br>  Seems like we have to define what everyone means when he says edgy. <br>I think the very definition of edgy is basically found in this picture and it should serve as basic outline of what edgy is.</br>  <br>Edgy just seemed like a 'le meme' fags way of saying Emo shit</br>  <br>Wow you'the so edgy</br>  <br>bio: tatsumi was born with a special power. he was stronger than all his classmates in the empire fighting academy. he served in the empire military fighting night raid and in the final battel against night raid they were fighting and night raid turned him to the darkness and tatsumi turned against aria and killed her. he lost part of his eye in that battle which is why it looks like that, pls stop PMing me askin me why that's why. also his smile isnt innocent fuck you esdeath everyone knos ur a fuckin asspull scammer fagot.<br><br>likes: hurtin people, bein badass, motorcycles, nine inch nails (the band), killing, death, punk rock, jinco jeans, skulls, darkness, hot gurls who are sluts with small boobies, nine inch nails (on foot), evil smiles, red (cool kind not akame kind)<br><br>dislikse: niceness, happiness, levis, dr. stylish from the jaegers fuck you stylish stop showing evryone my fuckin secret hideout you peace of shit, trent razner, short nails, esdeath (megga ass-faggot), sunshine, life, my dad, football<br><br>@blood_armor_boi84</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hitler nailed it.</br>  <br> blood_skull_boi84 <br><br>Does that mean the guy who made this is 31?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Example: "I'm an edgy faggot."</br></br></br>     "edgy" is an insult <br>HAHAHA SINCE WHEN<br>I love edgy things. They're entertaining. Edginess is an ideal.</br></br>    <br>People enjoying hurting/abusing/killing others. Also gratuitous depictions of violent acts.</br>  The way /a/ uses edgy is when the portrayal of such violence is not only shallow, but also glorified for a coolness factor in a way that appeals to teenagers who think they're the shit for watching it.<br><br>However, the actual definition of edgy doesn't really have to be negative. It literally just means pushing boundaries.</br></br>  <br>What did you think of Gangsta's first episode?</br>  <br>It's edgy if it's not moeshit</br>  <br>I never watched it simply because I didn't think it would appeal to me.</br>  <br>This.</br>  So from what I gather:<br><br>A show is edgy if it treats violence and death superficially.<br><br>A person is edgy if he is autistic enough to find a cool factor in violence and death done with or without a reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, this guy is right </br>  <br>Now that post's what I'd call edgy</br>  <br>Only one of them gets raped by the dog.<br><br>I think one has her legs broken and the other has her eyes gouged out.</br></br></br>  <br> A show is edgy if it treats violence and death superficially. <br>It has a lot to do with how it is portrayed. Any silly action movie could meet that definition, but they're not all "edgy". I would consider the weight important. An important part of "edgy" is about trying to make the viewer take it seriously even when it is entirely superficial.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Kirito has Asperger's syndrome so you can put him in the second catergory.</br>  You just need an autistic faggot (everyone in /a/) to hate a show for it to be labeled as edgy.  <br>To me, it's excessive violence, brooding, and or gore that has no purpose other than to make a character look cool or for shock value. Bonus points if it's all done like it's no big deal. Not as much if the scene actually has weight.</br>  <br> "edgy" is about trying to make the viewer take it seriously even when it is entirely superficial <br><br>Never seen it put like this. If a bomb goes, kills some background bystanders and the show is trying to emphasize the loss, it's edgy?</br></br></br>  <br>The important point is that it is superficial. Showing the consequences of actions in realistic manner is not what I would consider superficial and thus not edgy.<br><br>I'm just trying to grasp at what makes a silly action movie different than something actually edgy, because that guy's definition doesn't address it.</br></br></br>  <br>If an action movie would to be turned into an anime, it would be called edgy. <br><br>Take the fight at the end of Man of Steel, where the city is in ruin and probably a lot of people died. Death was treated superficially in order to show the fight.</br></br></br>  <br> Bomb goes off in the background <br><br>A. The explosion is "cartoony" and looks wacky<br>Comedy<br><br>B. The aftermath of the explosion is shown and you see lots of gore<br>Simple Gore , maybe even a "anti-war" scene<br><br>C.Same as B but the show mocks the scene, the character which set the bomb off or has seen the explosion makes dumb jokes or says something "edgy" in order to look cool<br>Edgy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would it really, though? It's all about portrayal. If the movie was simply ignorant of the suffering it is simply a dumb movie, not an edgy one. If the movie reflects on the destructive nature of their fight in a solemn manner, it is not edgy. If the movie acknowledges the suffering and doesn't give a fuck as long as the characters looked cool doing it, then it's edgy.</br>  <br> C <br><br>I can imagine that happening when portraying an antagonist in order to show he is not quite right in the head and needs to be stopped? In any other instance ...</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone can agree to that.</br>  I define edgy as needless or excessive angst and/or violence. Of course, the bar for needless or excessive changes depending on the series.<br><br>It's really that simple.</br></br>  <br>Yes but even then you have multiple ways of portraying that reaction.<br><br>A. "Pssshh...nothing personal kid."<br>B. "They are human vermin and they deserved it."<br>C. "Blowing people up is fun."<br><br>D. "It had to be done."<br>E. "One day you will understand."<br>F. "Its for a greater good."<br><br>Notice how A-C are "edgy" and D-F arent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If the movie acknowledges the suffering and doesn't give a fuck as long as the characters looked cool doing it, then it's edgy. <br><br>Yeah, kind of that.<br><br>If a movie tries to present you something violent as cool, with no deeper meaning, purpose or reason, simply to sell you a character as cool for being what any sane person may call a psychopath... I would call that edgy.<br><br>Case in point:<br><br><br>You can´t sell me a character as a pure-hearted hero when he does shit like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because D-F don't sound like something a literally insane person might say. They sound like a rational man justifying something to himself. Why do characters gotta self justify so bad?</br>  <br> People die like trash </br>  <br>Ask the writers of edgy animes.<br><br>You can have the same scene in edgy and in normal. Its not about the action but about how characters handle it.</br></br></br>  <br>A literally insane person wouldn't say A-C. More like, "I did it because Jesus told me to!"</br>  <br>Having a villain do terrible things for the sake of doing terrible things is usually poor writing regardless. If you must have a completely insane person, it would be more about how the show itself treats them more than anything. Is the character glorified, or does the environment around him like opposing characters or tone of the overall work make it clear that he's not a cool guy at all?</br>  <br>This post was pretty edgy</br>  <br>One that is obviously aimed at teenagers like the one in your pic automatically should be labeled edgy.<br><br> english title <br> super powers <br> caucasian and caucasoid characters <br> dystopia <br><br>Automatic edgy chuniishit label applied.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If a bomb goes, kills some background bystanders and the show is trying to emphasize the loss, it's edgy? <br>If it's emphasizing the loss then it's possibly attempting to show the horrors of war and conflict, or the impact that things like war have on ordinary people.<br><br>For an example of a genuinely edgy bomb sequence, see the opening cutscene to Modern Warfare 3.</br></br></br></br>  Edgy is what happens when an author writes a script with darkness as the main motif without any substance to back it up and is handled. It's designed to cater towards angsty teens that seem to think darkness and gore are cool, usually mixing them with other tonally different lowest common denominator tropes.<br>It's darkness for the sake of darkness and not for the sake of plot or characterization, it's when it tries really hard to appear "dark" through contrived and ineffective tragedy, violence, or evil that it becomes laughable.<br>Unless they are old OVAs with lots of great sakuga, they're utterly worthless.<br><br>Common examples:<br><br>Edgy anime:<br> elfen lied <br> mirai nikki <br> akame ga kiru <br> chaos dragon (probably) <br><br>Dark anime:<br> berserk <br> jin-roh <br> shinsekai yori <br> gakkou gurashi (probably) <br><br>tl;dr <br>complete shit shows that only teens bring up because of babby's first (bad) series with blood</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=887<wbr>WIB1oRAA</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>You're so clever :) and funny ;)</br></br>  <br>nowadays you can't even be sure that's b8 anymore</br>  I'd call Sasuke an Edgy character.  <br> opening cutscene to Modern Warfare 3. <br/></br>  <br>violence for the sake of violence.<br><br>violence or dialogue with the purpose of shock value, but is completely unnecessary.<br><br>violence without emotion or consequence.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daria had it right 15 years ago.<br>And the Japs are behind a decade or two as always.<br><br>I'll go back to what I said:<br> english title <br>Gangsta - the japs can speak fluent dictionary English so shit like Berserk and Bastard can't cut it anymore in contrast Gangsta which is a noneword is still new and fresh for them andclicks with the niggerfied youth of both the West and the East.<br><br> super powers <br>All kids dream about being God.

It used excessive amounts of fairly generic violence to force down our throats every sad background for every character. It's boring and only shows that the author doesn't know how to get his audience to empathise with his characters other than the universal sense of sympathy for those who suffer.</br>  <br>Chuuni doesn't make it edgy<br>The only real edgy part of it is the "I'm a half-vampire vampire hunter" part</br></br>  <br> the part with killing whoever he likes is not edgy </br>  <br> implying that's a bad thing </br>  <br> jin-roh <br> Dark anime <br>It's not dark at all. Sure, the colour palette may be dark but there's nothing dark about the story at all.</br></br></br>  <br> using characters riiiiiiiiiiiiiight on the edge of being out of school <br>I haven't read the manga, but the main characters in Gangsta are both in their mid to late 20s by their physical appearances</br></br>  <br>This comment is probably the reason word "edge" exist. <br><br>Theme-wise Jin Roh is pretty bleak, in its core is a story about political corruption in a pretty hopeless world. Most importantly it is about the psyche of a man that is used as a tool, even questioning his humanity. It's straight up social commentary and if you read it like this, it's unbelievably dark and hopeless story, with one of the biggest downer endings.<br><br>But because it doesn't have tons of blood and people cursing for their terrible fate in midst of the machine, you don't see it as dark. This is why "edge" exists, because works that are subtle are not noticed and you have to rub the bleakness in the face of the viewer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't have an idea what world "dystopia" means, do you?</br>  <br>Think about some weaboo autist. Now imagine them describing the anime. If they refer to it as "gritty" or "Anyone could die so it's realistic", it's probably edgy.</br>  <br>Rather, I'd say that if it was the leading descriptor and reason you should watch it is "it's so dark"<br>Bonus edge points if they call it "metal"</br></br>  <br>But Dorohedoro is metal, and it's not edgy</br>  <br>Those are true tho. <br><br>They live in a world like that, retarded would be if any of them died. <br><br>And you know that in real life people don't have 3 arcs of badassery before they die or something right? In AgK you die when it's your turn and that's it. It's not edgy, it's just the world they live in and the fucking fact that they're assassins. <br><br>I think they say it in like ep 1</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's retarded. <br><br>Guts is edgy as fuck too then.</br></br></br>  <br>It'd be easier to agree with you if it were just the assassins and villains f the week, but the giant pointless torture dungeon, Meet Dog, clown rape, etc. kinda throw a wrench into your view</br>  <br>Edgy = "Dark" thing I don't like (SnK)<br><br>Not Edgy = "Dark" thing I like (Berserk)</br></br></br>  <br> How is it needless if their deaths fueled MC's desire to wipe out the vampires? <br>Killing the MC's wife/daughter/brother/sister/best friend to fuel the MC's motivation is easy and usually looked down upon as cheap, unimaginative writing. It's both overdone and boring.<br>"Edgy" isn't about needless blood so much as "cheap" blood, cheap lives.</br></br></br>  <br>That is just a subjective interpretation of a sperg lord and does not necessarily mean that the show itself has to be edgy. <br><br>But even so, who wants to be associated with the likes of someone like that? So instead of just calling the person edgy, we also call the show.</br></br></br>  <br>I enjoyed Deadman Wonderland and it was edgy as fuck<br> I also have an albino fetish, so that might have something to do with it </br></br>  <br>About the clown, just check albert fisher. He's not edgy, just crazy as fuck. Pedophile killers can exist anywhere. <br><br>Torture dungeon, it happened in real life. It was common back in time and don't say it wasn't because you know it was. All the torture devices that existed before human rights kicked in. AgK happens in a time similar to middle ages so it makes sense. <br><br>All the ones that did those things are crazy fucks and the story tells you several time they're crazy fucks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Edginess is more related to tone than it is to content.<br><br>As a rule of thumb, I regard something as edgy if it's tonally dark and also juvenile.<br><br>Darkness is not tantamount to edginess. Darkness encroaches on edginess when it's not tempered with maturity.<br><br>For instance, I doubt anyone here would call Texhnolyze an "edgy" show despite the fact that it's one of the tonally darkest animes ever made. <br><br>Similarly, I would hesitate to call Black Lagoon edgy. It's self-aware of its own absurdity and actually handles its dark undertones with surprising maturity when it comes to the character drama.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The torture dungeon is one of my biggest annoyances with the series because it has no reason to exist, other than to show how comically evil the nobility was.<br><br>Give me even one reason why it was there<br> to keep the citizens in line <br>The common person didn't even know it existed; they just knew that dissenters would sometimes disappear.<br> to extract information <br>Not only did Regent Evilface scarcely even acknowledge the revolution in works, no information taking is ever shown. It's just a bunch of naked peasants shown walking en masse towards giant pots of boiling oil or something equally dumb. Fuck, even Berserk had it's giant evil torture dungeon show the torturers actually try to get something out of it's prisoners; that's a real example of an Inquisition-style setting<br><br>I'm hard-pressed to even think of a third genuine example of why it would have existed. it's in the same vein as the caricaturized faced used when someone does something super evil.<br><br>tl;dr it's poor writing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Raping and murdering a dead man's wife and child on his grave for no reason other than shock value is the very definition of 'edgy".</br>  <br>It's there to show Esdeath is crazy. She burried like 40000 people alive. <br><br>It's there to show she's a bad person. It's there to show she shouldn't be trusted (not that it matters to waifufags). <br><br><br>The point it's trying to make is to show she's insane. No need to dwell on it more than necessary. She enjoys doing that shit and there are people within the empire that enjoy it too. In real life those people exist by the way</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for no reason <br><br>Maybe because they were raping and murdering everyone else and nobody stopped them? Why would they NOT rape and murder Borg's family if they were doing the same to everyone they wanted?</br></br></br>  <br>If you need a giant torture dungeon gruesomely slaughtering thousands of people simply because 'she's crazy and she likes it' and no real practical reason,<br>I think you've got exactly the kind of edgy people are complaining about</br></br>  I think in many people in this thread who classify edgy as "needless violence" are on the right track, but I think the problems come once you try to portray clinically insane person. If the point of the series is that person is "insane", is it unconditionally edgy?<br><br>I don't think shit like akame ga kill really counts, as the insanity is somehow mixed with comedy that makes it stand out unecessarily</br></br>  <br>Rape clown was absurd and edgy as fuck. I mean not when he raped random kids and shit but what he did to Bols family. They were literally on the same side, even if ashura was PMs son and had a lot of clout to cover shit up, if esdeath or jobking had known what ashura and the clown did to a fallen soldiers family, especially one as prominent as Bols who was clearly part of that worlds fucking navy seal french rangers legion military unit they would have them all executed.<br><br>No clown, no matter how inclined he was towards rape would risk that, especially when it out was out in the open, on a clear day. And it wasn't even dark outside yet. Yes I'm still fucking mad, I'm glad that glorious winged faggot incinerated his ass.</br></br></br>  <br> Crazy people need a reason to do crazy things <br><br>Mozgus in Berserk was insane, he was just convincing himself he was doing it for some greater good, doesn't change the fact that he did it because he was crazy. <br>He was edgy as fuck yet somehow it's acceptable? Double standard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> comedy <br>Akame ga Kill isn't a comedy, it's just funny. There's an enormous difference there.</br></br>  <br> he was doing it for some greater good <br> he did it because he was crazy <br>See? He was crazy, but doing it for a purpose other than being crazy</br></br></br>  <br>Fun fact: the only reason anyone mentions those is because of a psycho bitch in it, otherwise they'd be treated as the total garbage they are like Pupa or Mars of Destruction<br>Also<br> akame ga shit underage brigade has arrived </br></br></br>  <br>the moest whore</br>  <br>But you yourself just admitted Mozgus had a reason. He was trying to find heretics, blah blah doesn't really matter.<br>The difference lies there, because Esdese had no reason other than to kill people. That's why people are calling it edgy</br></br>  <br>Well I'm glad angel-san rekt him too but your point doesn't make sense.<br><br>Like I said, they were doing everything they wanted. They were raping everyone they wanted. <br>He was with the son of the dude that COMMANDS the entire empire, if the son of that dude has your back then everything's OK. <br>Also do I need to repeat the fact that clown was some crazy fuck? A crazy fuck with powerful people covering his ass. It's fucking perfect</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the modern world, you can view and enjoy all the violence and gorey B list movies as you like.<br><br>For them, they can only get their dose through actual victims.<br>Pedo clown = medieval moefag all along</br></br></br></br>   he was just CONVINCING himself he was doing it for some greater good <br><br>Schizo's think they're killing gantz aliens when they kill people. Doesn't change the fact they do it because they're batshit insane</br></br>  <br><br>Meant to reply to<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Different guy here, but it's poor writing. The author goes "hmm, I need to show this character is crazy and not a good guy" to the most retarded uninspired over the top way to do it.<br><br><br>What? No. He wasn't right in the head but you can't boil down the entire character to "because he was crazy".</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say the series was "comedy". I said insanity was mixed with the comedy. Can you really claim akame had no intention of being comedic?</br>  <br>Izaya is Edgy. <br><br>But I like him so I don't care.</br></br></br>  <br>He means that within the context of the show Esdeath and Budou are seen as the strongest, and by defying them through killing a comrades family you are putting yourself at a massive fucking risk. Granted Esdeath wasn't even there at the time and who the fuck knows what Budou does. Also PM practically hated his son, so I'm sure if someone had killed his ass he wouldn't have lost sleep over it.<br>inb4<br> budou <br> strongest <br>Yeah I know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you cannot really hate his edginess as it's played partly for laughs and the series is very self-aware of it.</br>    <br>We're trying to have actual discussions here, go away.</br>  <br> Schizo's think they're killing gantz aliens when they kill people. <br>Again, a reason.<br>Insanity does not mean chaos and evil, writing an insane character like this is poor writing, to me. The insane think they're normal, they see, hear, or believe things that make them justify what they do brought on by past experiences. <br><br>It's not just "I like killing people because I'm evil", that's just a shitty character</br></br></br></br></br>  This is from the extra Chapter 23.5 from Akame ga Kill.<br><br>A group of individuals from the capital get their kicks from seeing girls suffer. Do you:<br><br>a. Think that because it has no real influence on the main story and they way it is presented, it is edgy.<br><br>b. Think that it shows how twisted that world is and why Night Raid is needed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And crazy people don't act the same, are you dumb?. <br><br>You're trying to think why a CRAZY person would do something evil or not, there's a reason they're fucking crazy, if it was that easy understanding crazy fuckers then i'm sure a lot of people would have great lifes.</br></br></br>  <br>We already knew they were irredeemably evil because of their previous rapes and murders. It doesn't matter whether or not Wild Hunt knew who they were, it was put in because the audience knew. If you can't see why some fat clown fucking Bols' precious daughter on top of his grave isn't edgy then I don't know what else to say.</br>  <br>You do know rich people in god forsaken (and not so forsaken) countries do shit to plebs all the time right?<br><br>In africa all sorts of shit happen for example. In India poorfags sell they children so that rich family's can hunt them. <br><br>Now go back to the middle ages where poor people mattered even less than they do now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, not all of the insane act the same, there are different psychosis and such, people react to things differently, but there's always a reason for their behavior. <br>If you can't write Crazy beyond "They're crazy so they like killing people" just write them as "Evil for evil's sake" and drop the whole insane part</br></br>  <br>It's not an A or B situation;<br>it can arguably have an impact on how we see why Night raid needs to do what they do, but that doesn't mean the way it's presented isn't 'edgy'</br></br>  <br>He is.</br>  <br>It's presented as edgy. There is enough content already within the context of the manga to understand why Night Raid is needed. It isn't necessary. <br><br>Though I do think slightly higher of the author if his intention was actually to show the world that bestiality x loli is godlike and is one of his fetishes.</br></br></br>  <br>The thumbnail made it look like she had swollen lips and bloody nose, while smiling.</br>  <br>I agree with you. Also, that is a sound speculation considering it's an extra chapter out of nowhere.</br>  <br>It's certainly not Gangsta that is edgy<br>Edgy is more about introducing a whole new classroom of characters just for the sake of killing them all in the following episode</br></br>  Why are these people defending Akame ga Kill?<br>The writing is atrocious and "edgy". Killing off people and having an insane person every other character does not make for good world building.<br><br><br>There is a fine line between showing something to make the viewer hate the main villain for their deeds and having edgy shock value to your manga to generate interest.<br><br>Is this relevant to the stories surrounding the main cast of characters in any way? Is it foreshadowing? Or is it just a dog raping a girl because "woah! that's fucked up man! I sure hate those nobles I've seen do similar stuff dozens of times already, better keep reinforcing that message!"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one was saying it had good world building you fuck. The original argument was someone saying that rape clown wasn't edgy and the people "defending" it were saying he's full of shit and why.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4911067  <br>Like it was already said, people like to call anything they don't like "edgy".<br><br>I know there are some anons on /a/ who think that Terra Formars is somehow edgy.</br></br></br>  <br> Rarely does death occur without reason <br>Yeah right. Look at horseshit like Blood C and Elfed Lied, edgy deaths made quick to grab the spotlight</br></br>  <br>Blood-C was made specifically to portray gruesome deaths with good animation. Just take it for what it is: entertainment. Since forever people have been drawn towards violence and have had a fascination for death. If you want something else, watch Blood+</br>  <br>Bullshit. Blood-C has retarded violence and nothing much else. It's like they took Blood+ and removed everything except for vampires and the violence. And then boost the killing times by a hundred while diversifying the enemies themselves.</br>  You should be able to solve this.  <br>For some reason I liked the manga FAR better despite being ridiculous and riddled with cliches. Maybe it was the art and pacing or whatever but this anime does it no justice, and kills off whatever small life it had to begin with.</br>  <br>I'm not a bum so I wouldn't know</br>  Any armchair scientists want to give their two cents worth on the most likely explanation for the Fermi Paradox? Basically, the Drake equation lines out how many alien civilizations would have tried to send out communications that we could detect, and the corresponding Fermi estimate would approximate exactly how many we should have received thus far. In reality though, we know of none, so why not? Are they too far away, are they intentionally avoiding us, do we not have the right listening tools, what?<br><br>My theory is that at some point or another, any sentient species will inevitably eradicate itself by fault (or design?) of its own sentience.
