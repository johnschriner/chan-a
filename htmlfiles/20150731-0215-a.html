[ Which universe do you prefer anons? The old 1-6 or the new 7-8+? <br><br>Also, now that Jojolion has been going for a while do you think we'll get some EoH characters/situations? Surely there's enough content there now. <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br></br>  Posted in the last thread. Araki interview from Viz's release of PB v3.  <br> They actually kept the "Speedwagon cooley withdrawers" line.  <br><br>I'm glad but some other lines they translated rub me the wrong way. Just too used to Ignition One's</br></br></br>  First for Shitty Crossovers  <br>The problem with the characters is that not a lot of them were really combat oriented, or traditional fighting.<br>Only one besides Josuke that could be in the game is maybe the first rock person.</br></br>  <br>Bit hard to compare them since SBR-verse only has one complete part so far. But if it manages to keep up this level of quality ill probably end up prefering the SBR-verze.</br>  I'd like to see Araki do a proper SoL with no fighting and maybe some relationship drama. Or maybe even a noir murder mystery with minimal action.  <br>everyone will still end up getting stands, except instead of the arrow or the morioh ruins in part 8 it's finding true love or having sex in a really oddly specific position</br>  <br> finding true love or having sex in a really oddly specific position <br>I'm sure Araki will have the time of his life drawing that.</br></br>  So was it Jesus or the spin that allowed Johny to walk again?  Lets play spot the difference!<br><br>Spot the difference between regular Gio and genderswapped Gio!</br></br>  <br>I still think Tsurugi and Yasuho have a chance. Paisley park can give you a choice like 「Banana Peel」 or 「Fire Hydrant」 in 3... 2... 1... Tsurugi can do the thing where he makes someone look like someone else and get the opposing team to attack each other, or even make a stage hazard look like himself, so when they try attack it, BAM, Tsurugi bus! It's not much of a stretch to give them a couple of basic attacks, like a couple of slaps or something. You could have a swarm of oragami frogs or an oragami mecha, idk.</br>  <br>It's called Part 4: Filler is Unmakeable</br>  Anyone have a picture of Jobin licking Pucci's eyeball? That'd be pretty gay.  <br>Oooooh, I got it! THERE ISN'T!</br>  <br>Bigger eyes<br>Bigger lips<br>Boobs</br></br></br>  Has there been a more pure and innocent soul in the existence of anime?  I bet she pleasures herself with tentacles.  <br>I'd be fine with that, so long as she was doing it for the Tentacles sake</br>  I'd rather the qt shota to br honest  <br>only if you're shipping him with the cake Herbalist</br>  Shiragami a cute!  <br>I m-mean Shirayuki!</br>  Why do I like her so much?  <br>Cake herbalist has a childhood friend/fellow herbalist she'll end up with in an ideal world.</br>  <br> implying she doesn't drug men at the local tavern and take them back to her place for a little torture sex </br>    shojo shit you a faggot  <br>Yeah shojo is shitty in general, josei is where it's at bruh</br>  Why is that girls are "pure and innocent" and boys are "dense faggot"?  Shirayuki is someone that you just want to support and see her give her best, she's a geniunely likeable character.  Not saying I like her more than Shirayuki, but Sawako is so pure and innocent it crosses the line and actually makes her seem mentally disabled.  <br>pls do not sexualize shirayuki. She is pure.<br><br><br> shojo shit <br>Here's your reply<br><br><br>What's wrong with liking both? Though I will admit, the josei demographic has some of my favorite anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean jojo shit.</br>  <br>Because the virginity of little boys is not a highly prized commodity, unlike little grills. Not even other dense faggots like dense faggots.</br>  <br>I myself prefer slutty tomboys though.</br>  <br>I was joking, actually everything is mostly shit.<br>I do like both, in addition to everything else. Whatever's good, is good.<br><br>Good things are good.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, of course there has, why would you think otherwise?<br><br>Especially since gingers have no souls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither do retards.</br>  <br><br>Only if they're Japanese, and...oh shit.</br></br>  Android version has been released.

Can't say I expected her in this game..  <br>ミノタウロス, so yes. It says his real name was relatively obscure, but he was widely known as the bull of Minos, Minotaur.</br>  <br>Holy shit</br>  <br> hay guys, new manchild games, lets play :D </br>  <br>Alasha, Alyasha or something along those lines.</br>  <br><br>So I'm at least expecting a Rin or Illya in japanese themed outfit?</br></br>  <br> professional mage Sakura <br>dick status = muh</br></br>  <br>Caster is Mephistopheles.

Sorry.</br>  <br> those stats </br>  <br>Damn, that is some pretty fucking impressive fluid druidry.</br>    <br> Alyasha <br><br>''Alasha is one of the most powerful and the oldest of the Kazakh tribes.[citation needed] Alasha is a member of the Bai-Uly (Rich Son) tribe confederation, which is a part of Kishi Zhuz (Little Hundred).

In 1897, members of the Bai-Uly tribe confederation numbered 600,000, or 16.2% of all Kazakhs.''<br><br>Urgh, ok?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They joined the arm thingy club.</br></br>  <br>She was stripper IRL.

You are guaranteed to get a shitty 3-star servant.  <br>some translated this before</br>   Rider <br> in what would practically be a bikini </br>  <br>I was just going to ask the same.</br>  It's a mobage. If it exists already, you can bet your ass they'll add the servant in at some point.  Now that the race is over what's keeping you form dropping this einterly?<br><br>Im still only reading this to see if there are more middle age magic girl adventures</br></br>  I dropped Yamada after chapter 90, worth it.  <br>Wait, you were reading this for the romance?</br>  <br>No im reading this because im addicted to gambling and the horse that i put all my money on just got shot down in broad daylight. <br><br> i just wanna win once </br></br></br>  The race isn't over because we all know that   alium   is going to win.  I dropped this a long time ago.  <br>I still read this for sexy Grandumber, Durriken, Karen, Dumon, and of course Densei</br>  <br>If you were only reading this to see who "won" you would have dropped it ages ago because there wasn't any doubt at any point who he was choosing. <br><br>Anyway looking at the raws, they seem to have generated enough material to keep things going for another 35 chapters, at least. The stuff with Shima and the substitute teacher should be worth waiting for, at least.</br></br></br>  <br> watching a harem because you're rooting for a girl to win when the main girl is identified in the first chapter <br>how far in denial do you have to be to do this</br></br>  <br> The race isn't over <br>What in the world makes you think the race is not over?<br>Have you ever read any manga where they just undo the coupling. You might have but it sure wasn't harem shit <br><br>The author will have to pull out some heavy deus ex machena shit to make that even remotely do able</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> actually liking plot dives the character <br>when MC can't even fug it what's the point?</br></br>  <br>I can think of some ways they might break the two of them up, but I can't think of any way that Kuromine just sort of gives up and goes after someone else. Who would even want to see that.</br>  <br>Not every harem is first girl bullshit.</br>  <br> how far in denial do you have to be to do this <br> Maiken is literally thowing herself at his dick  <br> she is the childhood friend <br>I don't know man seems like there was hope at some point</br></br></br></br>  <br>i would <br>let it fucking burn</br></br>  Our redrawers are back. Expect a new chapter this weekend.  <br>well its funny. It genuinely makes me laugh at times. No matter who wins they all had a good time together and gave me a good time reading unlike nisekoi.</br>  <br> Have you ever read any manga where they just undo the coupling <br>SEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOO<br><br>Also, Rotte no Omocha, though I guess that couple wasn't firmly established. <br><br>And Zettai Karen Children, because  the girl gets dissected and turned into a human weapon. <br><br>As well as  Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles and xxxHoLiC  though only the second one is a harem and the breakups are due to time and space.<br><br>White Album counts too, right? <br><br>And don't let yourself forget the fake romance light novel with Silver, Mikan, and Pink, or Haganai where Sena suddenly and immediately lost to Rika and then Yuki.<br><br>Also, pic-related. Fucking homewrecker.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually cannot think of any way to break the two of them up, only ways to create menage e trois or harem ending.</br>  <br>Theoretically her parents could split the two of them up somehow, although this would require the mom to oppose their relationship or their dad to stop being moe for five minutes and do something. Even that would obviously be temporary. They're just too good a couple to bust up so he can get with the pervert or the alien (who's also a pervert) or something.</br>  <br>The thumbnail makes it sort of look like he has a gigantic cock if you aren't paying much attention.</br>  I really want Aizawa's mother to intervene and take her off of Earth for her own sake, so that her heart doesn't break anymore.

The romance was just an extra and in the end a pleasant surprise.</br>  <br> Now that the race is over </br>  <br>what's this thing in the background?</br>  Next chapter when?  <br>Read the manga.</br>  Thanks for reminding me what I was forgetting to continue watching but most likely not bother with  <br>It isn't. <br><br>According to the box girl, Asahi isn't the one to marry Dumpire</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off you and your shittast</br>  <br>Do you really think that other one than Dumpire will win?</br>  It's not over until she drinks his blood in an overly lewd manner with explicit symptoms of sexual arousal.  <br>This anon gets it right.</br>  <br>It will happen.</br>  <br>To see the rest of the other characters shown in RAWs and Shima raping dudes pretending to be girls</br>    where is dumpire's cleavage in the anime?  <br>Is there, but we cannot see it until they told us it exists.</br>  <br> &gt;Ever putting money on anyone after the first girl <br> Fuuka </br></br>  <br>Seo doesn't count.</br>  <br>2 more chapters until "that".

The guy is a Hakomarifag and would probably make some good fanart.</br>   Bang, Bang!   <br>He might not have been even the least bit aware that people have been translating the series.</br>  <br> wanting anime to ruin it <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>Reading is for nerds.</br>  <br>There's no way they could make a good adaptation out of it.</br>  <br> LN shit <br> Anime never <br><br>An anime will almost definitely show up.<br> You're everything that's wrong with the indusrty. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anime never <br><br>Please, be it never forever.</br></br></br>  <br> An anime will almost definitely show up. <br>Kinda doubt that. I mean the series is completed and it was never popular to begin with. Even if it was adapted, chances are it would be extensively rewritten or censored.</br></br>  It felt short and defeating O was strange. Otherwise it was pretty good.  <br>Apparently it was the longest volume yet, according to Eusth. I agree that it felt shorter than the preceding volumes, though. O's defeat was okay to me, I like how it went down, it felt like a logical conclusion the way Maria's box was ultimately self-defeating.</br>  I wanna fuck Kazombie in the ass.  I want to fuck Mogi until she can walk again  I want to fuck Kokone in front of Daiya.  <br><br><br> having all this shit taste <br> not wanting to fuck Maria's box in front of her eyes </br></br></br></br>  <br>More Info please ?

The art sucks, though.</br>   waifufagging so hard you become a perpetual motion device <br>Righteous.</br>  <br>How do you say you love her if you can't repeat the same motion for 700 years for her?</br>  <br>Truly, Kazuki is what all waifufags should aspire to be like. How can you say you love her if you can't even commit mass murder for her?</br>  <br>Because, in the words of Kazuki himself, "…Man, it's surprisingly hard to engage in mass murder."</br>  <br>Yeah, i saw that too. ~300 words is the normal while the last volume was ~360 words. I know light novels are supposed to be short but 60 words don't feel too different.</br>  Do they fuck?  <br>60 pages, anon.</br>  <br>No. Confirmed for cuddling together in bed, though.</br>  <br>Mogi's new design was so good</br>  <br> Confirmed for cuddling together in bed <br>Fuck yeah</br></br>  <br>And  hand holding. </br>  <br>Oh. I'm fucking retarded.</br>  <br>garbage for underages</br>  Why was Onee-chan such a cunt?  epub where?  I keep listening to the OP and ED. It's become a problem, I have an essay to write.<br><br>https://soundcloud.com/replicalette<wbr>r/awuc5mk4ersl<br>https://soundcloud.com/replicalette<wbr>r/sx1svhx1i20c</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Messed up family situation.</br>  <br> finished LN <br> getting an anime <br>Just like Ben-to amirite</br></br></br>   What is this? Maybe it's actually good, let's read the synopsis <br> Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria, or The Empty Box and The Zeroth Maria, tells the story of Kazuki Hoshino, who is almost madly attached to his everyday life <br> A completely ordinary high school student <br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br>She was in despair. Must be hard to see that happen to your beloved otouto</br>  <br> What is this <br>Opinion discarded.</br></br>  <br>The OP was pretty meh. The ED have some charms, especially the "kurikaeshi-kurikaeshi-kurikaeshi" parts.</br>  <br>into the trash it goes, your opinion that is</br>  <br>Hell yeah.<br><br> cripple idol Mogi never </br></br></br>   14,888th time <br> "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah" </br>  <br> Kazuki wakes up and sees his friends being happy <br> What the bleeding fuck is wrong with you people? </br></br>  I mean, what could be more wonderful than experiencing mutual love for all eternity?<br>Nothing. Absolutely nothing.<br>"Haha"<br>I'm happy.<br>"Hahahahahaha"<br>"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha"<br>And thus, my long, long fight finally came to an end.<br><br> &gt;If only that were true. <br><br> I just like, fuck it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder how many times he bang that in the loop</br></br>  <br>Not enough times to stop him from wanting to bang Maria.</br>  <br>Never. The confession was as far as he ever got. And anytime he became aware of the loop he'd start on trying to break out.</br>  <br>You mean Mogi, or the wall? In Mogi's case, not even once. The loop cut off before it could go anywhere.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I'm sure one time in that loop Kazuki did this on Mogi<br><br> —Bang, bang! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why do westerners suck at anime art?</br>  <br>In the end did aya or the wall got pregnant from all that banging?</br>  <br>He mindbroke both the wall and Aya.</br>  <br>I think it's pretty good</br>  <br>I wish someone can translate OP and ED so I can understand the lyrics. Eus</br>  The ending wasn't perfect, but it was pretty good nonetheless.<br>It was a happy ending overall with no cop outs, although i was hopping for more psyco Kazuki rather than zombie Kazuki.</br>  I feel bad for Kazuki. It didn't seem like he was around in either Daiya's or Yanagi's dream worlds. It's like their perfect lives have no place for him.  <br>Why do you want a crazy lunatic in your dream world?</br>  <br> You're everything that's wrong with the industry. <br>What's wrong?<br><br>The execution is what's matter, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Madly" is the key word here.</br>  So could Aya actually predict the future or was the flashback distorted and she was a normal human (albeit sharp and manipulating) with Maria's brain reinterpreting events and utterances?  <br> anime never <br>And it better stay that way.</br></br>  <br>Seems to me like she was just very manipulative.</br>  <br>I think it's the latter. but I don't think she's a 'normal' human though</br>  When does the series start up again? Will Gattsu get a happy ending?   Will Gattsu get a happy ending? <br>Yes.  And then Theresia appears out of nowhere and kills him. </br>  Look at this shit. Kek  What the fuck. Mr skeltak just showed up to save rickert's life. Also what the fuck was the count in monstermode doing in the forest shouldn't he be on his castle?  <br> EclipseAssassin </br>  <br>Man I will fucking kill myself if he doesn't get a happy ending.<br>How much you want to bet Caska will get her memory and go back being Griffith's bitch.<br>Berserk is the longest NTR story of all the times.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Guts <br> happy ending </br></br></br>    <br>Alright, where'd the Slan and Casca one go on the body?</br>  <br>I was expecting this. It's my internet name from back in the day. I just stuck with it because I'm too unimaginative to think of any thing else.</br>  <br><br> not -=xXxSephiroth777xXx=- <br><br>shit name brah</br></br></br></br>  <br> MIURA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </br>  <br> getting a manga scene tattooed on your body </br>  So are the Vandimion Jews like Rothschild? Were Machiavellian people Jews?  is that there "kid"? i cant remember what his deal was.  <br>That page in the OP was supposed to imply it I think.<br><br>That Beheilt(sp?) shaped Apostle that birthed Griffith, before it went on to actually do that, it consumed that creepy fetus thing that had been appearing to Guts a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>There are no Jews in Berserk you fucking idiot.</br>  <br>Looks like shit</br>  <br>OP I'm pretty sure you haven't been paying attention these last few years.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they ran into one during the troll cave extermination where Gatts runs into Slan.<br>Also there's this guy.</br></br>  <br>Kek i drew that <br>I should make a better one</br></br>  <br>That'd be  infuriating .<br><br>I can see it happening too. Like Guts is about to finish Griffith off but Casca takes the blow for him telling Guts how much she loves Griffith as she dies in Guts's arms.</br></br></br>   Will Gattsu get a happy ending? <br>Only after Casca dies.</br>  Did Gatts have a hard life, lads?  <br>literally why</br>  Is there a legitimate reason why they never adapt anything beyond the Golden Age into anime?  <br>all other arcs beside black swordsman arc require some form of context</br>  <br>Anime was made back in the 90s, so they pretty much just had Golden Age as a complete story arc at that time. The movies didn't make money, so they aren't making the story arcs.</br>    <br> Will Guts get a happy ending <br>No, he's fighting against a god that controls that fate of all mankind.</br></br>  <br> hello i'm here for the job interview </br>  <br>We're not getting any movies of post-golden age stuff?<br><br>no ;_;</br></br></br>  Would you have killed Isidro ?  hate to be that guy but where is the best place to read beserk, translations are so shoddy everywhere i look  <br>best quality dl : https://bakabt.me/torrent/162057/be<wbr>rserk-scans</wbr></br>  <br>thanks anon</br>  <br>did guts fucked casca and had another kid again?<br>im still on the conviction arc</br></br>  <br>Remind me what he is apologising for again?</br>  :(  <br>He lost Casca and Nina to the Holy See's army</br>  Is that the failed abortion?  <br> guts <br> happy <br><br>He was never happy. Except that one time when he was horsing around with griffith and throwing water on each other in a heterosexual manner. He was happy then. But then griffith killed all his friends and raped his girlfriend. He will be happy when he is dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus</br>  <br>This death will be his ultimate happiness I hope Miura gives him a good one and Kill Casca.</br>  <br>Good taste</br>  <br>He was happy when he took Caska virginity too.</br>  Dangerously close enough.     yfw you realize Kaido is Oda's way of making fun of people telling him to kill himself because they don't like his manga   <br><br>Fanart by etc. etc</br></br>  <br>So if weapons break on Big K then Moria might've tried to go for a cheap win by cutting big Ks shadow off only to have his scissors snap apart and slice himself up.</br>  Glad I didn't read the spoilers, this was a great wake-up this morning.  Holy shit, is this real? My dick is harder than stone. This is way better than anything I imagined.  <br>too much boobs</br>  Great chapter. Why is ther no talking about it here?  <br>There was already a huge thread when the issue came out hours ago. This is the late comer after party where everyone is asleep/at work.</br>   reveal Kaido <br> he wants to make a greatest war in a world <br><br>If that aint hype I dont know what is.<br>Also funny how Apoo and Basil are scared but Kidd only seems angry.</br></br></br></br>  So Kaido is a shitter who has only gotten to where he is by being a lucker dog.<br><br>DISGUSTING.</br></br>  So, I don't get it. Does he WANT to kill himself? Or does he just do it for fun because he knows he will live?  So… apparently the rest of the crew managed to escape, and the 3 eyed girl went with them??? Are they fighting Kaidos crew in Zou?<br><br>Why is Kaido going after the Kidd Alliance? Did Urouge become his ally?<br><br>Holy shit I have a lot of questions.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is Kaido going after the Kidd Alliance? <br>He doesn't. He just happened to fall next to them. Urouge just happened to meet him.</br></br>  <br> too much boobs </br>  So does this mean Kaido, the king of beasts, doesn't have a devil fruit?<br><br>Because jumping from there would be pretty stupid if he ended up falling in the water.</br></br>  <br>He was trying to commit suicide.</br>  So, since the guy who attacked Brook and Nami is a sheep man, it's probably save to say they are Kaido's men. (Plus there was an elephant, but an elephant fruit is alread in use.) Why are they searching for Kinemon? (Assuming that Kinemon is the samurai they talked about, who they assumed would be with the strawhats.)<br><br><br>He probably just jumped when he saw land. Or he tried to kill himself but was just "lucky".<br><br>Quick, what animals are said to be immortal/have multiple lifes?<br><br>Cats, obviously. Or snakes. But Kaido does not look really cat'ish to me. And snake zoans are already in use.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nemean lion</br>  Do you think Kaido goes on /fit/? I mean look at him.  <br>Stop posting this, the top one looks nothing like him aside from maybe hair, and the only similarities with the bottom is they have a left arm tattoo.</br>  <br> the only similarities with the bottom is they have a left arm tattoo <br>Are you implying that's not enough?</br></br>  <br>Yes, the tattoos don't even look similar. The Rock seems to have a tribal tattoo where Kaido seems to have a japanese tattoo.</br>  There has to be a reason for all of the yonkou to not go straight for the One Piece.<br><br>Shanks knows what it is, I guess, and doesn't want it.<br>Whitebeard knows it exists, but his goal in life was to have a family, not treasure.<br>Kaido just wants to an hero apparently?<br>Big Mom is only in it for the sweets.<br>And Blackbeard is still busy building his territory.<br><br>Come to think of it, the "One Piece" is getting less and less important the closer we get to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun. He realised he can't die by conventional or abnormal means and is just seeing how much he can survive.</br>  <br>Who cares about the drawing?<br><br>Left arm + left pectoral tattoos aren't common.</br></br></br>  <br>Aside from them not wanting it, I would say it's pretty near impossible to find the island without a fuckload of luck.</br>  <br> Also funny how Apoo and Basil are scared but Kidd only seems angry. <br><br>Fucker probably knows he's about to lose another limb fucking around with these damn Emperors.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why is he cursing after having survived the fall from the cloud? And the narrator said he searched a place to die. (The narrator in One Piece is usually reliable, isn't he?) Kaido also said something about Whitebeard having done it, so he should be able to do it aswell. (Though this is kinda weird, the translations are all very ambiguous.)<br><br>I think it is save to say he wants to commit suicide.</br></br></br>  <br> Left arm + left pectoral tattoos aren't common. <br>http://lmgtfy.com/?q=yakuza+arm+tat<wbr>too</wbr></br></br>  <br>I think Sakazuki has that aswell.</br>  <br>He does. A different pattern though of course.</br>  <br>so did whitebeard tell kaido to jump off a sky island 2 years ago and he did it?<br>the absolute madman</br></br>  <br>He's based on /fit/.</br>  <br>Meh, The Rock is also Hercules which is the strongest man just as Kaido.</br>  <br>It seems like Kaido wants to go the way of the Whitebeard and die.</br>  <br>WB's dead.</br>  <br>Kaido is the strongest creature, not the strongest man. Shirohige is the strongest man.</br>  <br>mirin</br>  <br>huehue</br>  <br> hage  is the strongest man.</br>  <br><br>Hydra<br>Byakko (we have Suzaku in Marco, arguably).<br>Chimaera</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which one is stronger ? Whitebeard or Kaidou ?</br>  <br>Kaido is both creature and man. And Whitebeard is also dead.</br>  Is Kaido's crew going to be like Doffy's with 1 really strong captain and then a bunch of jobbers.  <br>Whitebeard was stronger. Kaido is a shitter who has been captured by the marines 18 times.<br><br>Whitebeard would just need to lock him up and let him rot since he can't actually kill him due to lucker dog status.</br></br></br>  <br>hopefully not<br>i want alabasta/enies lobby fights back</br></br>  <br>Had a skin that couldn't be pierced. Not sure that's the same thing.</br>  <br>Whitebeard likely left that scar on his abdomen. It may be less that he wants to die and more that he's bored with being nearly invincible and few at sea can stand up to his might.<br><br>He's an unfulfilled thrillseeker.</br></br></br>  <br>this is what zyzz-worshippers actually believe.</br>  <br><br>Well if he really wants to kill himself all the time then it would be kind of a plot hole if he has a devils fruit, cause then he would just have to jump into the ocean to get the job done.</br></br>  <br>No, because we know it's needed to set up the final arc. It's becoming more and more important, what's becoming clear is someone special is needed to use it. Whitebeard knew what it was and knew Blackbeard wasn't the one who could use it so clearly not everyone can take advantage of whatever it is. Shanks knows what it is and has specifically been grooming Luffy to use it because he knows Luffy is the one Roger has been waiting for.</br>  <br>you can die by jumping into the ocean even if you don't have a devil fruit<br>just saying</br></br>  <br>He is a yonko. His crew will be strong, since it has to control territory.<br><br>Also, I am fucking glaf that Kaido doesn't have a goofy design. There is a little too much goof in One Piece character design ever since the time skip for my taste.</br></br></br>  <br>So he just needs to find a really large sauna?</br>  <br>whatever it is, it will cause luffy to destroy marejois and fishman island along with it, just like shirley predicted</br>  <br>His hobby being suicide isn't goofy?</br>  So does this chapter confirm that Kaido himself doesn't have a devil fruit?<br><br>If he did have one, couldn't he just throw himself into the sea?</br></br>  <br>Whitebeard is the unstoppable force and Kaido is the immovable object.<br><br>It's a fight without an end.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Fishman Island depends on the tree Eve, which grows straight to Marijoa.<br><br><br>It does not seem to be a hobby, it seems that he genuinely wants to die. And that is more tragic than goofy.<br><br><br>It'd be hillarious if he tried several times and each time landed on a seaking or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, an unstoppable force and an immovable object would just phase through each other.</br>  <br>What I was trying to say is that it should be easy for him to die if he has a devil fruit because of the way they work. So him being depressed because he can't kill himself wouldn't make much sense if he has eaten one.</br>  <br> It does not seem to be a hobby </br>  <br>It doesn't confirm anything. Kaido just amuses himself in finding ways to get killed, but his body keeps surviving and getting stronger. He probably doesn't want a boring death like eating 2 fruits/diving into the sea/ingesting Magellan's poison, etc.</br>  <br>I love you</br>  <br> Kaido is a devil fruit user <br> throw himself into the ocean <br> sink o the bottom <br> give no fucks and walk to the surface again </br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because Mangapanda is better that Mangastream doesn't mean it's 100% accurate.</br>  <br>GR8 B8 M8</br>  <br>Spears broke against Kaido's skin, so it is at least one of his superpowers.</br>  <br>I was browsing /a/ and sadly saw <br><br><br>It still had impact, but damn...</br></br></br></br>    <br>oh wow</br>  <br>Just some good ol' tekkai</br>  <br> Just because Mangapanda is better that Mangastream </br>  <br>I miss them too man maybe if Oda has the other strawhats do something meaningful other than fighting jobbers. Hopefully withfights that push them to their limits we might get some more meaningful development for them.</br>  <br>wow rude</br>  <br>Are you serious?!</br>  So was Kaido Ope Ope'd? Is that why he's seemingly immortal? Or is it something else?      <br>well maybe if dofla learned about ope ope from him it would make some sense<br> kaido confirmed for joining luffy-law aliance </br></br>  <br>Whatever happened, I'm glad it happened.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Is it me or is that speech bubble covering his eyes just like Doffy's?</br>  <br>Ask Kanjuro</br>  <br>thank god, his new design seems much cooler than the old silhouette.</br>  <br>where are the horns coming from?</br>  <br>Isn't that proto-Big Mom?</br>  <br> kaido blinded himself to be more vulnerable </br>  <br>nah big mom is the blue one</br>   Kaido's crew is looking for a samurai <br> Kaido's tattoo looks Japanese; his clothes look kind of Japanese <br>So I'm guessing there's a connection between Kaido and Zo. Maybe Kaidou was originally a samurai himself?</br></br>  <br>It's the same, faggot!</br>  <br>first is mankind and next is the rock</br>  Kaidou fucking sucks<br>"Captured by the navy and Yonko 18 times, tortured over one thousand"<br>All that hype for nothing, I bet he'll be outsmarted by Kidd team.</br></br>  <br>You do realise the original shichibukai silhouettes all looked like Mihawk right?</br>  <br>is anyone else reminded of oars with those horns</br>  <br>oh god I knew it.<br><br>It's been fun everyone</br></br></br>  <br> WHAT HAPPENED? <br><br>2 years timeskip</br></br></br>  Doesn't really look like a monkey to me. <br>Guess Sun Wukong is off the table.</br>   really wanted a Supernova war <br> each supernova picking a side between Kid and Luffy <br> they're all headed for Wano and will probably team up like a bunch of faggots </br></br>  <br>Squats and oats.</br>  <br> anime silhouette <br> canon <br><br>Do you even try?</br></br></br></br>  <br>this, they all became leaches for eachother or yonos</br>  <br>Doesn't take much to outsmart a guy that didn't try to drown himself</br>  <br>not too far from the one in the manga</br>  <br>The anime silhouette was based on the silhouette that appeared in chapter 432, which was released in 2006.<br> pretending you know what you're talking about <br>Do you even try?</br></br></br>  <br>So I told Kaidou to kill himself my man... and he actually tried to do it, the absolute madman!</br>  <br>It's based off the manga one you sperglord, calm your titties.</br>  <br>you should have posted the manga one from the start<br>not even that guy</br></br>  <br>The one in the manga is small and partially obscured by Garp, the one in the anime is the same, only bigger and clearer.</br>  Calling it right now<br><br>Kaido will blame Big Mom for "making" Luffy and Law attack Doflamingo since she was in the area at the time, and because he's a suicidal maniac that is now much weaker with Doflamingo taken out<br><br>The war will be between Big Mom and Kaido, as Kaido has an all-out attack on Fishman's Island after he finds out about Poseidon from Caribou<br><br>The war will result in Luffy destroying Fishman Island, and one of the Yonko taking out the other, and the Strawhats taking out the victor, just like a weakened Whitebeard and the Blackbeard Pirates<br><br>This will free up most of the main pirates, especially Luffy and Blackbeard, and the Marines, as everyone tries to fill the void Kaido and Big Mom will leave<br><br>This will also free up the Strawhats as they try to navigate the New World now, since they'll only have 1 hostile Yonko in their path, and the Marines</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So wait who is Luffy's first mate now again? Is it Zoro or Usopp?  <br>Maybe he did try but survived days without air so he got bored of drowning.</br>   people made this leak years ago <br><br> it was closer to the truth than we thought </br></br>  Holy shit, what a fucking chapter.<br><br> yfw Mr. Prince is back <br><br>Fuck yeah, I missed Sanji</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We already knew this was going to happen. Law stated you either join the Yonko or fight them to survive in the New World.</br></br>  <br>Eyes, nose, moustache are the same. We didn't see the rest of his head (including horns) or his body.<br><br>Nothing is wrong with this silhouette.<br><br>There is a bigger differencce between Big Mom's silhouette and her revealed appearance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why I love OP. The theories.</br>  <br>I think the destruction of FI is going to happen towards the end of the series, either due to shifting the world, or just simply the destruction of segregated fishmen/human societies. I'm sure no matter how it's going to happen, Luffy won't just fucking destroy the place for a bad reason.</br>  <br>That just shows how generic Kaidou design is</br>  <br>kek.</br>  <br>No it's like in the Disney Hercules movie where the Fates tried to cut Hercule's thread but the scissors wouldn't cut</br>  <br>personally I wouldn't mind big mom looking like that at all.</br>  <br> kid alliance takes out a yonko <br> luffy alliance takes out a yonko (luffy's mentor) <br> kid vs luffy war <br><br>now we're just gonna have Thriller Bark 2.0 because Luffy isn't even close to yonko tier</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This happened.<br> It also needs an edit ASAP. </br></br>   Kaido knew how whitebeard was killed <br> asked his army to do the exact same to him <br> didn't work <br> FUCK YOU WHITEBEARD </br></br></br>  <br>too much OC today. I can't handle it</br>  Akagami Kaizokudan????  <br> Implying he didn't just let himself be captured to see if they could kill him. <br> When they failed and he got bored, he just walked out and they couldn't stop him from leaving </br></br>  <br>are you started from Marineford?</br>    <br>Sounds good but I like the theory where luffy destroys fishman island after finding the one piece more.<br><br> One Piece is a weapon designed by Joy Boy to destroy the Red Line at reverse mountain and mariejois, unifying the grand line and the four oceans into one sea, eliminating the calm belts, and ultimately making seafaring more convenient. Noah's Arc was built to ferry the inhabitants of Fishman Island to the surface so that the land above FI where mariejois sits can safely be destroyed without the debris killing FI's inhabitants.  <br> Unfortunately Joy Boy was stopped during the void century by what is now the WG. Luffy will use One Piece to do all this and fulfill the prophecy of him destroying FI, but it will be a good thing because the Fishmen will be able to live under the sun. <br> This will fulfill Luffy's goal of being able to sail freely, will create All Blue for Sanji, will make it easier for Franky to fulfill his goal of building a ship that sails the whole world and Nami's goal of drawing a world map, and allows Brooke to reunite with Laboon. It will also necessitate that Robin fulfills her goal too before this can all come to be. <br><br> That's why it is One Piece: the whole world becomes ONE PIECE. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could see Luffy evacuating the residents with Noah, and then destroying Fishman Island in an attempt to drown Big Mom and Kaidou, who would be fighting it out in there</br>  I don't think Kaidou realizes that Doffy has been captured.<br><br>Que Doflamingo retrieval arc</br></br>  <br><br> Pssh nothing personnel Kidd </br></br>  <br>kek</br>   Kaidou is the hito hito no model Oni <br> Big mom is hito hito no model Onibaba </br>  <br>psssh........nothin personnel kid</br>  <br>They wasn't real silhouettes. They was only how Yoshaku imagined them.</br>   Doffy about to be executed <br> Kaidou appears with his army </br>  <br> Doffy begs to get executed faster </br>  <br><br>*Kidd.</br></br>  <br>Akainu</br>  Nami's looking hot. Did she get raped on that third world island?    <br> unstoppable force <br> get stopped by a magmaguy and some darkness ass jobber <br><br> just kidding. I wish we had seen WB fighting in his prime. </br></br></br></br>  <br>TOO SOON TO KNOW THE ENDING</br>  <br>Despite getting quite a beating Akainu won, he destroyed half of Whitebeard's head and left a huge hole in his body. Ole WB would have died even without the BB pirates' help</br>  <br>The problem is with whitebeard in his prime we wouldn't be able to progress the story. he would be smacking down bitches left and right while drinking sake.</br>  <br>Brook's new clothes are real nice, I'm glad he has some new shades.</br>  <br>yes of course, I know it, I just said I would have liked to see a glimpse of his true force. It was perfectly fine like that to me, a weakened Whitebeard who still managed to fuck Marineford's shit up by himself</br>  <br> implying bandages and a good nights sleep wouldn't have healed that right up </br>  <br>I thought it was Franky at first</br>   all of those balloons under the Sky Island <br>top lel</br>  <br>It will be like Whitebeard<br>He'll have 2-3 legit strong guys and then everyone else will be a useless shitter</br></br>   took 2 years to finally see team sunny again   <br>It's been too long to recall what they last looked like,</br>  <br>Well, I don't think they could have stopped his quaking power.

Holy shit, it's happening! </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That cracked me up too.<br><br>Feels like Oda's been waiting to draw this chapter for a long time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeaaaah.<br><br>Well, there were 3 of them working together to stop it. Or whatever.</br></br></br>  So /a/ how do you kill the Kaido?    <br>Tell him he'll never be with his waifu.</br>  <br>THROW A ROCK AT HIM!</br>  <br>Just have Law pull out his heart and get Luffy to Grizzly Magnum it or something</br>  <br>Have oda kill him</br>  <br>With fire.</br>  Hopefully Oda doesn't off panel this, i want to see how they talk their way out of being killed by Kaido  <br>you shoot him up in the space with a volcanic explosion</br>    <br>Luffy punches him really hard with rubber punches</br>  <br> Sanji is now the strongest strawhat in the island </br>  <br>I don't know, man. It the Doflamingo fight was already that long, we'll be getting a whole year of chapters out of Kaido's fight. Shit will be intense.</br>  <br>If the Ope Ope can give immortality it can surely take it [poiler]:^)</br>    <br>Gear 7.</br>  Kaidou is obviously from elbauf  <br>JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOO</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Davy Jones locker</br>  <br>Something something whatever kills him will be an asspull something</br>  can't wait to see full nigger haki mode kaido  <br>Throw him into space.</br>  Why is Shanks in fairy tail?  <br> Big Mom is only in it for the sweets. <br>Fuck you, Oda. This fat shaming needs to stop.</br></br>  <br> Sanji gets the lowest bounty on the crew after Chopper because the Marines didn't see him do anything <br> They put the picture of Sabaody's fake Sanji </br></br>  <br>Post timeskip awakened Foxy</br>  <br>He's half continent-puller giant and half human.

Felt like way less time than that. Damn.</br>  <br>Stairs</br>  <br>But I posted a pic explaining it better.</br>   Urogue has no fear of the strongest living being and even calls him "friend" while having a chat <br> Tries to talk him out of suicide <br> Prays for him after accepting his wishes <br>How is this man so based?</br></br></br>  <br>Is it weird that this is the most inspiring way of being told to lift that I have ever heard in my life?</br>  <br>Is that why it's shit?</br>   We will never see penguin, Bepo, or Shachi ever again   <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Forgot pic</br>  <br>he just is.</br>  <br>dat nigga huge</br>  <br>But I love One Piece.<br><br>Fairy Tail was mediocre shounen at best.</br></br></br>  <br> Usopp gets highest bounty after Luffy </br>    <br>That's fucked up but oh so perfect.</br>  THIS was the strongest character of the entire OPverse hyped to all hell and back? He seems like a madman. I was hoping for a truly despicable terror, not some whackjob who starts wars for fun.  <br> 2 years ago Shanks stopped Kaidou from going to marineford <br> Kidd alliance are targeting Shanks <br> Kaidou literally jumps out of the sky and lands where Kidd is <br><br>I hope Kaidou doesn't hold a grudge against Shanks and decide to team up with Kidd</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of breaks, when will we get next chapter? I didn't see any text at the bottom saying he's going on a hiatus.</br>  <br>But he's not a Japanese teenage girl</br>  <br>Why is Shanks in One-Punch Man?</br>  <br> make him eat a Smile or a DF <br> Tell him swimming will kill him </br></br>  <br> mfw you think that Oda actually reads these cancerous ass threads </br>  <br>Dragon will kick his ass. <br><br>Also, he looks really dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>Chapter next week, then a break for the whole JUMP</br>  <br>How can you be so sure?</br>  So can't Moriah kill Kaidou by taking his shadow and letting the sun do the rest?  <br>We just has a break last week.</br>  <br>It's fucking perfect.</br>  <br>new chapter out yet?</br>  <br> Kaidou jumps in the sea, the sea jumps out. </br>  <br>I don't get why he doesn't just jump in the water<br>does he not need to breathe either?</br></br>  <br> wants to die but can't because this is the One Piece world <br>Wow, I actually feel bad for him.</br></br>  <br>Who says 10000 meters? Just say 10 km</br>  <br>He's a legend. <br><br> Just like her :^) </br></br></br>  <br>Nothing can kill Kaido, not even that.</br>  <br> yfw his fruit turn him into godzilla </br>  <br>They normally talk in metres in regards to altitude iirc.</br>  <br> His Haki is so strong DF powers don't work on him <br> Sugar once touched him and nothing hapened </br></br>  <br>What the fuck is up with all those balloons under the clouds?</br>  <br>high numbers sound bigger</br>  <br>Why? Is it a Japanese language quirk?</br>  Whatever kills Kaido will be very fucking stupid  <br><br>Some sort of gear/haki power up that's thin and sharp that pierces his body, then luffy expands to elephant size and blows Kaido to pieces, making it the most gruesome one piece death in history.</br></br>  <br>Has anyone just tried giving him AIDS?</br>  <br> Balloons contain the dreams of children <br> Instead of floating up and popping once the pressure has gotten too much, they instead find themselves helping to keep a sky island afloat <br> Skypeia and other sky islands are places of myth <br> The dreams of children help keep a man's romance afloat <br>It's romantic!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He forgot to say "poorly".<br>It's such a shame, Rave Master was pretty cool.</br></br></br>  <br><br>WB would've killed him though at the same time if they had kept fighting, same scene.</br></br>  <br> Luffy <br> killing anyone </br></br>  <br>something like this?</br>  Caesar will be friends with the strawhats really soon. Although he is unchained he does nothing to get his heart back. And don't tell me he's afraid that they'd actually pierce it.  <br> Tell him swimming will kill him <br>But amongst all the creatures that swim, he's still the strongest. So, going with the quote of how "the strong live, the weak die", if he dies, no other creature that swims in the sea can live either since none of them are stronger than Kaidou.</br></br>  <br>Didn't Law say they were going to meet up with his crew?</br>  <br>rave master is the exact same with the same bland characters and asspulls but pretending to have a plot.</br>  <br>Probably.<br><br>Even if Kaido is a devil fruit user<br> throw himself into the ocean <br> sink to the bottom <br> give no fucks <br> get bored and walk to the surface again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How strong do you think Kaido's crew is?  Maybe he can only die if he doesn't want to die.  <br>weren't it for the fact he's a psycho and that he and luffy would never get along, I would love for him to join the crew.</br>  So Kaido is basically like the Juggernaut from X-Men only with a death wish?  <br>Gomu Gomu no Bazooka into the sun.</br>  <br> death wish <br>There's probably more to it than that. He probably used to have a death wish, back when he got captured all the time. Now he's probably over it and only seems to suicide for fun. He seems like a guy who craves battles and warfare, and to establish his dominance as the strongest.</br></br>  <br>Have him eat 2 Devil Fruits?</br>  <br>I'd say he's more the Moe Sizlak of One Piece.</br>  Who wants to make Kaido, the most interesting man in the world edits?  Could Saitama kill Kaido?  <br><br>Literally<br><br>who?</br></br></br></br>  <br>finally a skirt</br>   one piece <br> nothing has been happening for the last 100 chapters <br> one character reveal <br> everybody loses their shit <br><br>One Piece fans are really the worst</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Simpsons bartender.<br><br>What?</br></br></br>  Improved version  <br>It might take a few hits, but yes.</br>  <br><br>This fucking war better start at 800.<br><br>Knowing it is one piece, it will problably be longer.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  DOFFYFAGS<br><br>B L O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>L O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>N T H E F U C K O U T<br><br>T H E F U C K O U T<br>H E F U C K O U T<br>E F U C K O U T<br><br>F U C K O U T<br>U C K O U T <br>C K O U T<br>K O U T<br><br>O U T<br>U T<br>T<br><br>LUFFY IS ADMIRAL LEVEL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>10/10.</br></br>  <br> Sugar once touched him and nothing hapened <br>But he got a boner.</br></br>  <br> He's never heard of the Simpsons </br>  <br>Luffy is Admiral level only for a few minutes and then has to take a break</br>  <br> Nothin personnel, Kidd... </br>  Is this Kaidou's hat of choice?  <br> stay in their threads <br> only have weekly chapter threads <br> worst <br>Nah. At this point the Hibike! and Fate threads are way worse. Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  So...if the Kids crew wants to take out Shanks, Kaido wants to start a big war, and Big Mom was chasing down Shanks et al, couldn't we be seeing a Yonkou war coming up? <br><br>I also don't think that was Kaidou's crew chasing Sanji. Why would they want the samurai but leave Caesar there?</br></br>  <br>He already ate hundreds of smiley.<br><br>inb4 they doesn't worked because they are only artificial DF's</br></br></br>  <br><br>Whitebeard had an OP akuma no mi.<br><br>Kaido apparently has none and is stronger physically.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not the guy you replied to, but I didn't know his full name.

The most sophisticated anime ever created, a tour de force, the pièce de résistance of animation! LoGH is little more than plebeian dreck in comparison, the creators wishing they could have produced an anime with even an inkling of the genius contained within Our Holy K-ON. From the profound debates about eating cake, to the highly philosophical discussions about procrastination, to the marvellous musicianship exhibited by the Light Music Club, K-ON has established itself as the greatest intellectual anime. You cannot disagree unless you are a terrible person. Seriously. It's an infallible law of the universe. K-ON is a masterpiece.

She is cute, fit, easygoing and down to earth, and funny. The other Keions are great too, but the rest of them have more negatives than Ritsu does when looking at them as potential wives. Yui is a complete airhead that would drive me crazy because she would never do anything, ever. Ritsu may be lazy but she is nowhere near as bad as Yui is. Ritsu could be reasoned with and taught to do things. Yui would just forget to do everything I told her to do. Mio and Mugi will both get fat once their metabolism slows down in their early-mid 20s. Many would think that Mugi being rich would be a huge positive for her, but to me it isn't. Even though she would be kind about it, she would always expect more than what I could provide for her on my own. I also would not want to leech off of her family's money. Mio's personality is adorable but overall I prefer Ritsu's. Ritsu is just more interesting to me. Azusa may be the cutest but she would be the most high maintenance wife out of the group. I don't want to deal with her tsundere bullshit for 60 years. Jun is a fucking shit. She deserves no explanation beyond that. Ton-chan would be a better wife than Jun would be.</br></br>  Friendly reminder.  <br>I want her to be like a boxer or MMA fighter or pro wrestler or something so she can be announced enthusiastically by a super deep voiced dude, "DA MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOGS!"</wbr></br>  <br>do not</br>  <br> Azusa may be the cutest but she would be the most high maintenance wife out of the group. <br><br> He wouldn't put effort into his relationship with his waifu and devote his life to her <br>You don't deserve any of the keions</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui is a complete airhead that would drive me crazy because she would never do anything, ever. <br><br>She's the perfect girl for a neet like me.

They are both top tier fap material though</br>  <br>I don't know what that means, but I'll keep it in mind</br>  <br>Honestly Anon... I'm not quite sure. I made it as far as college, a fucking ocean away from my old life, but I am still alone. I think what's really going to help is having somebody by your side, pushing you forward. Not even a girlfriend or anything, just a good friend who understands and cares for you. <br><br>I haven't found that kind of a person.<br><br> It would be quite nice to feel something strong for another person. My feelings are quite muted, it seems, and I guess I'm a masochist, but wouldn't that be better than not feeling anything for anyone at all? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mio strikes me as the kind of girl who becomes addicted to things like sex, drugs, and alcohol having not been exposed to these things in her teen years, the kind of girl who has several trips to the hospital for stomach pumping in her freshman year of university.</br>  <br>upvoted and liked</br>  <br>Yesterday you said tomorrow</br>  <br>That's natural born slut. The second she tastes dick she can't get enough of it and from then onwards requires a good dicking at least 3-6 times a week, and with increasingly more participants.
