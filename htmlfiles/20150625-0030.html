[ What's the worst anime you've ever seen?   SAO compared to most anime, is mid-tier.   1. aldnoah zero 2. valvrave    Wrong board m8.  /a/ is pleb island nowadays so Naruto,KLK and SAO are the best thing ever.      Yakumo tantei was pretty goddamned bad.  Mahou sensou was awful, Togainu no chi adaptation also sucked about a million dicks, and not in the good way.     Worst anime is anime you don't finish after 3rd episode.   /this    It's either this steaming piece of shit or Mirai Nikki   probably trinity blood or DMC    At least this shit was very unique, won't lie, I was enjoying the ride despite the shitty animation.    Probably your favorite anime, OP.     Your favourite anime.    It's funny because Seraph of the End is 100% shit. I honestly have no clue why I love it so much. Right on the money, anon.   Witch of the East Soul Link Tokkou      le SAO is shit because normalfags like it XD meme  SAO is mediocre at worst. If SAO is the worst anime you've ever seen, you're equally as pleb as those who think SAO is the greatest.     Symphoshit, it's literally edge and asspulls the anime. Most poorly written garbage I've ever seen.     worst anime i've ever seen   posts a mid-tier anime   watch some REAL shit.       Glasslip. Five hours I'll never get back.   Code Geass. I dropped the series in the episode where they spend the whole time looking for a cat. It wasn't deep, thrilling or fascinating like you bastards make it look. The protagonist was bland and edgy, the plot didn't make any sense and the animation was hentai tier.    a mediocre anime is the worst thing he's ever seen    that must mean he's a pleb for not watching complete and utter shit!  10/10, I didn't think anyone could be that stupid      Cool story, bro.    its a certain type of shit that i can't stand. like eureka 7 and accel world, they're so cheesy i couldn't make it past the 4th episode. i mean just terribly terribly cheesy     Funny thing is, I never said SAO is the worst thing I've ever seen. I just chose that picture because I knew it'd probably be a popular choice.     I don't think worst is the word you're looking for. Overrated is more like it. Unless SAO IS the worst anime you've seen, which just means you haven't seen that much. I just finished watching Attack on Titan. It is by no means the worst anime I've ever seen, but it is extremely overrated.   NGE   Easily No Game No Life  The shit characters, the shit plot, the asspulls, the fanservice were all on a completely different level to anything else I've actually finished   the art was nice though         This fucking anime. Holy shit. I don't know if the games are good or something but this felt like it was written by a 12 year old. Fuck. I couldn't even get into it as a PARODY of ninja anime.     literal decades of productions   the worst I can come up with is a mediocre SoL   Wow. What a reply. I, for one, am stunned by your impeccable ability to construct such wise and nigh-flawless posts. If even half the board put as much effort and thought into their posts, I'm sure the board's collective intelligence and overall understanding of the anime medium would reach unforeseen heights.      Such a shame since the girls are cute as hell.   lol. Are you insulted by that?    Yes    No it's only the freshest bad anime in your mind, there have been god aweful woeful ones out there.    Okay.    I'm insulted by everyone's inability to go five seconds without being a complete and utter retard who spews his turdwaste opinions all over this fucking website.    I think you're lookin' for /b/, m8.   <br/>    people who have standards belong on /b/  Kill yourself.     k-on    Can do, buddy.   If only for the obvious LN bait ending  Green Green. Nothing will ever be worse than that.    Alright, glad we could reach a consensus.   Fujoshit of the worst kind.   Actually now that I think about it, this was worse. This is fujoshit for fujos that like being treated like shit.   Legit opinion :   Death Note  Stopped watching after the first half, it's supposed to end there. I read the summary on wikipedia and I'm glad I don't watch further, because the ending is shit.   Code Geass  Stopped watching after S1, it's supposed to end there I don't even read the summary on wikipedia but I know the ending is shit.   Mirai Nikki  Stopped watching after the first half, I'm sure it will end with trainwreck.   Ragnarok Online   Jigoku Shoujo   Rosario + Vampire  Pure crap                   If that stuff is the worst you've seen, then you've been pretty lucky.   Daily reminder.   Illuminate all the good parts and ignore all the bad parts and everything is a prefect ten.   Either Fate or Fate UBW, yes they´re worse than SAO. SAO at least doesn´t pretend to be anything other than fat otaku power fantasy harem pandering. Fate pretend to be something more than k-drama cringe tier.    Oh man, that day was great.     In terms of intellectual bankruptcy, RahXephon. It's so obviously an Evangelion ripoff that it outright steals entire sequences, characters and a good chunk of pre-Red Cross Book speculation about what happened in Eva. It has a better ending that's the result of an even bigger set of deus ex machinas than are required to set up the premise in the first place.  In terms of QUALITY, I watched a bit of the original Getter Robo the other day and found it painful, but that's purely due to aging. I'm sure it was great for its time.      SAO is 2/10 friend     even thinking about considering samflam bad  You officially have the worst taste out of anyone that's ever been on /a/.    Is this the thread where we only post anime that's popular amongst the general public or buzzword websites like reddit and tumblr and dig for generic overused excuses for why they're shit?   Green Green. I want to forget ever watching that show. Master of Marital Hearts at least had the decency to mindbreak me with it's crazy last episode.   Objectively? It's Mars of Destruction. Even if it's a meme it's legitimately one of the worse ever.  Personally? School Days. I have never hated an anime character more than that piece of shit Makoto Itou.    Guys, this is the worst anime you've ever seen thread. Stop namedropping big shows. If what some of you are posting is legitimately the worst you've seen, then you really need to get some more shows under your belt.     Ironically I found the ugly girl the only one worth fapping to. She basically saved the show for me. Although it was still terrible.     Evangelion would be the absolute worst, followed by Fate/stay Night  Sakura Trick  School Days. Hilariously bad, failed in almost every possible way.   No shit. I guess they should consider themselves lucky that they've never seen anything that's actually terrible.   Dragonauts   Ow man i never thought thumblr raids can be this entertaining.    I'm just going to say you have bad taste, because I honestly cant fathom how you consider either of those shows to be the worst you've ever seen, unless those are the only shows you've ever seen.     Death Note   Code Geass  Actually those two have good endings.   Rosario to Vampire is only for fanservice. You either want that or you don't.         I agree with Rosario + Vampire. Most anime is otaku shit that is saturated with harem and fanservice at the expense of everything else including plot and depth. But with rosario + vampire the characters were too annoying to even enjoy the fanservice as a guilty pleasure.   Also. Fucking split personality girl.       This guy gets it. Green Green is easily the worst anime I've ever watched.   Anyone know why SAO was so bad? I really wanted to like it but just stopped watching after 6 episodes. I can't explain it, I just didn't feel the urge to keep watching.  Easily Wizard Barristers.    I always get a chuckle when someone complains about racism/misogyny or any of that western progressive shit in anime, a medium that (at the moment) is immune to that bullshit. They don't give a fuck, and it warms my heart. You may call a lot of anime shit or all of it shit, but at least it's something that the creators and fans built, maintain, and direct without it being manipulated and tarnished by some blogger who says problematic every other word and doesn't actually give a fuck about anime.      Death Note   HUR DUR tumblr liked this show so its pleb shit!! im not going to watch it entirely and give my shit opinion of why its awful     Lucky Star   Not my choice, but I could see why.   http://<span>youtu.be/UhmBnaEcbfA  [ ]      The LN was your standard haremshit LN, but apparently they made changes to make Kirito seem a lot cooler, basically made him more of a self-insert. I haven't read the LN, just what I heard. Apparently Kirito was really scared fighting against the PKers but in the anime he was fearless. He also lost to Yuuki but the anime made it seem like he wasn't trying to win.       Popotan was the worst thing i ever watched   the love hina and negima! series.      posting bait this obvious      hataraku mahou sama  its just shit  dokuro-chan le random xD       Aku no Hana was absolute shit   It's a solid 3/10 anime. Not the worst, but nowhere near mid-tier.   The worst anime I've seen, in no particular order and without going out of my way to watch bad anime, are Togainu no Chi, Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou ~la pretentious title~, Saint Beast, Higurashi Kira, Sex Pistols, Ookamukakushi and Akikan.  But also SAO, Btoom, Naruto Shippuuden, Maoyuu, Afro Samurai, Death Parade, Persona 4, Seed Destiny. The difference is that I'm neutral towards the shows in the first list and I actively hated these.    To me it was one of the most intense anime that aired recently.        Like after 3 episodes it just went to hell   Naruto Shippuden and Hunter x Hunter. I couldn't get passed the first episode of HxH. The cliches killed it. And when Naruto dedicated it's 400th episode to filler, I knew it was time to give up. The manga ending was so shit. He just wanted to end on chapter 700. These new kids they all had isn't make it better. Tie for the worst.  Probably Dragon Crisis, I kept hoping it would get better but it never did, too bad because the main girl wasn't bad.   You people have absolutely no objective standard of ranking do you?  Hurr durr it aint masterpiece, must be either 1/10 or a 3/10      /thread There is nothing more trash than SOA     You talkin' shit 'bout my shiny robots?    This.     Reign: The Conqueror.   No, it's 3/10 because it's a terrible anime. Should I rank everything that's not literally a slideshow 6+?    Escaflowne    Fight me.      Only time I'd agree with you. Worst one for me also.    Fate/zero    FMA Movie    Kampfer   Submarine 707r      Who let that MAL faggot in the picture into /a/   Kiniro Mosaic. Karen was quite entertaining but apart from that the show is almost completely pointless and a colossal waste of time.  Garzeys Wing still, I can't imagine any series could be less coherent   That was a pretty funny thread   Probably some garbage OVA, say, Maryuu Senki. I don't even seek out the infamously bad ones for laughs. Or Mobile Suit Gundam-san. They somehow made a decent manga into an outright physically painful anime with almost nothing but the worst possible jokes they could pick.   You asked for it OP.   Gantz  Filled with easily solved problems I would see in a badly written B-movie   Strike Witches/ Vividred Operation, Might as well because it felt like the same damn thing.  I tried watching this damn thing 3 times. Fanservice so blatant it's cringey, Formulaic copy pasta first season, like Gantz moments of 'WTF, why do that'.  Vividred was the fastest I've dropped an anime (seven minutes thirty seconds) and still managed to give me a literal headache.   Hyouka  I know /a/ is tired of hearing this, but I found it boring as well. The characters were uninteresting (I hate, hate, HATE Chitanda) and the first mystery was bogus as well  Hyouka = Ice Cream. Really?    Infinite Stratos  Possibly the worst harem I've seen. I didn't like Seitokai no Ichizon's cast either but that had moments of hilarity. Char was the only character I didn't hate in the end and the final episode I didn't even watch fully (alt tabbing and did other things while the player was running)                 But why is it a terrible anime? You've just said that it's terrible without basing it on anything.  "Oh, that anime is terrible but i don't know why i just hate it! hurrdurr i just want to be like all the other people who hate it"  Before you say i'm some sort of fanboy, i don't even like SAO but just because i don't like it doesn't mean it's bad.        Mahou Sensou.  SAO just had some bad writing here and there, but Mahou Sensou was shit through-and-through. Forcing myself to finish even 2 episodes was horrendous.      And then they went on to claim they were a girl, as if to solidify they were nothing more than a shitposter.    But the MAL account was for a girl, it was either legit or someone with way too much time on thier hands     someone with way too much time on thier hands  Mate, this is the internet, and you're on /a/. EVERYONE here has too much time on their hands.      This reminds me of the time a MAL reviewer wrote a One Piece (anime) analysis and posted in on /a/.    Going to MAL, finding a weeb queen to impersonate and then coming up with original pasta is getting into dangerous territory   Honestly. Mahouka.  I get the oniisama meme and all that jazz, but the show is complete and utter garbage. There's no tension, because you know glorious tatsuya will overcome anything with literally zero effort. The parts where he isn't annihilating his enemies without breaking a sweat are boring as shit too. At least SAO was entertainingly bad.      Ctrl + f    no Kill la Kill   Kill la kill This thread would not be full without it!       Wizard barristers.   Blood + is my least favorite title by far.   Honestly, Valvrave. It's not "so bad it's good". It's just so bad it's awful.   It's one of those seasonal Sunrise productions that would be utterly irredeemable if I didn't watch them with /a/    lolnah   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dwk<wbr>ClIFBMEE</wbr>  [ ]  admittedly I did not make it past the opening  honestly most of the stuff that was posted here isn't even bad  but  well I'm a guy who unironically likes Musashi Gundoh so            Easily Wizard Barristers   Haven't seen it, is it really worse than Mezzo or Kite? Because they weren't too bad.       Haven't seen it, is it really worse than Mezzo or Kite?  Here https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ]     Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai   The first episode had some sleek animation in it. Everything afterwords was a train wreck, most notably their lack of budget for the last episode.  Also, the character designs were fucking ugly.     wtf is with all these comments? Its "What's the worst anime you've ever seen?" not "Name a popular anime you dislike and say it's the worst anime ever because /a/"  have none of you seen the crap that was chaos head  YOU ARE SUPER SPECIAL ANONS       this is horrible it souns like s butchered anime of animaniacs or something     Haven't seen it, is it really worse than Mezzo or Kite? Because they weren't too bad.   Wizard Barristers should have been a 1-episode special.  It goes from having a really exciting first episode that had some potential, to total shit.       Weiss Kreuz (it's shit) Lucky Star (talking about bread)    Wow, thanks for reminding me about this fucking abortion, you cunt      ok chaos;head isn't the greatest but the worst? i think that's a bit much. have you seen the vn?     "Name a popular anime you dislike and say it's the worst anime ever because /a/"  its just rebound. people hate hearing people jack off a series they didnt care for     At least we got some good reaction faces out of it.  I say while not posting any images.      wtf         It's not that bad but the game is superior in every way.    Pretty much this. The game shits over the show in every way.   Worst anime I've ever watched was Claymore. I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. I guess the nice designs and art kept me barely strung along.  We all know 70% of anime is 90% garbage. So I'm sure there's worse out there, but I am not shy about dropping, so I haven't watched any.     What's wrong with Death Parade? It wasn't exceptional but definitely not bad either.      I like you.     Why did they turn Alicia into a tsundere bitch in the anime?    It disappointed me and never got better.   Ore Monogatari.  SUNAAAA   SUNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   SUKIDA   SUNAAAAAAAAA   SUKIDAAAAAAAAAAA   YAMATOOOOOOOOOOOO   SUKIDAAAAAAAAAA   SUNAAAAAAAAAA            worst anime you're heard of  Mars of destruction and steel chromed regios were the shows that gave me a violent reaction   bottom of the barrel *bad* show you've never seen  Hatenkou Yuugi (pic related). I always post this one when "worst show" threads pop up, and it legitimatelt is the worst show I've ever watched. too bad that post typically gets lost in slews of "UR FAV ANIME, SAO, NARUTO,LOL" and other mid-tier stuff.   shows I really hated but many folks here loved  Anything by Ryukishi07 and anything by type moon,          She's only really a bit tsundere at the start of the game when Welkin first meets her. But other than that she's sound so they did kinda mess that up   Sacred Seven comes to mind.   forgot pic    I regret it, I regret everything, The ONE ANIME THAT I SHOULD HAVE DROP BEFORE PASSING EPISODE 3.    SAO and Naruto Shippuuden are both worse than Hatenkou Yuugi though. I've seen it, it's 4/10.   Worst I've seen is SAO, best I've seen is Berserk. ( I'm new to anime but I can tell you Berserk is great, I watch a lot of TV and it's probably in my top 3)   I would, but I'm afraid the ass-kicking might fix your fucking nose.     responding three hours later  Did you take a nap to gather courage?    I think it was 3 episodes, but it was 3 episodes of shit that I had to force myself to slog through.  The problem with these threads is that some of the worst anime where you think "Wow, this is technically terrible" are the most entertaining, and you really can't discount the entertainment factor.     The thing was Mirai Nikki was that it was just good enough to keep you watching, but not good enough to ever satisfy.    Fuck you, I had Fate/Stay trolling to do. And Escaflowne is still fucking shit.   Is Photoshop CS6 enough to scanlate or do I need another program to? Or should I rather use Gimp or something?  Photoshop is the industry standard for image manipulation why would you think it's not enough for simple cleaning?  Wasn't there a bunch of scanlation guides on the internet?  Also, gimp is only for mactards and people too stupid to pirate photoshop.    A lot of people don't really recommend Gimp. It's probably passable, but you're better off with PS. I don't think it really matters what version you use, at least not a lot. Some people use content-aware fill for instance but then other people will say that's just lazy or whatever, or only use it sometimes.   tl;dr use whatever the fuck you want.     Gimp is also pretty damn buggy   No, you have to use InDesign.   I don't have too many issues with it, though the only thing I'm doing with gimp is create reaction images.   Photoshop is enough for anything and everything.   But can it bring Ed's mother back to life?    Illustrator is a better vector program    wow this looks pretty cool, but I don't think that anyone uses it for scanlations    That shit is to make magazines and books. You won't ever use it don't listen to him.    The photoshop / illustrator combo allows you to do anything, literally.      Illustrator  Why would you need it if you already have ps?      The only reason against GIMP is the content aware feature of Photoshop really. If you don't have content awareness, you can just use GIMP.     Content aware fill   Just do it with the stamp tool      GIMP has some content aware tools, they vary in effectiveness. Although I have yet to compare them to PS.    I was waiting for something like this.      It just werks bruh   Gimp has them too resynthesizer or heal selection.     gimp   mactards   More like Linux users. Photoshop has been available for Mac since version 1.      Not OP, but what are some recommended PNG settings for saving scans?    Is Photoshop CS6 enough to scanlate or do I need another program to? Or should I rather use Gimp or something?   If you're used to GIMP, use GIMP. If you're used to Photoshop, use Photoshop. For something like scanlation work they're both overkill.  Photoshop is Protoshop for pros who pro around with pro and color spaces and stuff like that you don't need to think about if you're not in the publishing or printing industry.  GIMP is an open source nearly-alternative to it, with 90% of the same functions and capabilities, but with a legacy UI that is quite different. This is the big thing, the UI: both Photoshop and GIMP are complex, and if you're used to one, you'll be driven crazy by the other. I guess technically Photoshop should be better (they must spend some money on UI design), but GIMP is not as bad as it used to be or is rumored to be.    I haven't had GIMP bug out on me in ages. This sounds like old reputation from 2004. Both GIMP and Photoshop are old and mature programs, so I don't expect either to be terribly buggy anymore.  Maybe if you're on Windows, but then you're just flagellating yourself.   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127111275#p127112207">Click here</a> to view the full text.                     old and mature  That's never true for open source programs. They're just buggy in stupid ways that no one will ever fix because it's too annoying. Ok, not ever, but enough years that people will use the alternatives instead.     I should say, for any GUI program. I have nothing against console applications.   ZR vs Tights   My dick approves of both.    ZR no contest.    ZR is superior.   inb4 some fag posts a slut in tights and claims they are pure.   But Kurisu is pure.   https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.   No spoiler summary on the OP? Disappointing.      Coma Cheese  I don't get the joke.    Now that's alpha.    "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"    "No, not really... I just thought that you're incredible."    "Haa? Are you making passes at me again?"    Isshiki shoves spoon into 8man's mouth.    "Do you hate that level of sweetness?"    "...I don't."    "Ah, but I wasn't talking about the flavor..."    She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.    "Even so, my answer is the same."    "Is that so..."    Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.    "Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"    8man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.    "Too sweet..."                               Fresh thread! Fuck yeah /a/  Spoilers from volume 11:  Yukino gives 8man the chocolate.   Spoilers from volume 11:   Iroha won't be in volume 12 because Sensei is going to make sure she's not slacking off at the Service Club     Yukino? I thought Yui was the one giving them.  Better for Yukinofags like me     Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                      Spoiler that shit next time, jesus.    Summary of the entire LN:  -Yui being a retarded whore who can't even say her true feelings and now is getting BTFO because she wants to live a lie -Yukino is a worthless bitch who can't fix her own mess and try to ask for help to everyone, first hayama, then Haruno and now 8man. Fucking dependant whore. -8man is an edgy faggot who try to find muh genuine even if he have that on his face but he's too retarded to make a single desition because he's just a coward. -Haruno take the antagonist role just because all those 3 faggots can't even realize they are living a lie. -Hayama a cunt -SENSEI IS THE ONLY TRUE ENDING BUT WATARI IS A CUCKLORD SO HE'S GOING TO PICK YUI OR YUKINO  Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?             Fuck off retard, stop posting false information      I'll make a summary   Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?      Friendly reminder  To those complaining about Spyro's translations having mistakes, many people here are happy enough to have his translations. Spyro is a damn blessed soul for them. An official translation means having to wait years until it reaches the point where we currently stand, and we don't want that. I will read it raw too because japanese isn't a problem to me, but that's not the case for others here so stop being a retarded fucktards and show some appreciation to Based Syro at least. He's doing this for free. Fucking plebs    Meta cuck   Marvelous.    I'm gonna miss you after this all over. See you in another thread in summer, I guess   No matter how much shitposting we make, you're all great, anons. Couldn't ask for a better, fucking twisted community. Fuck you all anons, fuck you all.    Blatant shitposter obviously trying to false-flag one of the smallest and weakest waifu factions.   Nigga go fuck yourse-   Doesn't bother including Iroha   kek'd. Carry on you gigantic faggot.           Implying he's not falseflagging falseflag     So he's not  genuine ?    Wait, would that mean he's actually a senseifag, or that he intended for his post to be called out as a false flag?   Little sister won right?   She already won before Hachiman got turned down by Orimoto    too lewd    I think this comic will answer your question  (1/3)      Hachiman teachings:  “It’s obvious they did that so no one would suspect them. If it were me, I would’ve avoided slandering one of them on purpose to frame them.”  He intended to be called out as an irohafag falseflagging a weak faction. Either a senseifag who wanted pity or an anti-irohafag      (2/3)    (3/3)    The best.     As to be expected     Maybe so, but I figured that given how Irohafags have been clinging to Iroha's spoon thing that taking a jab at her irrelevance by leaving her out would be far more damning than the meaningless words tossed at everyone else.   Making me read at 4 am   It's a commie meme sub. It sounds like she's saying that but the real joke is that she thought he was talking about the rice which CR surprisingly got right.     Reading  What kind of american are you?     I have a hunch that you are a yukinofag trying to falseflag and frame irohafags   In all honesty, 8man's behavior in the spoon-feeding scene is pretty suspect, and it's possible Iroha realized it too. (Thus her ambiguous reaction to the exchange.) Namely, between the "words she was waiting for" and the "Too sweet" line at the end, there are implications that 8man wasn't being entirely genuine with Iroha here during the spoon dialogue.  The question is, what does it mean if he wasn't? 8man outright lying to Iroha would be an extreme step out of his usual character. Even if he's guilty of falling into non-genuine patterns in the past, he usually never does it directly through dialogue, but instead manufacturing situations where it's not necessary to do so. (Such as the whole valentine's event.) Therefore, even if he isn't being honest with her, it becomes an equally (if not moreso) big event specifically because he's not being honest with her.  In previous scenarios where 8man's non-genuine, it's usually been a misguided and fear-driven attempt to maintain (or, in his words, "protect") something he doesn't want to lose. Take the club for instance, which he effectively froze into a status quo because he was afraid the election would cause their friendship to dissolve. When he stopped being non-genuine with the club, it's not like he gave up on the club itself. He got exactly what he wanted and the club became closer and more "genuine".  1/2          Now let's look at this instance, 8man is clearly being forward with Iroha in this case. Normally when she's being sly and flirtatious he'll tsukkomi, brush it off, or generally not give a proper answer. In this case he actually answers in a positive fashion: "I didn't dislike it." 8man isn't cold/dishonest enough to use Iroha's feelings for utility, so if he's being non-genuine in returning her flirtation it's because he's afraid of what not flirting will do with their relationship. 8man's non-genuine actions stay true to what he genuinely wants, but pursue them in the wrong manner.  For these reasons, even if he's not being genuine in his dialogue with Iroha, it still seems to demonstrate a desire to build a romantic relationship on his part. Furthermore it's not likely that it's "I have to humor her to preserve our friendship", as 8man has been aware of Yui's feelings for quite a while but has not given her the same sort of treatment. It goes without saying that something as cliche as "this isn't genuine, I actually love X" is unlikely, as his prior development shows that a non-genuine attempt to be with Iroha will be backed by a genuine desire to do so.   In conclusion I'd say that Iroha has very likely won 8man's affection, but she has not yet won the 8bowl. The simple reason being that since Watari put in those implications, it's most likely so he can capitalize on them for later drama. As an Irohafag I'm actually pleased about this because, quite frankly, it wouldn't be good writing if things were so simple. Iroha's best and most endearing moment is when she was on the train after being rejected, and she really hasn't been given any particularly emotional scenes other than that. There's upcoming roadbumps but, assuming 8man doesn't catastrophically fuck things up, their relationship will be all the better for it in the end.  2/2           You should stop if you don't even know what those 3 pages were about.    Can't fall asleep so it might help but it was like only 4 minutes long    It's not that Commie didn't got it wrong, it's that it makes sense. I don't know how CR translated it but if they went "Komachi? Who's that, rice?" they went full retard.    We should wait until some anon gives us a proper translation of all six pages, and not just a summary. For instance, I don't know if he said "too sweet" or just "sweet" (amai)     This is kind of a stretch, and that coming from a guy who was happy to see 8man shift from "this was irresponsible of me" to "how do I even ask someone out" with Yui's promise date.     Are you seriously believe that everybody in your fanbase is completely innocent and can do no wrong? And is it somehow always Yukinofags fault?    It's become a bit of a meme to blame literally everything on Yukinofags evwn though literally the only ones waifufagging are Irohafags.    mu dik   Also, despite that I also enjoyed keep talking about saliva and flirting as if they really exists. But in fact this part only has one meaning: It's hinted that Iroha will make a move in the valentine day (or later) using the "preference" she got from 8man in this scene.   He says 甘すぎだな     Does he know? Do you think he still think that Iroha is going after Hayama? He can't be that dense right? A girl waited for him until he show up just to ask him about his choco preference.      Correct me if i am wrong.  From what happen in ,When Yui is saying she want everyone living in lie together with her. She trying to baiting 8man or Yukino to called out her bullshit.  8man bit it and desperate do another genuine speech to convince both Yui and Yukino back on track to find genuine thing together with him instead stray to superficiality.  After 8man speech done, when Yui saying it just like him and smiling.  8man realises Yui intention and that he (and possibly Yukino too) was the one that almost stray to superficiality makes him cry.         He states 甘いすぎだな when she walks away, when licking the chocolate from his cheek.  甘いすぎ literally translates to "too sweet".  That line alone is a pretty big warning flag, especially the way it's used. The "words she was waiting for" is more of an additional nail in the coffin.  And really, it comes down to simple narrative structure. There's no way in Iroha and 8man would get into a relationship without it running into some kind of drama before the end of the series, it wouldn't be refined if it isn't put to the test at any point.          I don't believe irohafags are completely innocent and free of shitposters. However, in this case, it's very unlikely for them to be behind that post. Why would we be so obvious at false-flagging, when we can just circlejerk about the (not confirmed yet) indirect kiss and their flirting afterwards?  Once you discarded irohafags, then the culprit has to be either yukinofag or yuifag. And there are 3 reasons why a yukinofag is most likely behing that post:  He shitted on Yui before Yukino (while the normal order would be Yukino and Yui). He did the same with who will win (Yui first, then Yukino)   Between yukinofags and yuifags, the first ones tend to be more anti-irohafags than the latter (I call it not-first-girl sympathy)   Sensei is like an adult Yukino (although this argument is subjective)           いすぎ     Yes, that was why some anon said she is the hero Service Club deserve.    Feel free to elaborate.  I did maybe go a bit too strongly by taking it for granted that 8man already likes Iroha, but at the very least things are heading in that direction.  The 嫌いじゃねえけど was a very significant statement by 8man. What is currently in question is the exact motivations behind him saying it.       Iroha will win, right?   Now you're projecting  Who's to say it's not Totsukafag or even Hayacuckfag?  Really, no one is fucking innocent. Best bet is to assume all falseflaggers are neutral party who wanted to see the thread burn  Which is what happened with almost every thread anyway.         「えいっ！」 一色の声と一緒に、頬をかすめてスプーンが口に突っ込まれる。突然の出来事<wbr>にもごっとまごつき、目を白黒させていると、その明滅する視界の中で、一色<wbr>が蠱惑的に笑った。 「先輩、こういう甘いの、お嫌いですか？」 スプーンをふりふりしながら、小首を傾げ、一色は上目遣いにこちらを見る。<wbr>いたずらに成功した子供のように得意げな口元の微笑みと、女の子らしく挑発<wbr>的に胸を張る姿はアンバランスで、だからこそひどく魅力的に映る。 「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」 糖分はきっとそこまでではないのだろうけれど、舌が痺れるほどに甘い。てい<wbr>うか、そのスプーンさっき使ってやつじゃないの……、そういうことされると<wbr>ほんと心臓に悪いからやめてほしい……。 疲労には甘いものがいいと言うが、この手の心労には逆効果らしい。どっと押<wbr>し寄せてくる疲れに思わず吐息を漏らすと、一色も同じようにため息を吐いた<wbr>。 「はぁ。別に味の感想聞いたわけじゃないんですけど」 口ぶりこそ興味がなさそうだったが、ちらと向けられた瞳には答えを待ってる<wbr>色がある。 俺は口の中に残る甘さを噛み締めながら、一色の言わんとするところを噛み砕<wbr>いた。</wbr> </wbr>  </wbr></wbr> </wbr></wbr>  </wbr></wbr>  </wbr></wbr>     3 reasons why a yukinofag is most likely behing that post:  All your reasons are bullshit      the words she was waiting for  He fucking knows, anon. He's not buying into the Hayama crap anymore.     She is there for the drama so not likely. She might be another Kuroneko    He picked up enough to give her a forward answer regarding the chocolate. Whether he has a solid idea of how she feels about Hayama I don't know, but whatever he thinks about it he's shown intent in getting closer to Iroha.   My mistake, it's pretty late.      「それでも、答えは変わらんな…」 「…そうですか」 一色は何事か考えるように、腕の中のボウルを見つめてふむふむと頷く。そし<wbr>てぱっと顔を上げた。 「参考になりました。じゃ、ちょっと行ってきますね。葉山せんぱーい！」 にこやかな微笑みで言うが早いか、一色はばたばたと駆け出していく。 それを見送りながら、ほっぺについたチョコを指で拭って口に運んだ。チョコ<wbr>レートとラム酒の香りが鼻を抜けていく。 「甘すぎだな……」 </wbr>   </wbr>     I'll be expecting your full thesis on how Yukinofags did everything wrong by friday. Don't let me down anon   Why is she using to pencils as chopsticks?   I can't figure out whether this is satire or just the ramblings of a retard    Guaranteed replies/10.     “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   MUH FUCKING DICK         W-where is the evidence?       Actually yeah, when you put it that way it's almost undeniable that 8man realizes what he's doing.  He's answering a girl who seemingly likes him by giving her "the words she was waiting for". It sounds like he's going after Iroha but with an eroge-esque mindset of acting with the express purpose of making the girl like you more.  In short, 8man's lack of relationship experience is going to fuck him over.         She is there for the drama  kek, she is there for comic relief       This is fucking delicious, 8man trying to go romantic on Iroha. Thank you Watari, you\re not that much of a cunt now.       Iroha finally wins   might actually just be getting Kuroneko'd   Kill me.      There is not going to be another Kuroneko for at least another decade. Everybody remembers what happened when she got kuroneko'd.     Yeah that's the only really glaring issue. You were building a solid argument, then completely jumped the shark by speculating that 8man might want to actively pursue romance with her.  I am interested in the 嫌いじゃねえけど debate though. I'm passingly familiar with the phrase, but I don't really into moon so I'm probably missing out on some nuance.  The best translation would be "I don't hate it but-" correct?          drama  It is out of her character to be all drama queen like. Even at her lowest when she was shown to be out of her depth during the stuco collab event and at the end of the disneyland, she never made a big deal out of it or cause huge drama.      I'm a Yuifag, but somehow I feel like Irohafags circle jerk is a lot more endurable than Yukinofags circle jerk.    It's nice now that its calmed down. It was goddamned unbearable right after the pages with the tasting scene got posted. Some of those guys turned the autism dial to 13 then broke the knob off.    We don't photoshop saliva or an actual kiss between the two and then shitpost those until the website's duplicate image system prevention kicks in.     The best translation would be "I don't hate it but-" correct?   「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」   But the pause is before the sentence, so it should be But I don't hate it. Another story would be that the pause was at the end, as if he didn't finish the sentence       Stop false flagging!     Just to add something to this, isn't Iroha the only one he went out of his way to talk to during the chocolate-making? Orimoto comes to him, Yukino calls him for chocolate-tasting, and Hayama just happens to be there while he's chilling by the wall. Iroha he actually walks up to and compliments for being able to make sweets, it's almost no surprise that she immediately responds with the hitting-on gag. And then of course we get the sweetness conversation from that.     Basically he thought for a long time before saying this line. His brain was shutting down.    She was made to lose.    The dots / pause came before the sentence. My guess would be "but I don't dislike/hate it". A comma or a repositioning of that pause would change everything.      You must be not here when the fake spoilers were posted for the first tiem.    How can one girl be so fucking best?     "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"  now BTFO yui       How the fuck can you be mad about phoroshop? That's the only good thing to come out of these threads. Not to mention that scene was basically asking to be shopped.    Who the fuck is trying to raise false flags? Fucktards. Yuifags are at least easier to tolerate than Irohafags.   I'm not especially proficient myself but I'm pretty sure it's meaning changes contextually. What you're referring to would be more like 嫌いじゃねえ、けど。。。 which would firmly indicate the けど leads off into something else. When it's just used to end a standard sentence I think it turns into more of a slang/nuance that indicates a non-committal answer.  That said I'm really not an authority. I've heard けど end sentences a lot though and I don't recall it ever being something that significant. It really doesn't make sense contextually for 8man to be using lead-offs in that conversation either.     Holy shit this thread going mad again. Sasuga /a/, I'm going outta here.  Fuck the falseflagger, all of you.      Hayate  Hinagiku end when?     Wait, when did the spoon come off his mouth? The illustration shows this part  She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes.  And he still has the spoon on his mouth.      So basically Yui is Haruno's foil in this volume.    She intervenes when Haruno's needling are making things uncomfortable between Yukino and Hachiman during cooking event, even though it pains her.    When Haruno says she's moving in with Yukino, causing Yukino to despair, Yui invites her to stay with her.    At the end, Yui is the catalyst for the dialogue that leads to the service club finally starting to overcome the problems Haruno exposed.        thinking about what others said about the pause being in front, is it possible that he only vocalized the back half of a thought? like say "It's too sweet, but I don't hate it"     「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."   「甘すぎだな……」"it's too sweet"       Yui is Haruno's foil   Since the beginning. Since Chiba Mura end. Haruno already knew that Yui will be a needle in her plan. Hence she showed unfavorable response to Yui, occasionally      Was that where 2ch was getting the idea that maybe he was rejecting her? Effectively saying "She's not bad, but too sweet for my tastes"  Related to that, how many times could the sweet/naive wordplay be a factor in that scene?       一色の声と一緒に、頬をかすめてスプーンが口に突っ込まれる。突然の出来<wbr>事にもごっとまごつき、目を白黒させていると、その明滅する視界の中で、一<wbr>色が蠱惑的に笑った。</wbr></wbr>  「先輩、こういう甘いの、お嫌いですか？」  スプーンをふりふりしながら、小首を傾げ、一色は上目遣いにこちらを見る<wbr>。いたずらに成功した子供のように得意げな口元の微笑みと、女の子らしく挑<wbr>発的に胸を張る姿はアンバランスで、だからこそひどく魅力的に映る。</wbr></wbr>   I'm cumming bucket now. God blesses Watari-sama.        That's where some of them were coming from, yeah. But then again, others just said that they're trying to read too much into it, that 8man is not going to BTFO somebody like that.      ていうか、そのスプーンさっき使ってやつじゃないの……、そういうことさ<wbr>れるとほんと心臓に悪いからやめてほしい……。</wbr>   Suck this denialfag, it's clearly stated that Iroha had used it before, and 8man is conscious about it.       Now that you mention it, I like that interpretation a lot. It ties in his answer to her question with the last line of the conversation very nicely.  Only thing that it leaves me wondering about is the "answer she was waiting for" bit though. On one hand it carries implications, but on the other it sounds kinda lewd.  I also have a foggier idea about the nuance of the scene now.        The waifufagging and shipping in these threads is absolutely intolerable. I stayed out of Yahari threads for the first half of the season until I caught up with the LNs and I came backing thinking there might be decent threads like before the anime aired, how stupidly mistaken was.   Do you fags actually enjoy spending your time on this shit?     so what do you think "...I don't hate it though" mean?     &gt;She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.   &gt;"Even so, my answer is the same."   &gt;"Is that so..."   &gt;Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.   &gt;"Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;8 man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.  &gt;"Too sweet...   He lied to her. Iroha ship sinking.             Do you fags actually enjoy spending your time on this shit?  Nah, but for some reason I always ended up in this place anyway.       Now we're going back to ground zero in their scene with no proper conclusion. This is when informality becomes a huge issue. People are supporing either side both here and in 2ch because of Watari's way of writing that.        「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."  Shouldn't it be 「……嫌いじゃねぇけど...」or 「……嫌いじゃねぇ, けど...」 for that translation?     Pure love.   Which is superior, /a/?  Traps or tomboys?    Reverse traps  Tomboys &gt; traps  Bonus points for spats      So Tomboys then?     See the 2014 /a/ census. Tomboys beat all and traps are actually not that popular.     Tomboys because males are gross.      Tomboys   Girls with the worst part of being a girl removed by having the best parts of a fun male present    Traps   Penises with massive insecurities and hardly the best of either gender   Gee OP I dunno           No     Tomboy dominating traps is the only correct answer      ¿Por que no los dos?    Okay but what about both?  Tomboys  Traps are just girls for fags      Girls who look like girls &gt; girls who look like boys &gt; boys who look like girls         There can be only one.      Tomboys wearing strapons and dominating traps!     Tomboys are best   I think /a/'s definition of tomboy has become too wide.     Clearly you are not familiar with the character    Is this technically both?   I know the character, she might have the attitude, but not the looks.    I need a fucking doujin of that    I'd be fine with a teasing and cuddling doujin but fucking's fine too    She's a lesbian, not a tomboy.   Traps are only good for each other.    Draw a girl   Call it a boy   It is also straight       That's good too. I just want a lwed doujin of a tomboy and a trap.     http://fapservice.com/shishunki-na-<wbr>adam-light-novel-fanservice-compila<wbr>tion-vol-1-6/</wbr></wbr>   Absolutely wrong.     The hell are you talking about  Tomboy is all about the attitude        That's not even a trap  That's a semen demon      Tomboys are the personality of a guy in the body of a cute girl. Traps are the personality of a girl in the body of a cute guy.  It's clear which is superior.       bee   lesbian  what?  Also monkey is a lesbian and a tomboy.         what.          I would a trap but I would marry a tomboy.    I-I never watched past Bake and thought that was monkey, my bad Although I would still not consider monkey a tomboy because she still acts too feminine as a supporting character, leaning in on Araragi's arm while they walk and everything      She's not too feminine. She's just the right amount of feminine.    This is my all time favorite trap x tomboy / reverse trap couple.    You are wrong. Are you implying that all female characters that are athletic, like doing sports and are mostly interested in boy stuff are tomboys?  There are a lot of characters like that, doesn't mean they all are.       Best tomboy   Yes.  Also you're wrong.        Tomboys   They're not equivalent.  One is for closeted gays. The other is for faggots who are already out of the closet.    But which is which?      New chapter never     That is up to you to decide. Just trust your instincts.    This is the correct answer.      Persona 4 was great. It gave you a reverse trap and a tomboy.   do not forget best hermaphrodite   Did she have freckles in the anime? I didn't even notice.    Some traps act just like a tomboy because they look enough like a girl to be a tomboy    Tomboys are girls for fags.      I CANT DECIDE     <br/>     Genderbent characters aren't traps.    The one with more holes.    Well that helps, but the attitude is the most important part.     Tomboys are just fine, but traps will be always superior, even if the vocal minority says otherwise. Shota &gt;= traps &gt; damaged goods &gt; grills.     reverse trap tomboys     Shota &gt;= traps &gt; damaged goods &gt; grills.  This man knows what's up.      Beat Persona 4 Golden a few weeks ago   First time playing a Persona game, and first time playing a MegaTen game   Love Chie and her upbeat tomboyish attitude a cute appearance   Love Naoto and her calm, laid back demeanor and dat voice made of pure sex   Realize that it doesn't matter because fucking piece of shit Marie is the canon romance         futas   What if a tomboy fell in love with a trap?  Better yet, did we even have any series about this type of romance?     tomboys you sick dick craving fuck     Struggling to sauce these. Is the last one Adam in Puberty by any chance?      Literally what the link says fuckwit.     OP series is literally about a tomboy being pursued by two traps     Straight traps are awesome     Best tomboys wear spats  It is known    Since traps are literally homo, i'll go with the tomboy.   I'd show a picture of myself but that would be  /v/[/spoiler tier gayness  [Spoiler]not even trying to be a trap but I always get surprised reactions when people finds out I'm a guy        &gt;/lgbt/     K I want to see how this goes   Tomboys who want to be cute and girly are best    I still think this counts     Futas who act like traps or futas who act like tomboys?

I like gintama but this part was weird from the beginning and it is starting to appal me.     Must be horrible to be as retarded as you.    Maybe they'll do some omake related to the new op/ed to take up the extra time.    I hope so, the jokes would feel slow and redundant if they do one chapter per episode  Just look at Timestop arc      Yeah, the pacing for the first two episodes felt too slow. And they already added the whole conference thing.   About the new OP  Can we expect clues for future arcs?   Afuro at least?        Hopefully the excaliburs will appear in this OP.    No chance he'll be dead. Isaburo is not going to leave this arc alive though.   Next week, Hinowa teasing Tsukuyo about Gin.   I kinda want Isaburo to die so Nobume will go full edge like Kagura did   He was talking to Illumi, right?   Yes.    Yes.  Who was that random person in the background of the Heavens Arena arc who called out Killua's name?     I wonder how Illumi and Hisoka met.   Likes attract    Heavens Arena maybe? Since Killua was sent there as a child it might be a Zoldyck tradition and Hisoka seemed comfortable at the Heavens Arena.      yfw this cruel beast is a Floor Master when Heavens Arena is revisited      I still feel dirty for ever liking Wing. Never would have guessed that he's a pedophile.     manipulator   training to be a pure martial artist         It says "You're retarded"     Honestly he seems like an enhancer with how determined and single minded he is at training.    Hisoka said himself that the personality thing wasn't 100% reliable.    So then Killua isn't fickle and he still loves Gon they just need some time apart!   Has there been any info on Togashi since September or whenever he announced his hiatus?   No, Killua is legitimately, objectively and empirically a shit.    Killua sucks.     But if he doesn't still love him why'd he go through that trouble to save him, and why did he STILL feel the need to have Leorio and pals not tell Gon that it was Killua who saved him?     To hold it over Gon and make him feel guilty. He even said "you owe me" to him.    were that his goal he wouldn't have told them not to tell him      he just has autism anon, this is how he expresses his love    reminder that gon saved killua without expecting anything in return   How can anyone like this self-centered dumb drama queen faggot who doesn't realize his own mistakes and instead choses to blame others is beyond me.   Well before the CA arc is when he gets you, then you try to forgive everything in the late CA arc and election arc.    I don't blame people for their mental disabilities, he can't help being autistic.    Kawaii    they mistook his thoughts as actual narration, and never caught onto the fact that it was disconnected from what was actually happening    Characters without flaws are not interesting anon    under 5'2"   thug     It's because he's a flawed but well written character?    What?     same height as the 10 year old child on your team   gangsta       tfw taller than Feitan     Is that suppose to be impressive?    yes, because I'm 5'2 he's a fucking midge     best onisan    I want to  put  Feitan  in my pocket .    He's not quite. Maximum 4'10" for midgets.     tfw shorter than Feitan     I hope you're a girl. Otherwise holy shit, you're a fucking mega manlet.     Hisoka really is a bro even if he only chooses to be a bro to people he wants to murder in the future.    Not him, but /a/ does seem to have a lot of manlets, I'm 5'4", nothing wrong with being short though,  if you're gay  for all the /a/ manlets that aren't, sorry.     tfw gay and kind of want to be a manlet  not that I'm unhappy with my height     Yeah but Killuafags tend to ignore Killua's flaws.   Why do Kalluto and Alluka wear girl clothes? Did their mum desperately want a daughter? Is it a Zoldyck family tradition for everyone besides the heir? (I'm assuming not since we've seen Alluka and Kalluto in male clothing in the flashbacks but if so, did Illumi and Milluki wear girl clothes as small children?) Did Alluka start it because they wanted to be the little girl and Kalluto copied because he wanted Killua to love him?   Killua hate  I was going to say "Killua did nothing wrong" but I know he made a lot of mistakes. Like letting Gon delude himself, never telling him his true feelings and then getting upset because Gon isn't a mind-reader and so but eveybody is being too harsh on him. Seeing his best friend sacrifice himself, carring what's basically his corpse on his back and then see him wither away must have been a traumatic experience to Killua and just like Gon, he's only a 12 years old boy that went through a lot of shit.     I think the kalluto copying alluka one is most accurate    I think that its a backlash against the previous Gonhate. How many people thought that Gon was just being selfish, realizing that a character that they once thought of as an innocent victim wasn't so innocent after all. Part of this comes from reading the actual manga, which makes the difference in Killua's perspective and what's actually going on more obvious. The fact that Gon learns and actually and grows up, while Killua doesn't and even guilt trips Gon, just makes it even worse.  The fact that many Killuafags can't admit to his mistakes without trying to make excuses for him doesn't help.      But Anon, Alluka is a girl so of course she's going to dress like one    I'd just like to point out that Killua did change a lot and grow as a person from the first arc where we see him, but still has to grow.    I miss edgy Killua. He was fun.    Would old Killua be reluctant about killing Pitou right there? Probably not.    While Killua has changed a lot since his first appearance, he hasn't learned anything from the CA arc.     because I'm 5'2  Damn     Killua has too many flaws and not enough likeable traits.    Most if not all characters in HxH are flawed. It doesn't justify Killua's popularity.    leorio will never carry his own arc     implying he won't have his own character arc in the DC     I kinda think that that's Leorio's appeal, that in a world full of increasingly stronger superthreats he's just a guy with a good head on his shoulders who wants to do the right thing.   I'm also guessing the Japs don't like him because he's not the typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon) or at least somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)       in a world full of increasingly stronger superthreats   typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon)   somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)      Will this be AOTS or AOTY?  Too short  I rarely see discussions about Manwha, so I decided to make a little thread it.  I'll start by posting the whore that has pissed me off more than Enju from Dice.    Want a godlike manwha? Go read Shin Angyo Onshi.  gook shit is not /a/ related   So where should we talk about it? Most manga sites have manwha anyways.    Not anime or manga  Dice is the best webtoon.   U misspelled red storm   Anon, would you a ho?  manhwa is horrible. I absolutely hate the current flood of shitty manhwa comics that are more akin to western comics than to manga. They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent. Don't even get me started on chinese ''manga'' which is so bad it makes me wonder if the chinese are invested with any modicum of creativity, if at all.  Stop appropriating Japanese art culture you sub-human gooks no one likes your shit.     It's should be /a/   Because Manhua and Manhwa is literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively. Just like how you don't differentiate between Onee-chan and Sister normally. Anyway I've never seen a janitor 404 a manhua thread yet, not that they usually last very long.       They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent  So, nothing different from manga, then?     This    Ouch, that hurts.    anywhere but here    Tower of god is great, what I don't like is the lame clothes of the character there.      GET THE FUCK OUT OF /A/ YOU GOOKS ! GO READ YOUR SUB-PAR STUPID WEBCOMICS ELSEWHERE      It's hard to take "badass" character seriously when they look like skater punks.   I like manhwa and I read them from time to time, but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters? While the stories are not bad, they tend to drag it so fucking much it gets me fucking angtsy and I just read the wiki. Tower of God, dice, and Girls of the wild and 3 big examples of mad dragging.  Jack Frost is best manhwa.  Daily reminder that The Breaker's team are the biggest bitches in the manwha industry.  Post the zombie hunters.     tower of god   girl backstabbing best boy    we learn that her only motivation is just to watch stars   wtfamireading.jpg       subhuman shit   Fuck off.     Possible 1-2 year hiatus. Why do they do this to us.   Is there something wrong with  Godoka sites?  I am getting ssl_error_rx_record_too_long  Also did you guys read some Chinese Manhwa like Long Hu Men? It didn't have a nice story but still enjoyable.      Just like anything, majority of them are total shit. There's definitely great hidden gems, though most are untranslated.  Gook shit is usually abysmal with a few exceptions, but Tower of god is indeed really good.   I read Chinese Manhua to see them throw sparkly things at each other and shout their moves which can destroy planets and stuff. Most of them are more Dragon ball than Dragon ball and 10x as ridiculous.   Rak is best boy.    I rarely see discussions about Manwha  They happen occasionally. Sometimes they last long. But no one wants to put up with the "lel, gook shit doesn't belong in /a/" despite evidence to the contrary.  Anyways, that reminds me that I haven't read the last two or so chapters of ToG. Also, when was The Gamer supposed to start back up?   Slut. Almost as shit as Rachel.             but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters?  Honestly, who knows? I can only assume they're trying to copy some of the larger manga.  Tower of God makes sense to be fuck long, because of the nature of its story, but Girls of the Wild should have ended ages ago. I pretty much dropped it around the time the shut-in brother was introduced, and I don't know what I even read it that far. Is it seriously still going?       Mod already said it's allowed long time ago, back when /q/ was around. Still won't change people bickering about it though.    Cat girl won. He claimed MC with a kiss and telling him, 'Remember what I said the first time we met? YOU'RE MINE'.     Cat girl won  I do not mind this, actually. Rich girl seemed kind of bland, but the story seemed to be pinning them together. Did he seriously end up with cat girl, or did she just steal a kiss?      All the 'manhwa' you listed are webcomics which run weekly, and 5 years of runtime really isn't that long.  To compensate for the increased workload, they need to fill the comic up with fillers, which is why when you marathon some parts will feel heavily dragged on.      tfw Priest will never get an ending  That movie didn't make things better either.    She stole it, Queen will win because she is the queen.   It's not anime or manga   no 10th dimensional boys anymore     bam finally catches up to rachel   they finally get to talk   she fucking pushes him down again  What the fuck man. Dude just what the fuck.        She truly deserves to rot alone just for the sake of watching stars.    While I don't really follow the newest chapter of Tog but I think that Baam is too clingy, reminds me of Mikasa relationship with Eren.    He seriously had it coming. Did he not see that see that coming? Holy fuck, but it was funny.      I hope to god that Baam finally learned his lesson but considering the retard he is, he probably didn't.  I just want him to be happy with androssi or the pink flame girl, xiaxia, whoever.  Just forget about the whore and climb the tower peacefully until FUG comes to ruin it again.        So what do people think about this? I thought it was pretty interesting to be honest. The story could have been done better, and there's too much left unexplained, but it's still nice to read.    It's pretty damn bad lately. but even ToG or Breaker had a time when they were somewhat interesting before. I don't know what the fuck they were doing to fuck it up like this.  SAO, Ares, The Breaker and maybe Which Hunter, there used to be a time when i thought the koreans might have some potential in the future. But then Webtoons came along. That format killed every ounce of talent they could have had.  And manhua will probably never get good for me. there is just something fundamentally different about the way they tell their stories.       Shouldn't this be in /co/?  Does baam get pushed before or after the time skip?    Everyone is still hoping that Baam will finally grow a spine and grow up but then he would have no major motivation to climb the tower.  And that's a major problem for SIU, he litetally wrote Baam in to be ultra dependent on Rachel.   That and SIU loves Rachel so there's no way he'd kill her off easy. Fuck man.         Both.    No, this isn't a hollywood super hero movie or show.    Both.     Both. The dumb fuck got pushed twice and from the looks of it he still hasn't learned his lesson.  Fuck you SIU        SIU loves Rachel  Seriously? Or is that just your conclusion based on how the story treats her?   That said, there's always the possibility SIU will flip-flop, and turn Rachel into an ally.        it ain't manga either    It would be unrealistic at this point to have Bam NOT be clingy to Rachel. His entire life up to that point revolved around one single person, and only on the occasion that she would visit him in that cave. So in between all of that dark shit loneliness, there was a light that would visit him once and a while.   So I think it's a natural response that not only is he clingy to her still, but he wants to know why she betrayed him. Plus without her he has little actual motivation to climb the tower at all.     I really liked Afterschool War Activities. I think it would make into a nice live TV series (a Korean one).   There's this one post from a mod you see every other manhwa thread. It basically asks the same question you ask, but the mod confirms that it's fine here. I'm sure someone will post it.    Its read left to right and colored, looks like /co/      Men can be dumb when they are clingy, I bet you'll do the same if you were dying and alone, and found yourself someone to connect with.     Doulou Dalu is best webcomic    After the ending of season one, he did a Q&amp;A on naver and when he was asked who his favorite character was he responded with Rachel.  He dislikes Koon the most because Koon is a smart character type and has to think hard for Koon's plans and dialogue .      Technically this is not a question aimed towards manwha alone, but all manga in general. Do you guys get huge autism and suddenly drop translated chapters if they only come in two pages online?  I have dropped decent series because of this. My autism goes to new levels when I try to read two paged manga online and make me stop reading.    NEX DID NOTHING WRONG    there are people who haven't read korean berserk yet  holy shit, how doesn't everyone know this series yet?     Its corean    Mods have said it goes in /a/ before, as it's Korean. Until a mod says otherwise, it does in /a/. We point this out nearly every thread.    I bet you'll do the same if you were dying and alone, and found yourself someone to connect with.  Doesn't mean we have to like a character just because his upbringing was shit.       korean webcomice have almost no standards for story or art.  i wish they weren't listed on MU. same with chinese novels. fuck them     I heard that the manhwa version made it too kid friendly because it was obviously aimed for them compared to the more adult novel version.  Go read the novel version       Obviously it's his favorite character, she's fucking dumb as fuck. Goes all edgelord and shit, and backstab her closest friend, why? Because she wants to fucking go watch motherfucking stars in the top. She can choke on those motherfucking stars all she wants, like holy fuck how stupid can you be, sometimes I think the author just wants to make her autistic. Like how can't you understand people relationships, and why the fuck do you then get jealous because Baam has more friends now.  Complete garbage. This pisses me off than watching NTR hentai.      Yes, I understand his in-character to be a clingy man. I loved Baam's monologue about Rachel too. It felt so strong compared to any mango I read.    wait they made a webcomic for that? shit, i've just been reading the raws, is it on batoto or am i gonna actually hunt for it?     I just wish they weren't so terribly colored, or shaded. Or whatever the fuck they call that art style     chinese novels  Fuck Wuxia/Xianxia, the whole genre is garbage.     Nah, shit pretending-to be-deep-edgy series.     Mods have said it goes in /a/ before  Nobody cares what /co/'s nigger mods have to say.     I've heard something similar. The Tofu guy in the webtoon actually had sausage powers in the novel, and the dick jokes were replaced by "bad smell" jokes.    I mean, I agree to a degree that her betraying him just to look at starts is stupid, but I think you're thinking about it in a pretty short sighted way. We don't know anything about her motivations yet at all.  You're making the assumption that she betrayed him for the most shallowest of reasons. I'm going to give SIU the benefit of the doubt and say that we don't yet know her real intentions.     Yeah, I'm up to date with the novel I just like how fun the manhwa is    Because /co/ a shit   I've stopped following ToG a few years ago. Baam is still gary stu as fuck?    Go look on mangacow for chapters up to 80 ish.  Mangacow gave up translating it and some other group is now.  Or you could read the translated novel chapters.         I remember one chapter when she was having her bullshit star dreams she only talks about, and only woke up because she saw Baam been taken over her new friends and got buttmad.  The fuck?      Just ignore those newfag. Just by lurking they will understand what is allowed and what is not.     gary stu as fuck?   He was just overleveled post-timeskip from all the grinding.      How in the fuck is Baam a gary stu? Guy had a horrible life and the one person that he likes keep trying to teach him as fly in the hard way.    I love manwha more than manga lately  Hngg Dice  mfw there will never be an anime        She's apparently scared of Baam. Or scared of the dark/night. Probably both, seeing how Baam's name means "night". And of course Rachel's name means "Light".     Do you enjoy the autistic female lead? I sure don't.  muh perfect school life   fucking dice        It's been butchered to be kid friendly.     Yeah. But you have to understand that the character he is given is meant to be a gary stu. Irregulars and what not. Like fucking onii-sama.  Ohh shit. I forgot about that. Okay, I'm still going to hope that theres more to it than just her getting all butt hurt over him have friends.  He's a total gary stu man. Almost everyone who meets him eventually likes him. SIU stopped killing characters and most people live and become part of the team now. Bams whole character literally revolves around being stronger than everyone else, it's what an irregular is meant to be. His latent ability is literally copying everyone elses moves and then doing it better.         forgot pic   The hatred towards Rachel will only intensify or lessen depending on the author. I remember every comment of the chapters i was reading, shitting on lizard girl, and now it's less since we got the backstory. That being said, it all depends on how the author wants to write her backstory. It's obvious that the author of Tower of God is just stalling because he doesn't know how to validate a bullshit reason like going watch stars as something strong enough to make her such a shit person.    He's loved or liked by everyone he comes around and has so many shit going on for him it's not funny. He's an irregular with OP ability to resist shinsoo and absorb all techniques, trained by FUG, has a Thorn and was able to scratch the strongest man in the Tower while being a complete newfriend. He also has a nice personality on top of it and whole harem of girl wanting his D including a princess of the tower. By the end of series he will unironically approach or surpass the level of madara uchiha copypasta. Tell me that he's not a gary stu.     You don't know what gary-stu mean.   I just want half of the cast to die. I'm not being edgy or anything, it's just that it's too much. SIU is being a pussy with every character he introduces and the cast will eventually become Nartuo tier where there are too many people, and not enough time to spend on each and every one of them.  He's making everyone join their damn team too. Just get rid of half of the new cast and throw out some of the old team too. It would make the chapters a little more exciting as well if there was some death.    what the fuck happened to madokami.  it still worked yesterday    His skill/ability is Gary Stuish. His life is a bit because suddenly those daughter of Zahhard loved him, those whatever stronk faction want to use him, only Rachel despises him.    <br/>    I was really expecting for Baam to destroy the train while he was falling again, but what? He fainted or something?     literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively  Which is actually surprising considering how many drastic changes the medium took over the last how many decades and how many authors thought whatever the were doing wasn't manga anymore. See A Drifting Life. The history of the term is actually way more complicated than anyone ever seems to think.   Traditionally made manhwa is a hell of a lot better than the cheaply done and mass produced webtoons they do these days. Which is actually a real damn shame. Webtoon format is pretty awful, and few use it well (and not enough close enough to not feel like it's completely for accomodating mobile devices and destroying any semblance of technique in panelling. Basically screw Tezuka.) They're not all completely awful, but they're probably more derivative than shitty shounen manga and the fact they didn't go through the same evolution or time span like manga speaks volumes for the quality. Where are their Otomo or Tezuka?        and was able to scratch the strongest man in the Tower  Wrong, he is the 4th. Baam scratching him or even surviving that hit was really retarded, but is just a case of shit writing.    Can Baam defeat Servants?    She wants to see the stars because she wants to be the main character of a fairy tale, just like that story she liked.  She she's legitimately scared of Baam because he's the one who opened the door to the tower and has the traits of an irregular.  Even headon said that she wasn't meant to be in the tower and only gave her a chance after making a deal with her.  Baam is a nuisance to her and she fears him.            shitting on lizard girl  People hated Anak before her backstory?   he doesn't know how to validate a bullshit reason like going watch stars as something strong enough to make her such a shit person.  It kinda seems like she WANTS him to climb the tower in these last couple chapters.    By the end of series he will unironically approach or surpass the level of madara uchiha copypasta  And then we'll have a new copypasta to shitpost.            To be honest its been about 2 years since I read ToG. You might be right.   Kamisama has hiccups all the damn time. Give it a day and itll probably be fixed.       Are we talking about Thorn-powered Baam who mastered the Supreme King's Scorching Fist of Death?    Nigga did you see how big that train was? I don't remember how long, but they've already been on the train for a couple of months and Rachels crew aren't even close to the front.    So upon meeting Baam constantly, Rachel is not scared of him?    How strong is that Supreme King's Scorching Fist of Death?   Hwa Ryun best girl.    Baam is essentially a mage that can copy your attack and use it better than you.  In addition to at least having a Saber class's strength and Rider's speed when he goes all out.  He's broken as fuck.         My nigga    Is Baam hypersonic?    This is almost word for word the current status of manga.    I hope you enjoyed their new announcement, although the bitches complaining might have overturned it somewhat. They were going to stop novels being added anymore and focus again on manga.    He has at least one movement technique that allows him to go fast.   Androssi best girl. Fuck that Rachel slut.     and use it better than you  Since when? The move he copies from Mazino (or however you spell that guy's name) I don't believe was even close to the same level. He still has to practice, even if only less.       She's scared of him but she knows that Baam doesn't have the balls to kill her.  She wants to be main character of her own story as she climbs the tower to see the stars, but every time she climbs up, a dark shadow called Baam reminds her that it isn't her story and that she is a fake.  Every time Baam meets her she is reminded that he is the chosen irregular and that she only got in becsuse she begged for a deal from headon.         No, it isn't, you're full of shit.     Androssi   not a slut  Hwa Ryun is the only true best girl.      How fast, exactly?    You're right, it's more akin to LNs.     Androssi   a slut  She's one of those virgins who pretend to be experienced, but doesn't know shit.  She'd be killed just for touching a dick.         SIU did call her the most beautiful girl in the cast and that beauty will play a large role in the future.      implying she will ever  She's probably to afraid of getting killed like the Gekko girl mother. She has to remain perma-virgin.   Wasted goods.       I've stopped following ToG a while ago, is her motivation at least somewhat clear now or she's still hiding everything about herself?    Too bad she's dead weight. She can't do anything other than look pretty and guide.   Baam will change the order in tower and impregnate everyone. Racher will be degraded into breeding sow.   I believe in him      To put in short terms, he can outrun people of his own level.  If you and Baam were of the same level, he could outrun you.  Nonetheless, there a bigger monsters than can instakill Baam if they wanted to.          I don't know.The one thing that's stopping me from getting into it is that the names sound too strange.  The nouns are all "syoong" "blook" "schlorp", it sounds like the frogpeople from fucking Rlyeh are trying to speak.        her class is guide   can't do anything but guide  anon.      She seems willing to break that rule for Baam, so I guess you just have to get her wet enough to not mind dying.   No, Hwa Ryun's motives are still completely unexplained, beyond the usual FUG "We want you to become our God".        She's still hiding her motives but it involves Baam doing something for her when he becomes powerful enough.  That and just teasing him/ being half serious when she calls him her God.       Answer the fucking question, you claimed that he was faster than Rider, back your claim.     She was skilled enough to handle some average regulars, but her main job is to be pretty and be a fucking guide.    WHERE THE FUCK IS THE NEW CHAPTER OF CAVALIER OF THE ABYSS?  If Baam can copy other people ability, is he kinda the same as medaka minus 20-30% of the abilites he didn't fully mastered    I'm only interested in the rape so there isn't much to discuss.      If Rider and Baam had the same rank speed (A+), Baam would be able to outrun Rider.  If rider used her mount, Baam would eat shit. He isn't that fast with his technique.       Not that anon, but Baam is a genius; if he sees someone use a technique for moving at super-sonic speeds, he can probably copy it on the fly. That's been his gimmick since "season 2".  That said, he can move fast enough to catch a ball at extremely high speeds. (Though he preferred to just freeze the ball in place)      /co/ is that way -------------------------&gt;   Girls d th wilds man. What a piece of shit. Dropped i think 4 chapters after MC kicked the bully's ass. After that i felt the creator had no idea the fuck he was doing.  My biggest gripe with ToG writing is these shitty games that are introduced every couple of chapters. There's always like a shit load of exposition and it's completely useless. That last game with the angry ball thing was pointless.  how mad were you during this moment    if he sees someone use a technique   technique  Yes, a technique, servants have hypersonic speed as base status, and a NP isn't a technique.         Even if he did copy it, he would be able to use as well as them  Granted, the fucker learns very fast, he would still need time to practice.       You mean mad at the last moment this shit was actually any good?   FUG is a pretty bad name. Does it stand for something? I forgot. How do you pronounce it? Like each letter separated, eff you gee? Or literally all together, fug.      that moment in second part when Rachel cuts the legs of runner guy    They are just finnish.     Aye, Rider is naturally fast because of her stats but so is Baam.  Baam in one of the most recent chapters jumped several thousand feet in seconds to put things into perspective.  In a fight without noble phantasm, Baam has the bigger chance of winning, but rider uses her NP's he's done for.         Dude this series is so sad. The ending was shit.    All we know is from her own words. FUG hold a grudge against the families, Zahard and those who envy their possessions which is why they want to change the tower. A Slayer of FUG is someone who is intended to kill Zahard and regarded as a God by the Organization. And Hwa Ryun regarded Baam (A Slayer) as HER God.   Her point is being a highly important plot piece. Evan was in utter shock seeing her and it's confirmed those two don't even know each other.  She's subject of countless theories cause it's been made clear something is up with her like people thinking she's Headon.               It's should be /a/ because Manhua and Manhwa is literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively   That's not a reason. Manga is literally just Japanese comics. "Japanese comics except Chinese" are not Japanese comics.      Wouldn't you count the Thorn as a Noble Phantasm in this scenario though? Wasn't that what even allowed him to jump that height?   No seriously, why do Manhwa names sound like frog people trying to speak?   Can Baam kill Gil? Wouldn't Baam get fucked?     I was pissed as fuck. I'm glad he's able to run again but SIU is being too nice to his characters.     Because its corean    Nope.Though it's probably a shortcut. The founder is called Grace.      Seoung Gyool Bloop and whatnot.     It's Finland. Who the fuck knows.       I didn't consider it a NP because it is becoming a part of him rather than a weapon.  But if we consider the thorn an NP, he's fucked.       As he is now, he will. But when he climbs all the way to the top and becomes Phantaminum-tier in power who is able to bend rules of reality around him? Gil will get fucked really hard even if he pulls out all his top tier shit, it's like comparing Gil and Aristoteles.     https://www.tumblr.com http://www.deviantart.com      Not a fucking chance. Baam would die due to GoB spam.  The only way he would survive is he could spam magic bolts(shinsu blasts) fast enough to match Gil.  He doesn't have enough bangs for that.  He would needs hundreds of bangs for that.          <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111543  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111773  For a few minutes there I thought you were dead    I'm pretty proud of this thread, no one responded to the bait the shitposter keeps on posting.  Good job guys, now if only a janitor or mod could come here and clean up.     Gook here. It's because most of the common vowels don't have a 1:1 correspondence with English vowels and consonants, so you get really awkward clusters like eo, ae, eu, kk, gk, and so forth which would confuse the fuck out of foreigners, even though they're actually quite simple to pronounce once you know how it's supposed to sound.  On the otherhand, Japanese phonology is far more simple, and so are their vowels, which romanize neatly for the most part (ex. sushi).  tl;dr The latin alphabet is just a piss-poor tool to represent common Korean vowels.        SIU will have his hand fall off before he finishes this damn series. He says ToG is just the start, and he wants several other series to be in the same world all culminating together or some shit after this.  He's already gone to the hospital or something because he has wrist problems. It's taken him how many years already to get this far in ToG?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111773   or /b/  I get that you're technically correct, but no one's going to take any sort of discussion topic to /b/. /co/ ought to be where this belongs - if the mods there actually have banned it, then people interested in it should lodge a complaint and see if anything happens, because it clearly isn't /a/ material.     Baam will never become Phantaminum-tier, author already said that Red Tower possible won't even appear because he is too broken. Phantaminum is much above him and just not beatable, by anyone showed so far, thanks to his race/status.    You weren't wrong.    Who is phantaminum again? Wasn't he only mentioned once in the whole story thus far?     We've discussed this before, mods allowed Korean manhwa, true enough these are Korean webtoons, or online korean comics.  We need a moderator to finally put the issue at rest as to whether Korean webtoons are permissible here.  Someone summon a mod in here to finish this once and for all.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111773   people have always talked about korean manhwa here before. you newfags really need to stop trying so hard.  even i can admit that they're pretty damn shit these days. but then just call them shit if they're shit. nobody needs these meme posts.       Rank 1, guy that raided Zahard's palace or something like that, killed almost everyone there and they didn't even manage to scratch him.    Is there any correlation between being an irregular and becoming an Axis? Baam is always insanely broken compared to the people on the same floor as he is, hell he was able to survive an attack from a guy who is only a few ranks lower than Phantaminum. I won't be surprised if he becomes an Axis user himself at the end of series, and it's even more broken than Aristoteles.     <br/>   Whether or not the mods says it's ok, won't stop people from shitting on it. People spent years dubspamming Naruto and they only let up because of N/a/ruto and the eventual demise of the series (although I don't know how well that reflects the current situation with the new series).   And people have shit on them since forever. People used to like Shin Angyo Onshi, The Breaker (the original) and Veritas, but the anti-TOG brigades were excellent back in their day.      Is anyone reading Magician? Is it worth picking up or it's dragged for too long? I've heard it was running on snail's pace for ages.     He's the god of the story, and he decides who lives and who dies. No can match him, not even irregulars.  He is the author writing the story of ToG basically.  And there are stronger gods than him, each gods of their own worlds/universes.         Not really, Zahard, Red Tower and Mazino are all irregulars and they aren't Axis.   ToG was really good until it became about friendship. Part 1 was amazing.   No. 1 in the Ranking. He utterly decimated everyone who came into his way including the most elite Rankers and Zahards strongest men which started the irregular stereotype. It's confirmed he's an Axis with the power to influence and manipulate the plot itself. According to SIU, he came from outside the tower where many Axis exist as Tower of God is just a part of the Talse Uzer Universe.       It always was about friendship and betrayal. Author just doesn't like to kill his characters and that is kinda bad for a manhwa like this, but there were excellent bits in second part like Rachel cutting the sanic guy so he will never be able to go fast again.     we might as well allow shit like avatar, wakfu, and rwby here too  fuck off       He got soft is what happened, people actually died in Season 1 as to season 2 where only the major bad guy died.     Part 1 was much darker than the later bits. I mentally gave up when he befriended Beta and stopped reading just before they got on the train. It went from a fairly gritty seinen to a serialized shounen in tone. Retarded.    Nah.Phantaminum was just the first irregular who's actions are why irregulars are received the way they are. Not all are Axis, he just gave them a bad rep by storming into the Tower and obliterating everything in his path.      just before they got on the train  Last time I checked, they hadn't done that yet.    What is Kumiko saying to Shu1?    i also masturbated to you before    She admitting that she will never get the part down.   That's actually Reina talking to Shu1 in that shot.   In the name of St. Kaori.   I'm a gay homosexual lesbian and Reina is my girlfriend    Died for all our  Reina's  sins    tfw can't sleep because Midori is just too cute.   Send help    Nothing. Reina caught Shuichi talking shit about Taki Sensei, and Kumiko is now looking at her.     The patron saint of talentless hacks.      She's my favourite background character.  Praise kyoani for cute background waifus.      umaku naritai     When does it get good, you faggots lied to me    Have all of you taken your daily time to thanks KyoAni?   She deserves more screen time.     You guys must be fun at parties.     Show me your bussy    I'll fight you fagott.      I wish the anime went over the reason why she considered backing Kaori in the audition. Both she and Hazuki are given such little screentime as it is, it's unfortunate when good scenes that they do have get cut.  But maybe KyoAni's just saving the scene for something else.     Don't talk about Taki-Sensei in front of the crazy bitch, she almost killed me last time I did.   I want to be almost killed by Reina.    Hey, did you know Satoshi saw your dick?     At this point im wondering what her purpose even is. What does she and Hazuki do in the later novels?    realisticfag gtfo pls    Can you blame him? He was  __gay__.      I wish the anime went over the reason why she considered backing Kaori in the audition.  But they did. Are you actually watching the show?    ITT underrated grils               Ayaya pls      Bad personalities even if justified in part, delicious nonetheless.     Everyone seems to have hated her but I thought she was best girl     I read this as ITT under-aged girls        Chamber best girl.     I'm glad she won  My waifu. Always gets overshadowed by azusa and Mio    mugi   underrated  Isn't like 3/4 of /a/ like mugi?      Why is Chamber so perfect? I have spent a lot of time trying to find a flaw, and I can't find one.    Nah, more people seem to prefer Azusa and Mio, with a few really autistic Ritsufags thrown in there      MY NIGGER        If I take off that fang will she die?    If you take it off she becomes sexually aroused and seduces ayaya   I read the thread as underage girls   wrong wrong wrong wrong you must mean akira   people forget rice so often.... ;;   She was annoying as fuck, anime would be a lot better withou her.     I don't understand how people didn't like her. I can really relate to her love of Mashiro.    :^)   AMPAN   She's the best class rep assassin of all time   Actually you kinda right, but Eto is not even popular like her in nip land    Montmorency!~~   If the series had been a bit more popular, the ending might not have been such a rush job.  I would Lucky her Star   My nignog     liking used goods       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w9M<wbr>4mTV67sw</wbr>  [ ]  Why is she so cute     I have her Nendo along with Kokomi on PO.   Chisato a shit.    cockblocked any romance advance    I self inserted as mashiro because of her.  You will never be a loli and molested by her       This faggot     everyone forgets the princess    She was just protecting her imouto.   A recent one.   9 days   9 volumes   Tonight, we do Kirio's arc. Well, at least Mayuko's there I guess.              Dies anyone actually care about Kirio?    Stupid Boruto, I'm going to be the next Hokage    Whether or not Sakura gave birth to Salad, she took care of her all her life. Sakura is undisputably Salad's mom, the only question is if she's her only mom.    Thank you, anon for getting my point. It was getting tiring arguing with that faggot.    The point is Hinata clearly can't control Bolt's wiles. What a shitty mother.    You're retarded. First of all, there are at least like 50 of us for some reason, and my mom is Bender's mom for some reason. So the POINT is that nobody can control anything, and if you thought you were controlling something you were very, very mistaken    Strength comes through adversity and hard work!  Oh wait this is Naruto, no it doesnt   </blockquote>]
