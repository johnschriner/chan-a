[  you will never ride with your Robot waifu to a party   Why is Dragon Ball Super retreading the plot of the movie? Since when has the anime ever refrenced a movie other than that one filler with Garlic Jr?  weis mentioning him being the fastest in the universe but he spends 26 minutes to travel to king kais when goku can instant transmission  <br>flying is overrated.</br>  Why do they keep ruining the Frieza saga? <br><br>The conflict between Frieza and the Saiyans was so interesting because a mighty emperor was afraid of people he considered to be inferior creatures. It also illustrated the great potential of the Saiyan race. <br><br>In RoF, we learn that Frieza never had a good reason to be afraid of them because he can get a lot stronger by just training a little. <br><br>In Super, we learn that Frieza destroyed planet Vegeta because Beerus ordered him to do it. <br><br>Hence, Vegeta's theory that Frieza was afraid of the Saiyans turns out to be wrong and the conflict in the Frieza arc is a lot less interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because the movie was popular and Tori is too lazy too come up with new stuff.</br></br>   ITT: Draw an Animu Character as vaguely as possible and let others guess who is he <br><br>I'l start.</br></br>  <br>for FUCKS sake</br>  <br>A pickle fucking a veggie</br>  <br>A girl sitting down or tow elbows hitting each other.</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>Piccolo &amp; Gohan?<br><br><br>I fucked up the colours.</br></br></br></br>  Well shit, I guess I like fugoshi shows now. <br><br>Anyone else watching Gangsta?</br></br>  fug  <br>Stuff and non-sense.</br>  Good to see some hardcore characters again  <br>Nips use German finger counting?</br>  <br> Anime doesn't have little girls and pedo bait running around <br><br>"HUUR DURR IT'S A FUJOSHI SHOW"<br><br>Just kill yourself. It will only make the world a better place</br></br></br></br></br>  Just a reminder that a new chapter of little brown girl wife was released today.  Thanks, that was a fun chapter.  thanks for reminding me op<br><br>best brown loli</br></br>  This is adorable. I wonder where she's from, her clothing and items seem to be native American like.  manga's too comfy, and there's a lot of really subtle sensual panels. <br><br>oh god, why are there only 6 chapters???</br></br>  Wow this is adorable.  My prince.   war elephants   Why aren't you doing RPG builds/Grand Strategy playthroughs based on the show/LNs right now?  <br>Because I'm not a nerd.</br>  <br> dat bulge </br>    Why does this manga get special treatment compared to other popular shounen manga? I see people shit all over One Piece, etc. yet FMA is always held up on some kind of pedestal. What does it do differently?  <br> original theme, a boy with fully mechanical limb <br>Berserk did it before though</br></br>  I like One Piece and like FMA<br><br>but the differences between them is obvious. HxH has more in common with your average shounen than FMA.</br></br>  <br><br>Not that anon, but Berserk isn't really a shounen series.<br><br>Also, for the time it was still unique enough to be interesting, even if it wasn't the first ever to think of the idea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure that trope is older than Bersek.<br>It's not original but not overused, especially in shonens.</br></br>  <br> HxH has more in common with your average shounen than FMA <br>How so?</br></br>  Why didn't they just call this Circle Jerk - The Anime?<br><br>I'm getting tired of all the dick sucking in this show.</br></br>  <br> shittting on the glorious name of AINZ OAAL OWN <br> Somebody slap this bitch</br></br>  <br> Ah but is it going to see him become more human at some point or die trying to hold on to his humanity?  <br><br>well, most likely his humanity will be completely gone.<br><br>or the mystery of who is actually in charge of it all happening? is the point of the story to find out the "how" and "what" of the plot or any big twists? <br><br>Not yet, but I should read all the novels first, so I wouldnt know much either<br><br>  just that i wanted to confirm how the demon girl and the main character being in a demon body would play and work out <br><br>Well, about that<br><br>Papa Bones considers all the NPCs his kids as he and his guild players created them. So he is 'daughter-zoning' that girl. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128325371#p128337927">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get the name right you lowly serf.</br>  <br>I'm sorry but its not that i meant that it NEEDED romance no, I only thought that from seeing ep1 of the anime I was taking guess's at how they will deal with a human being trapped in such a body and a women that loves him only getting smarter and more real for him. And since im planning on reading it I wanted to know if it went down that route and how depressing it got or serious. but it seems its more about him becoming some sort of lich king losing his human side. ok I got that.<br><br>Also is it shounen power levels crap? and does he have plot armor? this is important because im not gonna read that if its at least not a bit more serious in the mystery side of whats happened to him and taking into account how he deals with being trapped in such a body.</br></br></br>  <br>Things will always be lost in translations, especially if you it's done multiple times (JP&gt;CN&gt;EN).
