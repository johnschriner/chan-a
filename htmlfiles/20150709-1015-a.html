[ Is Might Dai is only manly ninja in Naruto?  <br>yes it is and i still dont understand why rock lee didnt have his family shown to the public</br>  its coming..<br>any episode now.....</br>    <br>The Raikage ain't too bad.</br>  <br><br>There's also Jiraiya.</br></br>  <br>I liked him better when he was Master Roshi.</br>  Oh shit, the anime got to that part ? Might start watching it now, it's been years.<br><br>I wanna see that fight. Gotta say they are pretty fucking slow, though. Heard they were doing fillers and stuff, but why? It's fucking retarded, the manga is done.</br></br>  <br>Probably have to do fillers so they can wrap up PAST fillers they did. Fuck knows, Naruto is lousy with them.</br>  <br>Aside from some early tidbits Roshi was always far more of a straight-up comic relief character rather than a genuine master, even when serious maintaining a goofy MO. Certainly not a grand/god father figure to the MC.<br>Jiraiya has his lecherous and hedonistic side, sure, but when he's serious he's serious.<br>Or so I recall, it's been ages since I actually got anything on either character.</br></br></br>  <br>If they cared about filler stuff they've set up they would not have blueballed the audience with the Exam Arc one they had a while ago.</br>  <br>What Exam Arc are you talking about?</br>  <br>They did a filler arc about everyone but Naruto getting promoted in one exam as participation awards (Neji getting a double promotion to Juunin because he kinda saved the Kazekage), most of them doing nothing but jobbing against OC characters.<br>They outright killed the thing before stage 3 and any real one on one fights between characters people might have given a shit about couls have happened, and a big assassination plot they set up for half the filler ended with Gaara talking the leader into committing Sudoku.</br></br>  <br>Dang. I would've really liked watching a second Chuunin Exam with more grown-up characters.<br><br>If they're going to do fillers, at least make them filling.</br></br></br>  Speaking of the Chuunin Exam, Sakura is a full-on retard for not speaking up about Sasuke's curse seal when she had the chance, in front of not only the Hokage, but top-tier Jonin like Kakashi and Might Guy. Even if she didn't speak out but had a quiet chat to the Hokage or Kakashi on the side straight after.<br><br>I can't believe the terrible choices people make in this series.</br></br>  <br>The basic idea was fairly good. Apparently they wanted to do something along the lines of it since the filler hell, but it was vetoed in case Kishi or someone wants to make some proper stories about that.<br>After the Hyuuga sisters filler episodes I actually was expecting something half-decent, since that had good characterisation, some good animation and expanded on underused characters.<br><br>The exam filler started okay, with a test devised by Shikamaru and overseen by him and Temari, but dragged on too long. Then you had some dull political shit inserted into it when there was no need, and the whole thing culminated in a slog in a boring desert. I was looking forward to at least some neat fights in Stage 3 between supporting cast when the powerlevels were not yet ridiculous, and got nothing.<br>There was also some massive missed potential that I didn't really expect, but wanted nonetheless.<br> mixed designs somewhere between pre- and post-timeskip - nope <br> Shino meeting Fuu - nope <br> charcters actually taking charge and showing growth, maybe using actual tactics - nope <br> good teamwork in teams that by this point have been working together for years - nope </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kakashi knew about it, he fucking sealed that shit.</br>  <br>Bitch, what d'you think the Third Raikage was, some kinda bitch nigga? Fuck you.</br>  <br>What's worse is that she didn't point out that someone who looked extremely similar to the fellow who put the damn thing on Sausage was right fucking there.<br>Naruto and Sasuke I can sort of understand as they were actually doing fighting, not staring out of their heads, one scared shitless and the other dealing with the demon fox chakra, but she really should have mentioned that bit.<br>Of course the Third, Anko, the ANBU and Kakashi should have gotten the clue themselves, but Sakura too should have pointed out that little extra, useful info.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm reading that chapter right now. Fucking EVERYONE knew about it. Kakashi, the Hokage, Anko, the referee, EVERYONE. And they're like "We should probably pull him out of the content now.", but the Hokage got all antsy because Orochimaru gave a vaguely threatening spiel to Anko about destroying the Village, even though that's his plan no matter what happened in the exam.<br><br><br>Final exam is a test of your intellectual skill by playing Shogi (I think that's what it was) against Shikamaru. No one gets Chuunin for eight years straight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm honestly surprised there wasn't even one Hyuuga Jonin just, you know, poking around, keeping an eye on things.<br><br>  Ok everything looks good here. Probably should check with the Byakugan just in caaaAAAA JESUS THAT'S OROCHIMARU IT'S A GOOD THING MY BYAKUGAN CAN SEE THROUGH BULLSHIT DISGUISES HEY HOKAGE YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GET THAT GUY! </br></br></br>  <br>Raikage is jobber who got beaten like bitch by that faggot Madara<br>Dai would solo'd him</br></br>  <br> Using fucking DAI to say stronger character=better </br>  <br>3rd, not 4th, nigga. 3rd was a fucking one man army who fought an army for three days before succumbing to exhaustion. 4th is 3rd Lite</br>  <br>speaking of that<br>Rock Lee's VA cant use Macbook<br>https://twitter.com/masukawayouichi<wbr>/status/586915242921164801<br> Masukawa Yōichi (Rock Lee’s VA): “Gai-sensei, I really don’t understand how to use a macbook… what should I do!?” </br></wbr></br></br></br>    <br>Third raikage an heroed by mistake two times. Can't job harder than that</br>  <br>Perhaps, but he also 1v1'd the Eight Tails. Gotta give him that.</br>  <br> dope rider </br>  <br>He jobbed to the MC the second time around, that can hardly be considered jobbing. But I will admit him losing to Naruto's clone because of his own jutsu was sucky.</br>  <br>Is that the name of the comic this is from? I've been posting it hoping someone would mention where its from. Tried image search, came up dry</br>  <br>Sakura only met Orochimaru when he had the grass ninja disguise.<br><br>Why are you blaming her out of all people for not recognizing Orochimaru when his master and his student were both right there?</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura saw Orochimaru in the Forest of Death when he gave Sasuke the Cursed Seal. His Sound Jonin 'disguise' is incredibly similar. Not to mention she's meant to be the most perceptive.</br>  <br>Anko probably recognized him, but she also knew that with Orochimaru the only way to win is not to play</br>  <br>The grass ninja outfit, the sound juunin getup and his real looks are very similar.<br>I made note of how everyone else screwed up too if you bothered to actually read my post but mentioned that she dropped the ball by not mentioning how someone very similar was hanging out right next to everyone else.</br></br>  <br>yeah we got fillers now but this one its Gai's flashbacks and it seems kinda cool one</br>  <br>I did read your post, and I did read that the others should've picked up on something, and you're right (especially Anko, since she also saw Orochimaru AS Orochimaru in the test). The Hokage's shaky reasoning is 'He vaguely threatened the destroy the Village if things don't go his way', like there was ever a chance that he WASN'T going to destroy the Village.</br>  <br>They didn't look that similar.<br><br>Anko and Hiruzen were already both aware that he had just molested a student in the middle of the exams. They are the only ones at fault for being so retarded and not recognizing him.</br></br></br>  <br>His sound Jonin persona is similar, what with the eyeshadow and the fucking snakelike pupils.</br>  Fuck the anime team for delaying the show with fillers. You know why they're doing this? So they can delay the series so that they end it at the exact moment the Boruto movie is released. Fuck them, seriously fuck them when I still haven't yet seen a proper sub for the Naruto: The Last film.  <br>do you think Orochimaru will still remember how he looks like in a hundred years? He might honestly live to see Naruto's great great great great great great grandkids die of old age</br>  <br>I reckon Kishimoto really missed a chance by making young Orochimaru look the same as current Orochimaru, and making current Orochimaru look the same as Gaiden Orochimaru. Like, I get that's his thing, to be immortal, never-aging, never-dying, but I would've liked a hint that his psyche is starting to break down because whenever he looks in a mirror he can't remember what he originally looked like.</br>  <br> Rock Lee <br> son: Metal Lee <br> father: Blues Lee <br> mother: Rhythm Lee </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaguya might actually appear first in video games than in Anime</br>  <br> Fillers <br><br>The Guy flashback also happens in the Manga. I guess we're gonna get to the action next week or so.</br></br></br>  <br>Theres still a chance that could come up in future installments, especially with other writers doing light novels and scripts for specials and arcs in the future. Someones definitely gonna do something with Orochimaru, what with him being the first major antagonist and probably the most iconic villain of the franchise.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the last episode, just the Naruto anime in general. They SHOULD have shown Gai V Madara about 15 episodes ago if they were using proper pacing.</br>  I'm surprised more people - especially the Genin - don't use kunai more often in hand-to-hand combat. Like in the Sakura v Ino fight, the one who whipped out a kunai first would have an advantage.<br><br>It's a bad idea to bring fists to a knife fight.</br></br>  <br> Kaguya might actually appear first in video games than in Anime <br>That's just sad if true.</br></br>  <br>Gai fight isn't coming until near the end of the month, mark my words. They better make it as good as they're gonna make Valley of the End 2</br>  <br><br> Himawari is literally Ninja Hibiki. </br></br>  <br> They better make it as good as they're gonna make Valley of the End 2 <br>You know that is not going to happen.</br></br>  <br> kunais <br> doing anything useful in Naruto </br></br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kI<wbr>URMgxH6do</wbr>  [ ] <br> Not waiting for this </br>  <br>I actually think they'll make both fights good because of one thing; the upcoming Storm game. They're gonna want people to be excited about the stuff thats gonna be in the game, so they're defnitely gonna want to bring their A or at least B game in the animation department. Of course, Valley of the End 2 won't be for another couple of months, but I still think they'll make Gai's fight good to generate some hype for the stage where you use him to beat Madara's ass</br>  <br>I'm kinda bummed about the Last costumes being just a preorder bonus.<br>It all but confirms the story won't get into The Last or have a post-game exploration set in that timeframe when they would be the most free to do interesting stuff.</br></br>  Serious question: Could Kaguya have defeated Madara without Black Zetsu's betrayal?  <br>Not against top-tier Jonin or even Chuunin, no. But against pleb-tier Genin, twelve-years-old, in hand-to-hand? They'd give an advantage.</br>  <br>On the one hand, based on what we know of her and what it took to just seal her away, yes.<br>On the other hand, based on the fact that she has a vagina in Kishi's manga, no.</br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Not really. Even Kishimoto says that the Storm Games do Naruto better than he did.<br>This means whoever's watching the show is doing it wrong and should be playing the storm games</br></br>  <br> Sasuke gets susanoo arm in UNS4 </br>  <br>you don't even have to win, you just have to entertain him for 5 minutes, no one still passes</br>  So if Kaguya used the Infinite Tsukuyomi...<br><br>How does humanity still exist.</br></br>  <br>Hagoromo and Hamura stopped her before everybody was zetsu</br>  <br> implying they won't begin animating the Gaiden in January 2016 <br> implying it won't last another 100 episodes with a metric fuckton of filler despite only spanning 10 measly chapters in the manga </br></br>  <br> implying they won't release The Last Nurudu Gaiden and the Bort movie as DLC expansion </br>  <br>So what was the point of Hamura when the entire story revolved around Hagoromo's descendants and the only things you needed to revive Kaguya were the rinnegan and the tailed beasts' chakra?</br>  <br>MUH PARALELS</br>  <br>Wouldn't that have worked better if it had been Indra and Ashura the ones who sealed their crazy grandma?<br><br>Hamura has nothing to do with either Naruto or Sasuke.</br></br></br>  <br>Tenseigan probably would have worked just as well as Rinnegan since those are the two eyes of origin, which both tie into Kaguya, and Kaguya has higher ties to Byakugan.<br><br>However Hamura and his special eyes were up on the Moon and shit, so people couldn't get to them.<br><br>Hamura after the battle was over with their mother was like Sasuke, stayed away from home to make sure this type of thing could never repeat.<br><br>He stayed up there on the Moon to watch over shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Manly and Naruto just don't go along  <br>After Hagoromo sealed up Kaguya, Hamura created a chakra portal to the moon and built a swinging pad there, to keep an eye on his brother's attempt to create peace on earth. However, I guess even demi-gods aren't truly immortal in this series  that singular honour goes to Orochimaru , so he died, and his order of 'Check on earth in a few hundred years but don't destroy it' got Chinese Whisper'd into 'Check on earth in a few hundred years and destroy it if it looks bad idgaf'. Then, like with Indra and Asura, the descendants of Hamura split apart and had a biff, with one half creating the Tenseigan from their eyes (or that's what it looks like), which it seems is just a gigantic gravity/chakra cannon.<br><br>If you haven't watched The Last, I recommend it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She already is. Gotta find the pic.</br></br>  <br>But Kaguya didn't have the tenseigan. She just had Hagoromo's powers and spammed the shit out of a mangenkyou sharingan technique.</br>  I'm just re-reading the Kiba v Naruto Chuunin Exam fight now. Literally the easiest thing to do.<br><br>  Ha, I have Akumaru <br>  Kiba <br>  Forfeit or I slit his fucking throat <br>  Your call <br><br><br>I believe the Tenseigan was formed by the incredible amount of Byakugan eyes brought together. It's possible Kaguya had the Tenseigan but didn't use it in favour of the Sharingan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But Kaguya didn't have the tenseigan. <br><br>That was literally never said in the post, nothing in the post says she had Tenseigan. It was said she had a higher tie to Byakugan, since she had Byakugan. That doesn't mean she has Tenseigan, but it is true she has more of a connection to that line of eyes.<br><br> She just had Hagoromo's powers and spammed the shit out of a mangenkyou sharingan technique. <br><br>Not true either; she didn't cast black fire and blah blah. She didn't spam Hagumoto's powers either, rather it was Naruto who did that. It was just coincidental that Obito's ability lined up enough to work the same as her ability, despite how that's now how it worked at all and they totally leaped logic there.<br><br>Obito's ability opened a path to another dimension in particular, his dimension, yet they just bullshitted at the end "Well maybe it can open a path to any dimension if I have enough chakra". They sort of wrote things into a corner there with Sasuke teleported away, they had to make up some bullshit to fix it.<br><br>Her typical abilities she showed in the manga were "Turning her hair into giant fists and raining down, reshaping the world, controlling gravity, opening portals, and controlling her bones". Those are the most common ones.<br><br>If it was Hagumoto's abilities she was using there she would be creating chakra yin yang balls or something. She had her own unique techs, but in the end all ninjitsu was hers to command without limit, since she has all the powers.<br><br>There's nothing so much sharingan about her powers though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Best waifu  <br>Roshi could actually teach properly, though. Jiraiya was a shit teacher, it's a miracle Naruto even learned the Rasengan from him in the first place.</br>  <br>H I N A T A B E S T G I R L<br>I<br>N<br>A<br>T<br>A<br><br>B<br>E<br>S<br>T<br><br>G<br>I<br>R<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> junk in the front and the trunk <br>Nurudu's one lucky sunovabitch.</br></br>  <br><br>Literally get chills every time I get to this point. Having an "I. SHALL. NOT. FALL!" moment is always cool as fuck, but when it comes from the person you least expect, it gets better.</br></br>  <br> Jiraya was shit <br> Kakashi was shit <br> Iruka was shit <br> Ebisu was shit <br> Asuma was shit <br> Kurenai did fucking nothing <br> Gai only taught a third of his squad <br> Orochimaru was shit <br> Tsunade was shit training shit <br> what the fuck did Yamato even do  <br> yfw Sauce will end up the the most competent teacher in the series somehow </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuma and Kurenai didn't have to do much other than make sure they their students didn't croak and provide oversight on their training.<br><br>All of their students had hiden jutsu taught to them by their respective clans. So besides keeping note of their development, they had little to actually do. They were more like caretakers than teachers.<br><br>Jiraya taught, or setup naruto to learn, some dank shit. Kakashi was kind of a shit teacher, though. He didn't properly train nardo or sakura at all, and put all of his attention on sasuke. Which is weird, as you would at least expect him to try and teach naruto a few things.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kakashi taught the Chidori and helped improved the Rasengan that Jiraya taught. The Jonin were also less about teaching actual jutsu than teaching them things like perception, stealth, more in-the-field techniques, as well as more subtle skills like Kakashi's tree-walking and Ebisu's water-walking exercises.</br>  <br>Actually, Ebisu was the only good teacher Naruto ever had.</br>  Guys.<br><br>Guys.<br><br>Guys.<br><br>Reminder that Rock Lee is legitimately the most hardcore of the Genin at this time, after after Might Guy is put in a wheelchair, most likely the most hardcore in the Village, and would more likely than not be able to destroy Naruto or Sasuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kakashi taught them how to climb trees that one time.</br>  You know, it's a shame that the ANBU Black Ops seems to have a really bad rap, simply because every time they're seen in the series, they're getting absolutely destroyed by something or other.  <br>They should have known better than to wear masks and be strong while being background characters, recipe for jobbing right there.</br>  <br>The thing is that they're probably hell good at what they do, the problem is they're only shown going up against Kabuto or Orochimaru (I think).</br>  <br> Not to mention she's meant to be the most perceptive. <br>The room contains multiple jonin, a kage, and multiple dojutsu. There is no possible measurement by which you could deem her the most perceptive.</br></br>  <br> By what was said <br>Yes<br> By what was shown <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <br> Playable characters being pre-order locked <br><br>What the fuck? Skins, fine, not a fan but I can live with it, but playable characters?<br><br>I thought Japan was better about keeping this bullshit out of their games?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But against pleb-tier Genin <br>As Temari and Tenten demonstrated, you lose to the first opponent with some ninjutsu.</br></br>  <br>The bonus is probably only a temporary thing. You'll likely be able to get them as DLC in the future. First exclusives as opposed to full exclusives.</br>  <br>  Hand-to-hand <br>I'm not talking about throwing it, I'm talking about walking up to a cunt and knifing them in the throat.</br></br>  <br>Why are you using logical story telling instead of MUH PARALLELS?</br>  <br> Forfeit or I slit his fucking throat <br> Do it and I slit yours <br> Your call <br><br><br> but it is true she has more of a connection to that line of eyes. <br>No it isn't, she had the Rinne Sharingan as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, most perceptive of Team 7, is what I meant. And at the time, neither Byakugan nor Sharigan was active. Although both I and another Anon agreed that both his sensei (Hiruzen) and student (Anko) should've noticed that the Sound Jonin had oddly snakelike pupils.</br>  <br>I have a feeling Kiba wouldn't have risked that. Like, yeah, Naruto is nowhere near dark'n'edgy enough to actually follow through, but considering Kiba has a connection with Akumaru to the level where he can understand his barks, I don't think he'd gamble Akumaru's life.<br><br>Not to mention that he'd probably be a bit stunned after Akumaru dying, before the anger kicked in, to do much.</br></br></br>  <br>Except it says right what it is<br>The Last characters are early access, like you say, but the Kakashi skin, Sarada and Boruto characters are "exclusive content". <br><br>A person who isn't able to preorder is basically jipped of two playable characters completely. That's some shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Orochimaru was shit <br>Woah there.<br><br>Oro turned scattered orphans into a force capable of making a barrier that could hold ANBU. Oro turned Kabuto into a doctor/necromancer hybrid class. Oro turned Sasuke from a genin who knew some fire techniques into a kage level ninja with multiple summons, mastery of his elemental affinity, and a master swordsman in a few years.<br><br>Tsunade taught Sakura and Shizune how to heal, so she can clearly teach as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> put all of his attention on sasuke <br>No, he let him copy shit with his sharingan and then sat around reading while telling him different exercises to use.<br><br>Kakashi is really lazy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She also taught Sakura the Hundred Thing Forehead Tattoo, and how to punch really hard.</br>  <br>So they now get to; burn you, smash you, shock you, drown you from a distance.</br>  <br> snakelike <br>Or foxlike, catlike, geckolike, birdlike, etc.</br></br>  <br> I have a feeling Kiba wouldn't have risked that. <br>Well that's nice but feeling aren't rooted in anything. I can easily reply that he'd be blinded by rage at the thought and go berserk in response to thee action.</br></br>  <br>Well you don't just stand still giving the Tyler Durden 'Hit me!' speech.<br><br><br>And the eyeshadow and similar facial structure?<br><br><br>Yeah, I know it's not based on anything. I have a feeling he'd be smart enough to not sperg out when someone's holding a kunai to his dog's throat, but I guess we'll never really know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Can't job harder than that <br>yamcha in the saiyan saga<br>vegeta in the cell saga</br></br></br>  <br> but the Kakashi skin, Sarada and Boruto characters are "exclusive content" <br>They're pre-order bonuses. It doesn't say anywhere that they're exclusive, just bonuses. You'll probably be able to buy them from the online store.</br></br>  <br> Well you don't just stand still giving the Tyler Durden 'Hit me!' speech. <br>So why do you seem to think they will? You reach for a kunai, they make hand seals, you pull out a kunai, they fire a jutsu.<br><br> And the eyeshadow  <br>It's actually more than he normally uses in a different shape. Also, Gaara confirmed for Orochimaru.<br> and similar facial structure? <br>It's even a little similar. The chin is rounded as opposed to square. The eyes are a different color and more round only imitating sharpness with the eyeliner. The cheekbones aren't defined at all and neither is his nose. Honestly it's Neji with different eyes and tanner skin.<br><br> I have a feeling he'd be smart enough to not sperg out when someone's holding a kunai to his dog's throat <br>That's odd since Kiba's only traits are Cocky and Temperamental.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oro turned Sasuke from a genin who knew some fire techniques into a kage level ninja with multiple summons, mastery of his elemental affinity, and a master swordsman in a few years <br>Most of his progress came from eyehax. After he got MS he didn't even summon another snake until the war.<br><br>Also most of that was just mad science. He's not really a good teacher. He'll just attach a scorpion's tail to your dick and tell you to go nuts.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that "disguise" <br>He didn't even fucking try.</br></br>  <br>Cocky and temperamental doesn't mean he's going to sperg out and risk his best friend in all the worlds life for a chance at a promotion which he can try again for six months later, or get some other way.</br>  Did you guys see that new ED that has Naruto at the ramen shop?<br><br>I thought the part where he's eating with Hinata was adorable.</br></br>  <br>I never said the enemy stands there either. However, in a hand-to-hand fight like with Sakura v Ino (which is what I was originally getting at), the one with the kunai would have an advantage.<br><br>You've gotta be shitting me that you don't think they're similar. Yes, part of it is put down to the fact that they're drawn characters, not real people, but even so, for someone like Hiruzen to not notice the startling similarities - which, despite what you say, there are a few.<br><br>Even someone who's cocky and temperamental would think twice when a loved one is literal centimetres from a messy death.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love that one.<br>  Naruto wolfing it down <br>  Hinata eating politely <br>  Still nearly doubles Naruto's ramen capacity <br><br>Literally a match made in heaven<br><br>  and that split-second where Hinata brushes her hair behind her ear. HHHHNNNNGGGGG </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is officially Konoha's Ramen Eating Champ from some short story awhile back. I forget if it was filler or not, but apparently it was official enough.<br><br>Symbolism with Naruto being the Kushina and Hinata being the Minato.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's cool as shit. Fucking hell I wish there was more anime screentime devoted to the two of them after The Last.<br><br>Also,<br><br>  Hiruzen the strongest <br>  Wood Release ain't shit <br>  Literal instant teleportation ain't shit <br>  Actual holy-Jesus-Christ necromancy ain't shit <br>  Defeating Madara on several occasions ain't shit <br>  Defending the town from the Nine-Tails ain't shit <br>  Being a descendant of an actual demi-god ain't shit <br><br>PressXForDoubt.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shikamaru Gaiden or whatever shows that Naruto and Hinata were spending time together a lot even before the Last movie.<br><br>Seems this relationship has been a long time coming, even if he was dense.</br></br></br>  <br>Retcons are shit.</br>  <br>3rd Hokage managed to hold off both the first and second Hokage when he was his weakest in terms of age. He has a fuckload of chakra, able to use most types of jutsu, and has been shown to have a good selection of techniques.<br><br>Yeah he deserves to be called the strongest Hokage in some rights.<br><br>We never even saw him at half his prime.<br><br>Saying Naruto is the strongest is kind of a cheat</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ooh, I'll need to check that. I know they're underway getting translated, but I'm unsure if Shikamaru Hiden has yet. Either way, reading is well and good, but I want screentime, dammit.<br><br><br>  Better than Hashirama 'fuck you I'm going to turn centuries of tradition and warfare on its head and create a massive conglomeration of shinobi' Senju <br>  Better than Tobirama 'if their eyes turn red they're better off dead' Senju <br>  Better than Minato 'let me just casually fucking teleport a Tailed Beast Ball halfway across the country' Namikaze <br><br>Hmn.<br><br><br>It's been stated that Edo Tensei's shinobi are not at their full strength as they were when they were alive. Hell, Kabuto BUFFS Madara when he revives him and Madara still says that he's not at the same level as when he was alive. And then mauls hundreds of shinobi in about thirty seconds.<br><br>He also didn't notice ROOT happening right under his nose. There's not a chance in hell Tobirama 'best Hokage' Senju would've stood for that, nor would it have gotten past him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nurudu is retcon central. You're just scratching the surface.</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying, Hiruzen was introduced as the ultimate badass but then powerlevels happened and all the previous hokage became OP as fuck.</br>  <br>It's because Kishimoto jumped onto the tried-and-true trope of 'the older something is, the stronger it is'. It's the same in Warhammer 40K, where apparently technology from over ten thousand years before the game is set is way, WAY, WAAAAAAAAAAAY fucking better than anything that was around at the time of gameplay.<br><br>It would've worked if he established that from the start.</br></br></br>  <br> It's the same in Warhammer 40K, where apparently technology from over ten thousand years before the game is set is way, WAY, WAAAAAAAAAAAY fucking better than anything that was around at the time of gameplay <br>To be fair it makes sense because everything's destroyed and all the knowledge of the past has been lost, so the best they can do is scavenge and jury rig shit. They don't even know how their own ships work.</br></br>  <br>Sasuke didn't get the Mangekyou until after Itachi died.<br><br><br> which is what I was originally getting at <br>To which you were quite clearly told kunai suck.<br><br> which, despite what you say, there are a few. <br>Name then then. Put up or shut up cause so far we've got vertical pupilsand eyeshadow which puts Naruto, Kiba, Gaara and Kankuro in the "Secretly Orochimaru" bracket.<br><br> Even someone who's cocky and temperamental would think twice when a loved one is literal centimetres from a messy death. <br>Or just leap into action like the soldier he's trained to be, which is what happened if you recall.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Leap into action <br>It's not a life or death battle, it's just a fight to get a promotion. Kiba just wouldn't risk it, there'd be no point.</br></br>  <br>  You were quite clearly told kunai suck <br>You're a fucking idiot. Go fight a guy with a knife who wants to kill you while you're barehanded. Let me know how it goes.<br><br>  Name them <br>I fucking did you mongoloid. Eyeshadow, facial structure (which despite what you say, is similar enough), pupils (which Naruto wouldn't be mistaken for because in his standard state, his are baby-blue. Kiba's are similarly radically different from Orochimaru's. Gaara doesn't have pupils, and Kankuro's eyes aren't snakelike). You're blind, get your eyes checked.<br><br>  Leap into action like the soldier he's trained to be <br>He's a twelve year old apprentice. You're pulling shit out of your ass to save face and it is drastically falling apart around you. Just stop. There's a reason taking hostages is so effective.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kiba just wouldn't risk it, there'd be no point. <br>The entire point of the exams is to risk your life for a promotion. They literally just escaped a place called the Forest of Death after being made to sign waivers because they might die inside and many did die inside.</br></br>  <br> You're a fucking idiot. <br>I'm not the one asking why no one uses knives in the land of magic fool.<br><br> I fucking did you mongoloid. <br>No you didn't fuckwad you said makeup as if he was the only person in the room wearing it and you keep talking about his facial structure despite a side by side comparison of the two being absolutely different you blind bitch.<br><br> He's a twelve year old apprentice. <br>He's a 12 year old child soldier but keep desperately trying to form an argument champ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but at this point it makes no sense to continue. Continuing means your best friend dies, not continuing means you can just take another shot at promotion in six months. The forest of death was a calculated risk with a certainty less than 100%. Why would you sacrifice your best friends life for a better job, anon?</br>  <br> Continuing means your best friend dies <br>If you suck, if you move you just save him.<br><br>But following that back to<br> Do it and I slit yours <br>Continuing means YOU die. Why would you sacrifice your life for a better job, anon?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Why no one uses knives <br>Hahaha holy fuck please tell me you're trolling. In close combat. When there's no time to form hand seals. Unless you're a Rock Lee/Might Guy/Madara Uchiha taijutsu artist. Someone with a kunai. Will have an advantage. Over someone who doesn't. Look at Asuma's chakra blades.<br><br>  I said makeup <br>Plus the facial structure. Plus the pupils. If you don't think they look similar, I can't help you. You're in the minority.<br><br>  12 year old child soldier <br>He's barely six months out of the academy. His missions have included weeding gardens, babysitting, and running errands.<br><br>  Keep trying to form an argument <br>Pfft, my argument is formed. Step it up, senpai.<br><br><br>  If you move you just save him <br>Man, of course, it's that easy. Why did everyone go through that whole shinobi world war thing against Obito when they could've just beat him? Why did Hashirama have so many ongoing battles with Madara when he could've just won?<br><br>  Continuing means you die <br>  implying Kiba could've stepped to the Nine-Tails chakra that pushes through when Naruto is in life-threatening danger </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're an idiot. Even more of an idiot than Naruto characters and that is a fucking accomplishment.</br>  <br>  Why would you sacrifice your life for a better job, anon? <br><br>You literally JUST said<br><br>  The entire point of the exams is to risk your life for a promotion. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The entire point of the exam is to test your skills to see if you are able to advance. Hell look at Shikamaru, he was the only smart one out of all of them, he knew when he had to give up.</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I understand the point of the exam. Other anon didn't.<br><br>On a completely unrelated topic, there's no real reason to separate Main and Branch Hyuuga families, is there? It's literally just a superiority complex within the clan. Neji never had to be marked, nor did Hizashi. It was just tradition, so they kept it up.</br></br></br>  <br> When there's no time to form hand seals. <br>When has anyone in close combat ever not had time for hand seals? Forming hand seals has literally never been a problem for anyone ever.<br>  Look at Asuma's chakra blades. <br>Your hope is the one sensei who died? And used ninjutsu to make his weapons not shit anyway.<br><br> Plus the facial structure. <br>I posted a picture of how it was different while pointing out the differences, you have yet to make any statement that stand agains that.<br><br> He's barely six months out of the academy. His missions have included weeding gardens, babysitting, and running errands. <br>There's literally no way to know what he did, you don't follow Kiba in the story. If we did and you and made that claim about Naruto, Sasuke, or Sakura it would be unintentionally hilarious.<br><br>  implying Kiba could've stepped to the Nine-Tails chakra that pushes through when Naruto is in life-threatening danger <br>It's not like Naruto has any idea how being a jinchuurriki works at this point.<br><br> Step it up, senpai. <br>Sorry kouhai you're a hundred years to early.<br><br><br> You literally JUST said <br>I'm not the one arguing against that now am I? He asked why you would sacrifice your friend, I ask why you would sacrifice yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More or less from what I understand, The clan is so huge the branch family is used to protect the main one from harm. Hell look at the sages of the six paths, that can be taken the same way. The one that went to the moon's branch family sealed away there byakugan, Imagine if the Hyuuga did that and not just a curse mark on the head.</br>  <br>Because you're not sacrificing yourself you incompetent shitter, you're risking your life but you're not sacrificing it like you would be your friends in a situation when someone has a knife to your dogs throat telling you to give up or they'll kill it. Learn to fucking read so you can coherent arguments for once.</br>  <br>  When has anyone in close combat ever not had time for hand seals <br>Nigga if you're blocking a knife coming to your face - unless you've somehow picked up Haku's one-handed seal technique - you're not going to have time to rattle off the number of seals needed for a high level jutsu. Furthermore, when Madara was wrecking face against the hundreds of Shinobi in the shinobi world war. Not a single one of them performed any sort of Jutsu until Madara used his Fire Release one.<br><br>  Your hope is the one sensei who died? <br>Who was also in the Lord of the Fire Country's elite guard and also stopped a coup from happening. He's a Jonin for a reason. He was going up against two immortals, dude.<br><br>  Pointing out differences <br>The most I'll say is that it's subjective. They're different, but I see the similarities. If you don't, I can't help that.<br><br>  There's no way to know what he did <br>The facts are he's a Genin, which are handed D-Rank. Squad 7 got C (which should have been an A), because Naruto complained and because the team consisted of Naruto the Nine-Tails and Sasuke the golden boy. If Tazuna hadn't jewed the mission down to a C-Rank, the squad would've never taken it.<br><br>  It's not like Naruto has any idea how being a jinchuurriki works at this point. <br>He didn't against Haku or Orochimaru either. He still brought the chakra to the surface without contacting Kurama.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The storm games are a fucking great adaptation of the manga. <br>Like the fight with Jiraiya and Pain. Shit was intense.</br></br>  <br>This kind of shit always gets to me. Nothing manlier than not going down even when you're body is mentally down.</br>  Naruto + Akamaru hostage vs Kiba:<br>It's not only "Give up or the dog dies", but also "You can't kill me" - if the hostage-taker surrenders at any point before he is dead, the proctor and other adults would very likely prevent further injury from occurring, especially if the person being threatened is their village's bijuu container. So, the only way to keep Akamaru alive would be for Kiba to surrender, and even refusing to do so would not give him revenge, only a hollow victory at best, not even guaranteeing a promotion (and losing anyway at worst).<br><br>Naruto doesn't know what to do with bijuu chakra at that time, but if he were in serious danger and also decided not to surrender, I highly doubt someone of crap Genin level (especially someone like Kiba) would have the strength or intelligence to overpower it and kill him.<br><br>Any intelligent hostage-taker with no qualms would win matches against Kiba. Whether making a lifelong enemy in the village in the process is worth it or not is another issue. Of course, Naruto is neither intelligent nor ruthless enough, so the point is moot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if you're blocking a knife coming to your face - unless you've somehow picked up Haku's one-handed seal technique - you're not going to have time to rattle off the number of seals needed for a high level jutsu. <br><br>Unless the medium is live-action, we might as well assume that casting might be a free action that takes 0 seconds of real-time (as is attack-calling, taunting, monologues, and multiple-episode filler flashbacks). Assuming that the character has enough plot armor or plot interest.</br></br></br>  <br>Well they are useful im UNS games</br>  <br>Naruto's Kyubi form was shown in Storm 3 before the anime.</br>  <br>What about the pain arc?</br>  <br> Sakura-chan is so moe~! I need to unlock her before anyone else! </br>  <br>Sakura shills are embarrassing.</br>  <br>Is there an anime character stronger than Madara Uchiha?<br>And I'm referring to Rinne Tensei Madara Uchiha with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikidou paths ability) equipped with his Gunbai and control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, a complete Susano'o, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in his chest so he can perform Mokuton kekkei genkai and yin-yang release ninjutsu as well as being extremely skilled in taijutsu and bukijutsu.</br></br>  <br><br><br> she eats him under the table <br> some years later he eats her under the table </br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it was shown in the anime before but I can't recall correctly.</br>  I kinda wish they'd continue the story fouced primairly on the kids learning from their parents. Chapter 700 kinda hinted at this and then 700+10 at the very end.<br><br>Would love to see the InoShikaCho 3.0 learn from their parents and it seems they possess skills from each parents.<br><br>Be interesting to see Inojin combine the Ink/Art Jutsu from Sai with Ino's Mind Jutsu...Shikadai combine Shadow Manipulation with possibly a smaller version of Temari's fan...then you have Chouchou who could perfect the Akimichi Pills further than Chouji and could have Lightning affinity from Karui.<br><br>Then you have Lee training the new Lee. Hijinks of Konohamaru training Bolt/Salad/Mitsuki. Maybe we learn a little more about the characters who didn't have kids (Kiba, Shino, Tenten), and then from the new movie...we could learn more about Gaara, Kankuro, Bee, and Darui.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Did we ever get confirmation that Lee/1010 got together?  <br>No. We may in the film or if there's a Nardo GT.</br>  <br>adorable</br>  <br>At least we know Hinata probably swallows.</br>  <br>They should really just get the main series over with and do some adorable post-Last era stories. Is that really so much to ask?</br>    Naruto could actually be enjoyable if they turned it into a SoL instead of a battle shounen.  <br>I think it's a certainty.</br>  <br>Hell, the purpose of Akatsuki is retconned, like, twice!</br>  <br>Just like DragonBall Super?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, after he realized how much of a massive fuckup he was and how badly he let shit get, that needed nardo to fix shit for him.</br></br>  is /a/ really arguing about how a character is supposed to realize the semblance of two characters in an anime? if we start doing that i don't think i'll be able to watch Saekano anymore  <br>Sure, why not?<br><br>Watch everyone run around the village just doing goofy shit. It would be fun to watch.</br></br></br>   yfw Gai was a Guy   <br>Tobirama and his ripoff's kunai are actually dangerous though.</br>  <br>Depends on the Jutsu in question. To show off the Sharingan's ability, Kakashi copied Zabuza's Water Release: Water Dragon Jutsu, which is comprised of over thirty seals. That would not be considered a Free Action.</br>  <br>I say this every single time there's a Naruto thread. The only hope of this happening is if someone else gets the OK to work on the series without Kishimoto having the final yes/no say, and then deciding to play towards a slightly older audience, rather than the usual 12-15 year old crowd.</br>  <br> the third was said to be the strongest of all </br>  <br> he forgot minato </br>  <br> 3rd and 4th are fucking jobbers <br> the idea of each generation being stronger is retconned <br> konoha was established to keep kids out of war even though that makes no sense </br></br></br>  <br> literally Tobirama ripoff </br>  <br>The real question is whether Kishi's big announcement is something to do with Nardo or him moving on to something else.<br>There's plenty of potentially interesting stories to tell in that era (ninja UN, world building, more low-key hunt for rouge badguys) and if Pierot don't have to stick everything to the plot of the manga (see all the Coolest Guy wanking to make Naruto forgiving him less of a stupid moment) they might even be able to create something watchable.</br></br>  <br>I've been reading the old series, and one of the 'extras' page has a drawing of a mafia-type manga and Kishimoto saying it was the best manga he'd ever done and was around 160 pages at the point, but he never got around to officially publishing it or anything, but it's always something he's REALLY wanted to go back to.<br><br>Kishimoto has said he's pretty much done with Naruto for now. He might come back and do small one-shots here and there like Gaiden, but there'll be no more massive overarcing storylines.</br></br></br>  <br> there'll be no more massive overarcing storylines <br>Good, he fucking sucked at those. <br>Did anyone actually like the whole Uchiha magic eyes and DARKNESS bullshit? Smaller arcs like Pein's attack were far, far more interesting than slogging through what, four years of boring 'war'.</br></br></br>  I can't believe I'm watching Naruto. I always hated it.<br>The characters are cliched to hell, and everything is mediocre, though somehow its fun and entertaining.<br>Show me the way back to the light /a/</br></br>  <br>I enjoyed the Land of Waves arc, Chuunin Exam arc and Sasuke Retrieval arc.<br><br> What a surprise, they're all the ones before Sasuke went all Spiderman 3 <br><br>Literally all I want is several small arcs devoted to each relationship. Obviously SasuSaku, NaruHina, and ShikaTema would be the main ones, since they are pretty much the main characters/favourites, but there'd also be InoSai and Chouji...Cloud Kunoichi. I want some Home and Away bullshit going on.  That, and Naruto and Hinata's cute as all fuck dating period. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SasuSaku <br>There really isn't much of a relationship there, just Sakura raising their daughter alone after he goes full black dad on them.<br>In the Last era we could see her be, well, lonely as fuck and entertaining the idea of going after Sauce.<br> NaruHina <br>The best route would be others remarking on how disgustingly sweet they are, with a little bit of actually showing them. Other stuff like the family training or taking a vacation in that magical frog land could be interesting. As for dating, much as I'd like seeing it in a SoL fashion, I don't see anyone daring to actually make that.<br> ShikaTema <br>One of the better angles of their thing is how low key it is. It just happened, to no one's surprise. If you show too much of it might just spoil that magic.<br><br>I'd actually like a small story about the Ino-Shika-Cho going to the Cloud for some political stuff and Chouji meeting Karui (?). Maybe have Naruto and Hinata along too for shenanigans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pic related is the GOAT ninja in Naruto. Feel free to realise all your opinions are wrong now.  <br>He died to 20 fodder lightning niggers</br>  <br>But my opinion is right</br>  <br> He was summoned twice by the same person using his jutsu. <br><br> He doesn't escape said jutsu like Madara. <br><br> He doesn't push the edge off a ledge <br><br>I still like him though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Your garbage manga ended kindly fuck off until you inevitably sperg out when the movie is released. <br><br>saged</br></br>  <br> Gaiden is just ended <br> movie info leaking everyday <br> anime is still fucking airing <br> B-but im a 4channer so i have to hate Narudo </br></br></br></br>  <br>Go back to reddit, Narutard.</br>  <br>What's SoL?<br><br>There would've had to be some point where Sasuke actually settled down, if only for a short while. I'd like to see a point where he was just chilling in Konoha, relaxed and at peace with himself.<br><br><br>  Fodder <br>  Kinkaku Force <br>Yeah no<br><br><br>Didn't really have a choice with the summoning. It just sort of happened. I do wonder why he didn't just revitalise like Madara does, considering he invented the Jutsu. I assume it's because Kabuto gave Madara free will with the resurrection, and Madara somehow figured out more about it than the inventor did.<br><br><br>  I don't like this series so no one else is allowed to <br>Don't ever change, /a/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SoL means Slice of Life</br>  <br><br> What's SoL? <br><br>Narutards really are cancerous newfags.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least they're not cunts who like to derail threads though!</br>  Konoha Arcades when?  <br>soon</br>  Does Killer Bee count?   implying Chouji didn't become a manly viking   <br> saged <br>these are the people who shitpost in these threads</br></br>  <br>Chouji is almost certainly whipped by Karui. I see that lasting only as long as Chouji can't be bothered getting divorce papers.</br>  <br>They sure would have an interesting dynamic. On the one hand EXPAND DONG can make a girl very happy, leave her wanting more and thus be quite reasonable, but on the other Karui does have an attitude.<br>I would use 'henpecked', not outright whipped, though.</br></br>  <br>I think it's just lucky that Chouji's such an easygoing, happy-go-lucky guy</br>  <br>Shame he was never given some interaction with Naruto in the academy, he could have had a real friend that way and we would not have to deal with him obsessing about Sasuke as his first "friend".</br>  <br>Kakashi, shikamaru, konoha, and garra are translated, and sakura is partially done</br>  <br>I thought they had some.<br><br>I recall seeing somethings where Naruto was cutting class with Chouji, Shikamaru &amp; Kiba and that when they were smaller he would play with Chouji &amp; Shikamaru before their parents came and picked them up.<br><br>I really hope that isn't some headcanon I think is real.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there was some filler with that during the filler hell, from what I recall.</br>  <br>That was when they did that leaf-on-forehead concentration thingy.</br>  <br>Just finished rereading part 1 and man the third hokage is a fucking tardo about the whole thing. Every couple chapters in the exam arc someone says "hey we should do something about orochimaru!" And then sandaime says "no, we have strong ninjas, we will wait and see what happens".</br>  <br>Best ninja won best girl</br>  <br>Crap. <br><br>Well at least it exists and it's not my headcanon taking over.</br></br></br>  <br>Cutting class part was in the manga, it's during his elemental training he's remembering how useless he was at academy, Kishy first retconned him being completely ostracisez and then retconned his retcon.</br>  <br>Yep.<br>It's beyond bizarre.</br></br>  <br>This is the sort of shit that should have made his advisers suggest he train someone else to be Hokage, so his senility doesn't keep causing shit like that or letting people socially isolate the human weapon who becomes more stable if he's loved.</br>  <br> yfw Sauce will end up the the most competent teacher in the series somehow <br>If he teaches like he fathers</br></br>  <br>Can't be worse than shoving a kid off a cliff and hoping he doesn't die.</br>  <br>Isn't that how you teach swimming?

It is such a demanding technique that it takes up all the ninja magic potential of a person, sort of like how that one spell took up and burned out Rincewind's magical ability.</br></br>  <br>I want to sniff Hinata's nice pale interbreed tooshie.</br>  <br> six hundred billion <br>Those were some fun threads that retarded line launched.</br></br>  Sakura and Hinata are cute.  <br>Root wouldn't get by Tobirama because he'd probably be running the organization himself.</br>  <br> but there was no real confirmation, was there? <br>I dunno.

I mean don't get me wrong, from what we've seen of her in the vast majority of the manga she's a despicable cunt and everything bad that happens to her is her own making, but fuck's sake Kishi goes out of his way to make her suffer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He actually likes Sakura a lot and is confused about why she isn't more popular.</br>  <br>Kishi should stop liking characters. Nothing good ever comes of it.</br>  <br>i could understand that shipping because ya know<br>both got neglected by Hiashi<br>and Hinata went full "Muh father doesn't consider me as heir please train me Neji nee-san"<br>also incest isn't big no-no in nipland, its more like opposite<br>also theres a doujin of it<br>http://nhentai.net/g/34188/</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Whose this semen demon</br></br></br>  <br>yep<br>remember one time she faved the anko?<br>guess how it turned out now...</br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't know <br>She's a literal semon demon.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he just wanted to make sure there was enough of her to go around after hearing all those complaints about how she's never in the series.</br>  <br>i know people usually say that timeskip was when everything got awful, but for me the turning point was when curse seals became The Thing.<br><br>  so edgy even Kishi had to phase them out </br></br></br>  <br> tfw no Sitcom-styled spinoff with Coolest Guy, Itachi and Madara raising Salad. </br>    <br>Curse seals were fine. They were actually pretty cool.</br>  <br>kishi is closet faggot that designs good female characters but either he completely forgets them or turns them a complete bitch</br>  <br>Rock Lee should have been the one to go eight gates, what happen to the new generation surpass the old?</br>  <br>That only applies if you're a genetic super being, not some handicapped pleb who can't even use ninja magic.</br>  <br> Go 8 gates <br> Naruto can't infuse life force anymore <br> Die </br></br></br>  <br>Can't one of you niggas just share the Viz scans? Lately I'm seeing a lot of those in these threads</br>  <br>Search Naruto (Digital) (AnHeroGold-Empire) in the /co/ archives.</br>  <br>Normally I would tell you to fuck off back to /co/, but this was really helpful. Thank you very much.</br>  <br>what should have happen is 8 Gates Guy defeating the Madara in exchange for his life.<br>Then Zetsu's Plan B should have been commenced aka bringing back Kaguya</br></br>  <br> could be confused with an Itachi cosplayer <br>So he made her look like his number 1 perfect husbando? That's an argument for him liking her<br><br> does a retarded charge-in <br>Didn't that end up saving Sasuke and Sarada's lives?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>daily reminder she would win shikamarubowl if she didn't got killed</br>  <br>Temari's pretty good, managing to spot and take out her main rival with a perfect excuse within a few panels.<br>Does that make her better than Tayuya?</br></br>  <br> Didn't that end up saving Sasuke and Sarada's lives? <br> implying they weren't toying with Baldy so they could figure out exactly what he was up to <br> implying Pink Shit didn't run in like a retard punch their only lead and then fall into a dimensional tunnel <br> implying Orochimaru wouldn't have been right if they got there a few seconds later </br></br></br></br>  <br> she caused Sasuke to lose the only 'lead' he had in 12 years <br> this enabled him to leave once more while looking legit <br> the only time he willingly comes back is to train Bolt </br></br></br>  <br> what should have happen is 8 Gates Guy defeating the Madara in exchange for his life. <br>That would have elevated that Guy jobber beyond the roof.</br></br>  <br><br>But kabuto won the tayuya bowl</br></br>   nurutu <br>Fuck off, tumblrtards. Nobody wants your kind around here.</br>  <br>This has me wondering, given how incredibly broken crazy science went into him, could Kabuto have taken Kaguya?<br>Even the Eyehax Brothers were only able to mindrape him into being a good guy.</br></br>  <br> the only time he willingly comes back is to train Bolt <br>Actually Bort has to go find him if I remember correctly. Which is funny because it shows that he won't come back to see his own daughter, but rather to train the local edgelord whose daddy is his buttbuddy.</br></br>  <br> you will absorb a qt girl and make her into your penis </br>  <br>It would be enjoyable to the end if it didn't become Dragon Ball battle shounen, but remained early Naruto battle shounen</br>  <br>Dude, i would beat the shit out of you.</br>  <br> No statue <br>dropped</br></br>  <br>Shin had nothing to do with the Kaguya threat. Sasuke just didn't like the idea of some random kids having the sharingan.</br>  <br><br>The old sasuke would have massacred the kids though for shitting on the uchiha legacy. I guess he really has changed</br></br>  <br>How was Sasuke supposed to save Sarada with no Susanoo, being unable to move and with Naruto still being too stabbed to do anything?</br>  <br> what is Izanagi </br>  Catching up but did any of you guys see this coming?  <br>The only legacy he left is an adorable little girl.<br><br>He should be welcoming the 50 new expendable Uchihafag kids with MS with a welcome arm.</br></br></br>  <br>Kek! I like Sarada and all but she ain't worth one of his eyes, especially his left one.<br><br> Yes, I'm an awful person </br></br></br>  <br><br>Also if the faggot sage expected this, why the fuck give half his power to sasuke?</br></br>  <br>That was a fun week.</br>  <br> The only legacy he left is an adorable little girl <br> implying he isn't just fattening her up so he can eventually transplant her eyes into Bort <br> implying that isn't why he was pursuing Shin to begin with </br></br></br>  <br>This fucking macro she had on Obito all this time. Golden years.</br>  <br> Hagoromo sees this <br> doesn't immediately take away that edgelord's Indra powers  <br>Fucking old people.</br></br></br>  <br>  Better than Tobirama 'if their eyes turn red they're better off dead' Senju </br>  <br><br>Maybe he enjoys watching deathmatches between his sons<br><br>He knew it would come to that before fucking off in his chilled out dimension</br></br></br></br>  <br>I knew Kishi was too much of a hack to make Sasuke turn good again through reason and not through homolust and TNJ.</br>    <br>You need hand seals to activate that.</br>  <br>That is rather poorly drawn.</br>  <br><br>It wasn't fun when we didn't know who won the narutobowl and that fucking week in between having it confirmed</br></br>  <br>I am talking about editing that panel</br>    <br>remember the bomb?<br>remember the mole who screencapped all those NS tears?<br>good times indeed...</br></br></br>  <br><br>All that smack talk and then Kakashi lays down the law and talks down to sasuke like a little bitch and there's nothing he can do about it<br><br>felt god</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hinata winning was all but confirmed with the Last album cover reveal and it got more and more confirmed for a good few weeks, with Pinkshit fans growing more and more hilariously delusional.</br>  <br>i prefer akatsuki version instead<br>but that one is nice too</br></br>  <br><br> Hinata better be dreaming this crap <br> Toneri cuckposts <br> I just threw up <br><br>holy shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still does the little pushing of fingers together <br>Nigga, that is adorable.</br></br>  <br>You mean when he officially pardoned him?</br>  <br>It was the event of the decade.<br>Only OP ending will top this</br></br>  <br><br>You mean when luffy gets paired with some random bimbo?</br></br>  <br>I never got into it.

Her father loved the cloth that she wove and so she worked very hard every day to weave it. However, Orihime was sad that because of her hard work she could never meet and fall in love with anyone. Concerned about his daughter, Tentei arranged for her to meet Hikoboshi who lived and worked on the other side of the Amanogawa. When the two met, they fell instantly in love with each other and married shortly thereafter. However, once married, Orihime no longer would weave cloth for Tentei and Hikoboshi allowed his cows to stray all over Heaven. In anger, Tentei separated the two lovers across the Amanogawa and forbade them to meet. Orihime became despondent at the loss of her husband and asked her father to let them meet again. Tentei was moved by his daughter’s tears and allowed the two to meet on the 7th day of the 7th month if she worked hard and finished her weaving. <br><br>Requesting Tanabata art of the Weaving Princess.</br></br>    The hell that isn't a new drawing, why did you pick that.<br>Requesting lewds of these two please</br>  I would appreciate anything of Kurumi.

Rough lewds<br>Anything lewd and being done roughly</br>  <br>Wait did someone draw this for me like they did ? I honestly wasn't expecting that after I found out about the Megumi one and that I'd skipped over it. Thanks, drawfriend.</br>  requesting tamamo lying in bed pov similar to this<br>Maybe with a fang showing</br>  Requesting Megumi masturbating and curling her toes.  Requesting the fagotts in tuxedos.  <br>I seem to have forgotten the image.</br>  REQUESTING:<br>Battle of the Bands with BECK Mongolian Chop Squad against Ho-kago Tea Time</br>  Requesting shark themed dunktank for these loli to be dunked please.  I would love a mecha-girl dog-girl of a BuCue from Gundam please  Requesting Sawyer sitting on a chair, shoes off, in a pose a lot like this one: <br><br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2756923<br><br>Perhaps holding her UltraVoice to her neck/throat.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Jesus, watching that gave me a hardon.<br>That said, I don't know why anyone would want to draw what you're requesting.</br></br>  <br><br>ycake is that you? Because it certainly isn't me.  I like it </br></br>  <br> That's your weekend delivery <br><br> He better not request this weekend <br><br>not him but is there a general rule against requesting on the weekend if youve been delivered to during the week? because its tuesday.<br>i suppose its just another "fuck (insertcharacter)fag" but even then why wouldnt he be able to request on the weekend?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just Lolyfag spilling his autism, ignore it and I hope the OR does too.</br>  <br> got two deliveries in the weekend <br> requested again like a greedy fuck <br> requesting right when the weekend just finished <br> got another delivery <br> will try and request again this weekend <br>Sounds like a case of being a greedy asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>while there's no actual rules regarding this, the WWDs exist as a sort of containment thread to keep the waifu requests out of the general drawthreads, which is why normally you wouldn't request your waifu in the regular drawthread during the week.</br>  Just by the name, I assume the waifu drawthread happens on weekends, but does it start on Friday or Saturday?  <br>At the moment it starts on friday, early in the morning american time, but it seems to be getting earlier every week.<br>It lasts until the sunday is over, again, american time, but as long as the final thread is alive, it'll last into monday as well.</br></br>  <br>Exactly. Spamming your waifu getting drawn in both the weekend and weekday is selfish as fuck. Not that it can't be done, but seriously don't expect shit the rest of the week<br>He doesn't even draw. Just vultures in streams</br></br>  Requesting Junko Enoshima and Ikusaba Mukuro in this exact position except instead of Junko Holding up fried chicken she's holding up the earth.  <br>And is the biggest crybaby this side of faggot town.</br>  <br>Never saw any rules about it.</br>  Requesting Mato Kuroi and Black Rock Shooter from the BRS series in the kitchen trying to cook something but ultimately failing or having a hard time at it, please!<br><br>Thanks if you pick this up!</br></br>  <br>shit if its true i dont know how i didnt notice this since i was there<br><br><br>like i said then<br><br><br>i suppose so<br>but because its an overflow of waifu i suppose  husbandos are ok to request during the week <br>since theyre far and few in between<br><br><br>12:00am 4chan time (EST) and ends sunday night when the last thread dies<br>although it seems that anons are ignoring the start and just making it hours earlier like this last one<br>4 hours early i think<br><br><br>i tend to treat the WWD and the general as two separate beasts<br>as in if i get a delivery in WWD i can request an entirely separate pic when monday comes around and vise versa with the general,<br>but if thats not advised, whats the general rule on wait times until you can request again?<br>i always though around a week would be good<br>again, NOT for re-requesting, for an entirely different request</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Maki from love live starting at a clock with a worried expression almost on the verge of tears because husbando-kun hasn't been home in days, please.  ;_;   <br>pls</br>  <br>You can have a million requests in the general and no one would know, unless you stick to the same characters or your waifu, making it obvious. If you want something similar, just wait few days, maybe 2-3 threads, should be fine.<br><br>Waifu requests in the general should be only something that wouldn't get drawn in WWD (interaction with other characters, overly complicated scenarios), but the more you request, the more you risk someone complaining about it.</br></br></br>  <br>I see, so that makes it pretty early in the "weekend"<br><br><br>I'm new to the waifu drawthreads but I feel like I shouldn't involve her until the weekend comes.<br><br>Thanks for the info</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no rule. Just intuition that you're milking drawings for you for free.<br>Tone it down, or request something that isn't so "draw my waifu"y</br></br>  Requesting this drawing of Birdy with colors please. <br>She is wearing jean shorts not too sure on the top colors, so I'll leave that to colorfag. <br>http://imgur.com/a/cmY90#0<br>Thank you~</br></br></br>  <br>i usually only request my husbando in both the general and the WWD but i keep it the requests really simple so i guess i should be fine by that logic<br><br><br> all of my requests are draw X(pic) but with Y(husbando) <br>fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Diegofag please.</br>  <br> spoiler <br>Then how come I still hardly ever see husbandos in here?<br>I get tired of drawing waifus sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>Requesting Maki from love live starting at a cock with a worried expression almost on the verge of tears because its so much bigger than her husbando-kuns, and shes trying so hard to resist.</br>  [Sniff lolibutt]<br><br>Requesting her on all four please.</br></br>  Lolyfag please fucking stop.  <br> kitty.jpg <br>you had one job anon</br></br>  <br> Kitty <br>That's a dog, you scum.</br></br>  Reposting my request from a few threads back, lost track of the threads for a bit.<br><br>Requesting Rias Gremory in a dunk tank please.

AV will never draw your request <br> even when he's done similar stuff as commissions </br>  Requesting Kohaku, from Tsukihime, unleashing Ea. Thank you.  Is it okay to request something for someone just once because they no longer can and it's something they really wanted? Or is that also looked down upon/interpreted as an excuse for harem posting?  <br>I see no problem with it. Especially if it's in the general.</br>  <br>Literally nothing here is okay. There will always be a contingent of autists waiting to shitpost you for doing anything, including drawing, commenting, and having fun.<br>But if it's not against the board rules, you can do it, and requesting is not against the rules. You might be well advised to keep the monkeys from finding out about it, however.</br></br>  <br>I would pay good money for his drawings</br>  <br>Just request for him but don't say anything about it.</br>  <br>So long as he could draw who I want and not make them look exactly the same as every other girl he draws even I'd commission him.</br>  <br>Don't know what you're talking about. He can draw different faces just fine.</br>  <br>I hope you aren't being serious.</br>  Requesting Risty presenting a cake to the viewer or just something birthday related.  <br> There will always be a contingent of autists waiting to shitpost you for doing anything, including drawing <br>Never been proven right so quickly<br><br>Sasuga drawthreads</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then can you draw better than him?</br>  <br> you cant draw better than them, so you're critique's invalid </br>  Two characters.

Any ideas?</br>  <br> There will always be a contingent of autists waiting to shitpost you for doing anything, including drawing, commenting, and having fun. <br><br>It makes me laugh at the thought that a bunch of 20-25 year olds getting agitated over the chance of receiving some crudely done drawings.</br></br></br>  Requesting Sandalphon (left) playing with plushies of the Gunbuster bugs (right), please  <br>Come back when you've experienced AV for years.</br>  kirino  <br>Nice try.</br>  <br>adult video?</br>  <br>audio visual?</br>    <br>Awesome work!</br>  <br>Nice job, anon</br>  Requesting cute loli waifus with cute tiny dicks  http://pastebin.com/nNqLb83U   2 days   <br>Hey, Arch, if you read this, is there any chance you could draw the girl on the far right  (which is supposed to be Reika from Smile Precure as a sexy school teacher, btw) bending over to pick a piece of chalk and unknowingly showing her delicious ass to her students? Just an idea I just got...</br>  <br>Everything about this drawing is simply wonderful, thank you so very much. Her dress design, taking off her shoe, her glove, all very suited for her.</br>  It confuses the shit out of me that there are actually people here who just want free drawings, not human interaction, and if there was a drawfag delivery dispenser you could press a button on once a day and sometimes get a drawing, they'd never come back to these threads.<br><br>They're always like "WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUST REQUEST AND FUCK OFF OR DRAW AND FUCK OFF."<br><br>And I'm like... well, because I want to talk to other people who share my interests in anime art and illustration, whether or not they're drawfags? Is that confusing? I don't want to shitpost anyone, I just wanna hang out and take it easy.<br><br><br> ASOC direct requesting <br>Arch too stronk</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That Reika pic is actually an old request of mine, btw.<br>It doesn't have to be Arch, anyone here can try and do any of the requests, I just thought of asking Arch 1st, that's all. <br>Now back to work before the boss asks where I am...</br></br></br>  <br> not on the list <br>Thank goodness.</br></br>  <br>That list really sucks.</br>  <br>Sorry, I didn't mean to bully you. Arch is my favorite active drawfag.</br>  <br>The problem is the threads and streams have become less and less about anime and anime art and cute art of anime characters and have just become a pissing contest between drawfags and requesters constantly pissing and moaning on both ends. Obviously there are still good requesters that dont do that, and good drawfags that dont go out of their way to do that either, but lately it feels like the minorities are far too vocal, maybe they might be majorities we dont know. It is seriously a waifu pissing contest between requesters that like the thematic and might take it a little too seriously and drawfags who dont respect it at all and just want to draw shit. Of course they are both right in wrong in their own ways.<br><br>Weekend waifu threads are where most the activity is, yet unlike before people arent drawing in those threads for the thematic, but rather the volume of people. Same with the people requesting, they are simply requesting there just because the general is absolutely dead in the water during the weekends, it is lucky to get 50-100 posts in the three day period. I feel more of the problems in terms of what "should be ok" and what isnt would be much easier to iron out if weekend threads were either removed or used for its intended purpose</br></br></br>  <br> Tamamo cheerleader <br>Yes please</br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br> On the list <br>better hope that list just goes by extremely slow.</br></br>  <br>add ro-500</br>  <br>We have an IRC for that though. For the 50th time, this isn't a chatroom</br>  <br>All the girls on that list suck.</br>    <br> not on the list <br>Damn.</br></br>  <br>who is she</br>  <br> Be drawfag that likes the waifu thematic <br> Everyone on both sides distrusts you <br><br>Life is awesome!<br><br><br> implying the IRC has been about the drawthreads any time recently </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would love to tell you, but I'm a pussy and don't want that kind of public attention drawn to my waifu.</br>  <br>I wanted to add more waifus but I don't want to overwork ycakechan</br>  <br>Misha</br>  <br>Why those waifus though? There are a lot more viable candidates.</br>  <br> Sorry, I didn't mean to bully you.  <br>Don't worry about it, but I can't help but chuckle at what kids call "bullying" these days.<br>Idk, maybe I'm ouch of touch... Laters!</br></br></br>  <br>i picked characters i like, or who are a good fit for dunk. You can suggest more or add to it, I don't care.</br>  <br>*out of touch <br>Damn these touch screen keyboards... Now I really feel old!</br></br>  <br>What makes them good for dunking?</br>  I thought the point of drawthreads was for drawfags to hang out and talk about drawing stuff and any request fulfilling is incidental.<br><br>But you treat this shit like it's an obligation. Drawfags are here because they want to be but if you treat them them like some sort of waifu pinatas they will just leave.</br></br>  <br>Oh, was Ycake going to draw the dunk collage?<br>I wish he hadn't dropped the disgaea collage...</br></br>  <br> waifu pinatas <br>I would like this of my waifu. Sounds cute.</br></br>  <br>any smug snarky type is good. Or someone who would be a good heckler like ryuko.</br>  <br> caring about a shitposter's wellbeing </br>  <br>Your waifu being a pinata or falling out of a pinata?</br>  <br> &gt;implying the IRC has been about the drawthreads any time recently <br>Well complain to the IRC then, not us.</br></br>    <br>Then why is Kobori on there? She has none of those qualities.</br>  <br>I'd say that about most of the waifus he picked. Seems like he's just going for the popular ones to stir shit.</br>  <br>I just picked the cutest waifus mostly. Actual dunk tank personality characters like sachiko aren't posted in the weekend threads.</br>  <br>Whoa now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with just coming to these threads to ask for free drawings without any further interaction. I fall very heavily on the "human interaction" side, but I also know not everyone has the same interests.<br><br><br>If the discussion is drawing-related, there's nothing wrong with doing it here. Of course, some conversations are easier to have in a chat room, and obviously the idle unrelated chitchat doesn't belong here. What's funny is that a lot of that has been offloaded to actual chat rooms which should be a good thing, but now anons bitch as if people being friendly and interacting outside of the threads is the end of the world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Ycake actually doing this or is this just a pipe dream and we know Ycake is a lazy fuck who won't follow through with it?</br>  <br>asoc   how many times have you worked on Tamamo, and yet you still miss the white on her tail </br>  Can you make only one image of demon fox (all nine-tails) sage mode naruto (while he's still human form) and while using body flicker technique with eternal mangekyou sharingan Sasuke while he's using Raikage's Ultimate level of Lightning Aura (naruto chapter 463 page 08) and while using body flicker technique while both of them team up while naruto makes a rasenshuriken while it's expanded like the one shown in naruto manga chapter 432 with sasuke combining naruto's rasenshuriken with amaterasu's black flames and alot of electricty from kirin around the black flames raseshuriken while sasuke uses susanoo and sets it's bones on fire with amaterasu (naruto 463 page 15) and tsukuyomi. Can you do that please? Thnx  <br>well i wasn't the one who reposted the pastebin with the dunk tank image up there, I don't know if it was ycake or if it was chihayafag, but it most certainly was not me. I do hope he's legit, but ycake is ycake so I probably won't be able to get a straight response half the time.</br>  <br>Takane Shijou</br>      <br>So who is it?</br>  <br>Oora!</br>    <br>Kanako?</br>  <br> Whoa now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with just coming to these threads to ask for free drawings without any further interaction <br><br>Well, of course not. There is something wrong with deciding to interact only to complain about interaction, which is what a lot of these guys do.<br><br>"This isn't your chat room!

She doesn't have a single otakubait visual feature or anything in that direction.  <br>ZR?</br>  <br>You're attracted to memes</br>  <br>Side tail maybe.</br>  kongou de-su  <br>Barely visible on official CG.</br>  <br>Because historically she literally was.</br>  <br>I wish i can baked or cook.</br>  <br><br>Archer kaga</br></br>  <br>You mean in a naval fight in pitch black, and the Washington shooting her from behind which the rest of the fleet lost track of her while the Kirishima was engaging her target?<br><br>Maybe if you want to shitpost you shouldn't bring up such a well known example of context being important.</br></br></br>  I guess the reason why Kaga is so popular and is leading the doujinshi ranking is that she doesn't have any super obvious visual, verbal or whatever ticks so people don't get bored of her so easily.  Duki.  <br>Who's second on that ranking? Isn't it a Kongou?</br>  <br>Who is she showing her butt off to?</br>  <br/>  <br><br>-translated<br>Shimakaze Showing 1-50 of 219<br>Kaga Showing 1-50 of 176<br>Kongou Showing 1-50 of 166</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How many doujins did Kaga and Kongou get at the latest Comiket? Top 4 last I checked was 271 (Kaga), 270 (Kongou), Shimakaze, and Haruna as of C77.</br>  <br> Scanned </br>  <br>If no one bothers to scan them then they are shit. Also good luck trying to count unscanned ones.</br>  <br>They might be scanned  in chinese. </br>  <br>People scanning doujin have their own taste (whether it's shit or not is another debate), but it kind of alters the ranking.</br>  <br>Rekt</br>  <br>Based on the announcements Kaga gets the most doujinshi next Comiket, so there is quite a big lead now. <br><br>On Pixiv she overtook Kongou some months ago and is only behind Shimakaze.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I wish it were me. I want a girl to show off her butt to me at least once in my life.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>What you never had a pantyshot in your life ?</br>  <br> On Pixiv she overtook some months ago <br>Proof?</br></br>  RJ!  <br>Can you let this go, now that you finally got to OP?</br>  <br>Now read this in Karen's voice <br><br><br>Now say this in Kirisaki Chitoge's voice</br></br></br></br>  <br> Now read this in Karen's voice <br>So, same voice?</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sq4<wbr>24K_-skI</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Well, literally.</br>  <br>Her VA is quite the slaveboo</br>  <br>stats</br>  <br>Stats and common drop, if Bucky had Poi like stats she would be easily behind faga.</br>  <br>She is perfect.</br>  <br><br>Remember when Taihou arrived and you people were saying she would absolutely dethrone Kaga because her stats were better? And how do you even explain all the secondaries being attracted to her?</br></br>  <br><br>Is Uesaka Sumire Fubuki we deserved?</br></br>  <br>Secondaries only care about fan shit, most of the fan shit is dominated by characters like Kaga, thus Kaga is super popular with secondaries.</br>  <br>She should have but<br> Tanaka <br>Also do you live in a world where kaga is the finest taste in earth and only the most elite and selected TTK are able to marry her? How is less of a secondary bait than the rest? Some people here literally joined the game for her.</br></br></br>    <br>Shouldn't you mean Akagi, if we're going that route?</br>  <br>Sure, Akagi is also really popular with secondaries. Her bloated glutton meme is proof of that.</br>  <br>Kirishima is a slut who got doubled teamed during the war.</br>   secondary just became even more meaningless   <br>You make it sound like Gook joined here just for the Bucky.</br>  <br> superior BB </br>  <br>So, we bully Akagi. Cool.</br>  Kaga a popular.  <br>Actually playing an even shitter RNG game than KanColle. Actually playing a shitty game made by a bunch of incompetent Slavs.</br>  <br>At least those slavs try to look like they are balancing the game, unlike kadokawa.</br>  Who fucking cares if a character is popular?<br>Just play the damn game and discover your own favorites.</br>  <br><br>Even though there's historical inaccuries and some errors in ship designs, Battlestations Pacific and Midway are superior to World of Warships garbage.</br></br>  <br>Try Cinderella Girls first, then try again</br>  <br> wasting time on idol shit </br>  <br>I don't see how bullying is going to matter, the most popular characters in KanColle have been in the top ten since day one. Kaga, Akagi, Kongou, ect are going to remain dominate until the game is a corpse, and no new character or stat re-balance is going to change that.</br>  <br> Battlestations Pacific and Midway are superior to World of Warships garbage. <br><br>So fucking true.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank god for Senix and Gamespy for the continued support, oh wait.</br>  <br> mfw servers went down so no multiplayer ever again </br>  <br>Well, it's not like new characters can't make a big splash now and again. Yu's transformation into a Brazilian seemed to have got her some brownie points with the fans. Though she seems to be the one rare case of this to happen these days.</br>  <br>They're right in that the characters are popular with secondaries, but they're wrong in implying that this somehow makes the characters worse or that people that play the game can't also like them<br>Though I'm fairly sure that the guy with kaga in all his filenames doesn't even play the game</br></br>  <br>Those are the same people that call other secondary bait like Kongou, TenTatsu and Shimakaze shit taste, fuck off, etc, but kaga gets a free pass, hmmm I wonder what it means?</br>  <br>Are you the guy who was autist enough to be able to identify people with just their writing and file naming styles, and time of connection?</br>  <br>Anon, being able to read filenames is not autism.<br>It's blatantly obvious it's the same guy.</br></br>  <br>No, I just have the ability to read</br>    <br>Being popular in KanColle doesn't mean the girl in question is a super broken special snowflake. It does mean however, that doujins, models, and fan art is going to be dominated by them, since these artists are really banking on these character's bigger fame to get them hits or make them money.</br>  <br>Not true, more than one time someone tried to call me out of samefagging and it wasnt even close, some people cant deal with others not having the common opinion I guess.</br>  <br> Needing 3DPG. </br>  <br>That doesn't mean anything, there will always be characters that are more popular than others in every franchise</br>  <br> hmmm I wonder what it means? <br>It means you're a paranoid faggot grasping at straws. If you can prove they're the same people then go for it, otherwise just drop this silly argument and accept other people can like things you don't.</br></br>  <br>I'm actually kind of surprised that some <br>new characters never made it that popular. <br>I really thought Seaport Water Oni was <br>going to join the massive Hoppou <br>and Wanko craze.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/filena<wbr>me/kaga/<br>If you can't find a pattern here, you're blind.<br>Not saying every single post is the same person, though.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>There's 2 of them though. Kaga- and Kaga numbers.</br>  <br>Can I watch the game if I never touched the game and I just care about cute girls?</br>  <br>There's a third one that uses booru samples only.</br>  <br> watch the game <br>It's not very exiting.</br></br>  <br>Sure, just find a livestream during an event. <br><br> For the question you meant to ask, don't watch the anime. </br></br></br>  <br>You can watch the anime without playing the game but the anime is kinda shitty.<br>Playing the game is really easy nowadays, you should give it a try.</br></br>  <br> Sure, just find a livestream during an event. <br>Yeah, this. It's really fun [spoiler[together with /jp/[/spoiler].</br></br>  Daijoubu  <br>I'm aware. You can still tell what I mean, though.</br>  <br> [spoiler[ </br>  <br>Pretty sure that debate was because she got a really high fanart rate at the start before it died down. The prediction was that she would have the most fanart out of all CVs within a year.</br>  <br>It's not just really easy, it's now impossible to not be able to enter now that a lottery-less server exists.</br>  <br>Taihou still a cute anyway.<br>I hope fumikane designs more girls.<br><br>Yeah, that's what I meant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah she's cute, I just wish she wasn't a bigger taiha magnet than Akagi. I don't want to have to bench her like I did Akagi once I got Hiryuu to kai 2.</br>  <br>So how did that turn out anyways?<br> Any server crashes, super long queues, <br>or a bunch of gaijin go home internet <br>protests? I would think dropping the lottery would of made a bigger buzz.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What a cute loli kongou</br>  <br>Just because they dropped the lottery for one server doesn't mean DMM stopped their foreign IP block. You still have to use a VPN to register and play, though you can use API, flash, or cookie method to play once you're in the server.</br>  Thank you, Kiyo.  <br>It's really just luck, man. Only thing that could reduce it is setting her as flagship.<br><br>Nothing really happened, kadokawa just got a server that was powerful enough to sustain its users without a lottery filtering things out.<br>You still need to use a method to get around their IP block, but the cookie method is super easy anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know, but flag position is reserved for my shipfu, Myoukou, or a CVL during surface fleet.</br>  <br>But without the lottery it's easier for foreigner to access the game. I know that i had to stay awake during 3 night so that i can compete for a slot.</br>  <br>Kadokawa already said they don't care about foreigners playing the game.</br>  <br>I guess they probably hit their popularity peak when it came to interest in Japan. That or the server held up pretty well, since none of those things seemed to have been a issue.</br>  <br>Aoba is olev and doesnt get nearly enough attention</br>  <br>Kadokawa doesn't care about gaijins playing, it's DMM. The servers are owned by Kadokawa.</br>  <br>This server is much more powerful than the other ones. It likely can just handle the load.</br>  <br>She is for tenderly spoiling</br>  <br><br>Yeah i know once we are in the game there is no such things as nip or gaijin but only TTK. What i mean is that now it's easier for foreigner to have access to the game, which is very nice (even thought the lottery was fun in a masochist way).</br></br>  <br> (even thought the lottery was fun in a masochist way). <br>There's something very wrong with you.</br></br>  <br>There's something very slutty about Suzuya.</br>  <br>Well i enjoy KancColle with it's RNG so you might be right.</br>  <br>What meme is this?</br>  <br> KancColle <br>You don't have to try so hard to add the C.</br></br>  Sendai wants to learn about adult night battles. Will you help her?  <br>I just don't want to attract the usual shitposter.</br>  <br>The only slutty thing about her is her body.</br>  <br>Only is we can invite Naka too.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>He's autistic but harmless.</br>  <br><br><br>Kongou Bongou is bretty gud, but Fusou isn't bad at all after the stock hull grind. She's just... boring. Her only interesting trait is that she's got six turrets and can shoot really far. That's it. <br><br> But she's worth it for Nagato.  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont know why the lottery is such a big deal. I saw the time they had more spots.Was up two hours into that time and got in just fine on my first lottery attempt.</br>  <br>Why'd they have to add the ugly paper ship for tier 9 though.</br>  <br>You were lucky then, i had to do it 3 time before getting in and having 8h of difference from japan didn't help.</br>  <br>8 hour difference isn't that bad, try 15/16 where it'd be in the middle of the night on a weekday.</br>    <br>It's just you. I also have 8h of difference and got in with the first try.</br>  <br> Muh ghetto Nelson Class <br>WG had already posted a screenshot of the Nelson modeled, it may have just been less work to move its rear turret and superstructure and then reskin it instead of adding a whole new ship.</br></br>  <br>I guess i just really have bad luck then.</br>  <br>Is Kongou fun to play ? Because i struggle a bit with Miyogi i just unlocked the last hull which make it easier to grind but i find my DD and CL more rewarding to play.</br>  <br>Cruisers are the best for fast arcade action anyway.</br>  <br>Kuma~</br>  <br>Do her shorts turn anyone else the fuck on or is it just me?</br>  <br>Sendai knows full well what Adult Night Battles are.</br>  <br>What age would you place Sendai at? I honestly cant really say. She appears adult and childish all at once.</br>  <br>Jintsuu is cute</br>  <br>high school</br>  <br>I can't sexualize the Kuma.</br>  Kuma has a hairy pussy.  <br>Sendai's asymetrical stockings are a miracle of the Naval District.</br>  <br>16-17 year old.</br>  <br>16 - 17. Some might say the perfect age.</br>  <br>You talking about her sister?</br>  <br>You're just not trying hard enough</br>  <br>27</br>  <br>91</br>  <br>The 3D models look pretty decent. I wish I could try out the game.</br>  <br/>  <br>Shhhhhhhhhhh! Pocket-senkan is sleeping.</br>    <br>But Tama is not a cat.</br>    <br>Damn the 3D model look really good. Why didn't they do the same for the PSVita ?</br>  <br>Wo a shit.</br>  <br>Because the VITA game isn't done by Sega.</br>  <br>Because you need an actual platform to make a port.</br>  <br>I'm really really curious now about how the Fusou-class rigging looks in the 3D models, the in-game sprites don't really help that munch on how their layout is.</br>  <br>Because that would make it worth buying. I even have a vita, but it seems better to stick with the browser game. Especially because I doubt the vita game will get updates.</br>  Before playing Kancolle with small c I liked Kongou the most because engrish.<br>But my first BB was Kirishima and her tone is delicious, reminds me of the tone she uses for KWSM.</br>  <br>You haven't been paying attention to Kancolle Kai knews, have you?</br>  <br>news*</br>  <br>I have, the turn based system is neat and all but it's still not really enough to convince me to buy it.</br>  <br>Something like that?</br>  <br>That's fanmade.</br>  http://images.wikia.com/kancolle/im<wbr>ages/c/ca/Kuma-Equipment_3.ogg<br><br>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></br></wbr>  <br>Why is she so perfect?</br>  <br>[Citation needed]</br>  <br>球磨型軽巡洋艦の2番艦、多摩だにゃ。水雷戦隊の旗艦として、ご奉公するに<wbr>ゃ！にゃ？多摩って名前だけど、猫じゃないもん！</wbr></br>    <br>Kongou is very fun to play, once you get her engine and upgraded hull. She's basically a rape engine that runs at 30 knots, slaughters everything at her tier or below, and can hold her own against poorer tier 6 players.

It should be World at War, which at least features the Pacific theatre.</br>  <br>Im sure that even in futaba guides, the first thing they mention about carriers is kaga.

Please give me a cookie! <br><br>Here, have atleast a reply.</br></br></br>  <br>Her tits are huge and her voice is cute and soothing. That sidetail is also pretty great. Also stats.</br>  <br>Yeah whatever</br>  <br>Best CV in the game, being one of the original girls since the game's release, a warm personality that is hidden by an aloof facade.</br>  <br>Where do you see her waifustat? I almost could understand loyality, but what about the other one?<br><br>Or is the fact that she looks "normal" and doesnt yell or anything?</br></br></br>  Kuudere<br>Waifu<br><br>I love me some Kaga. Also a fan of Shiranui, so there is a general love for kuudere moe.</br></br></br>  <br> a warm personality that is hidden by an aloof facade. <br><br>Some people see what they want to see, I guess,</br></br></br>  <br>Kaga is an endless source of vanilla doujinshi</br>  Kaga this Kaga that, just ignore our retarded post, please   this one samefaggot sperging about Kaga <br><br>Thread ruined.</br></br>  <br> Waifu <br>Where?</br></br>  <br>Also a good comedy vehicle</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I don't see any hint of warmness in her. She just seems... Well, she reminds me of the servitor unit from the original Dawn of War. An emotionless automaton that just recites responses to commands.  I WILL DO AS YOU ASK. </br></br>  <br>So much good stuff still not translated or even scanned.</br>  <br>Well, thats how shes presented.<br><br>Fanfiction and headcanon can do crazy things.</br></br></br>  <br> ... </br>  <br>Doesn't that sound like the perfect Japanese house wife?</br>  <br>That's certainly true. Well, as far as waifus are concerned, Kagafags could do a lot worse. <br><br><br>Shid :DDDD</br></br></br></br>  Repu   people post about the girls they like <br> other people complain about it <br><br>Sure, which side is the redarted one?</br></br></br>  <br> Kagafags could do a lot worse <br>I don't understand</br></br>  <br>So the people who like one of the most popular characters are secretly shitposting samefags? That's some military grade delusion.<br><br><br>Listen to her voice, it's nowhere near as cold as you're making it out to be. She might be bad at expressing emotions but that doesn't make her a robot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wouldnt that be Yamato, maybe Houshou?</br>  <br>Well, that might be the case when it comes to her pairing with the self insert TTK. Her being the center of the two most popular yuri pairing also helps in the fan art department.</br>  <br>Nah, its pretty monotonus.</br>    <br><br>That's some lowtier shitposting</br></br>     Meanwhile new evil arise     <br>Just look at her wedding line honestly</br>  <br><br>Good stuff. Can't wait for more. I wish Wo-chan would appear again though.</br></br>  <br>WHO</br>  <br>They are too easy, it's not rewarding like melting the frozen heart of a robot.</br>  Which shipgirl would be best suited for femdom?  <br>So one line dictates her whole personality? Ok.</br>  <br>You are trying a little too hard.</br>  <br>No, but it contributes</br>  <br>So you're saying all her lines are lovey dovey, she just doesn't know how to express herself?</br>  <br>Delicious assfangs. I want to violate her purity.</br>  <br>Where did this "all lines" stuff come from<br>I'm saying that she's not the robot you're making her out to be and she's clearly capable of emotion</br></br>  needs more Ushio.  <br>Katori</br>  <br>Of course it does, her one line about the 5th carrier division led to the biggest yuri paring of the franchise.</br>  <br><br>Well, I suppose it's better than the scrapping or target practice for ships that don't manage to become museums.<br><br>Still, the Yamato is actually closer to the surface than Musashi. But if you want to actually dive on a ship that isn't really a mass grave. Then it would be the Nagato.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, it's time to change filename again, I wish I had a faster PC</br>  <br>How so?<br><br>Say for example X player gets kaga as a drop, he will start playing with her, obviously he's not gonna hear her wedding line at lvl 1, what can he interpret from the rest of the other lines?</br></br></br>  <br><br> used goods </br></br>  <br>To this day I still don't understand what's supposed to be between buki's legs and skirt.<br>Is it a peek of her buttcheekies, some sort of underskirt, big pantsu?</br></br>  I wish they would add Akagi's hourly line. <br>It's quite obvious that the lines are telling a story. Really loved the Myouko-class ones.</br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br> what can he interpret from the rest of the other lines <br>That she is a fucking quiet girl. She herself says that she doesn't show emotions easily, so don't expect her to be dere at lvl.1.</br></br>  <br> what can he interpret from the rest of the other lines? <br>That she's a kuudere.</br></br>  <br>It's like you never touched an original Japanese sailor fuku skirt.</br>  <br>Sadly I haven't.</br>  <br><br> Kongou is a slut </br></br>  ta best and cutest BB Re can go home.  <br>Though I love how Kaga's 22:00 line got interpreted in so many ways until the devs confirmed that the line refered to Sendai.</br>  How would Evangelion be different if Asuka had been the MC instead of Shinji?  The point of the entire show would be moot.  Third Impact happen on episode 5  <br>It'd still be shit. Fuck off waifufag.</br>  Masturbation, menstruations and insanity  That masturbation scene on the beginning of EoE would be super interesting.  Kaworu would have fixed her.<br><br>Asuka's problem is that she desperately wants to feel loved and has a massive inferiority complex. Kaworu is a being that loves unconditionally, selflessly and completely, and so he would've had a positive influence on her.</br></br>  <br>No it wouldn't.<br>Asuka still has problems making interpersonal relationships without Shinji.</br></br>  <br>Although Asuka has a man's jaw, I don't think that would be enough for Kaworu.</br>  <br> No it wouldn't. <br> Asuka still has problems making interpersonal relationships without Shinji. <br>You missed the joke, I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu was attracted to the flaws and fragility in people, things like gender are irrelevant to him. Had Asuka been in Shinji's place Kaworu would have probably fallen in love with her all the same.</br>  <br>I thought about it, but I don't think a joke of this magnitude is in order.</br>      <br>they are love rival</br>  <br>More like lovers.</br>  <br>they can love rival eachother while they fuck in the bedroom</br>  <br><br>Dont forget their interactions wouldve been hilarious.</br></br>    <br><br><br>Thanks /a/, now i want this to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>kek, those kids sure are wacky</br>  <br> Not this </br>  <br>who's moot</br>  <br>That's incest, you faggot.</br>   Kaworufags ruin an eva thread before it can even begin <br><br>At least it was a shit premise to begin with.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>The thread was started by a Kaworufag, you retard.</br>  <br>why she is in the plugsuit?</br>  it would be the same steaming pile of shit  <br>all the children are flawed and have weaknesses. the series wouldn't have been any different, other than rei being a boy instead</br>  <br>Any paring involving Rei is incest since she's the mother of all life</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  I wouldn't give a fuck because Eva would still be the pretentious piece of shit that fanboys eat out of Anno's ass.  <br> Be me <br> Go in thread <br> 'Maybe this will be less cancerous than the last eva thread <br> horriblemistake.jpeg <br><br>Anyway, It would have been more obvious from the beginning that Asuka wasn't really an asshole she was just so fucked up that she had to put up a front and be overly agressive with everyone she met. She probably would have an more obvious arc towards resolving this and Shinji and Rei's passivity would have looked 10x's worse through her lens. <br><br>In a way Shinji is a nice balance between Rei 'no fucks given' Ayanami and Asuka 'SIMPLY THE BEST' Soryu<br><br> Pray that storyboard-chan does not ruin this thread </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She would be a dyke to keep some of the same thematic focus involving sexuality as she lusts after Misato, Rei, and Hikari.</br></br>  <br>How's that butt burn from the last thread treating you?</br>  <br> Hikari <br> flawed <br><br><br>Is it your first day here? Eva threads are usually this cancerous</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode 24 would have been praised as the greatest love story ever told  <br>The Only thing burning my butt would be the liquid shit I took after consuming so many of his tears last night.<br><br>I'm naive and overly hopeful. I do this too myself all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>I recall you leaving the thread with your tail between your legs after you got BTFO consistently. It was pretty funny, but of course no one expects you to admit it.</br>  <br> Not episode 18 </br>  <br>The entire basis for every anime ever would be different.<br><br>Instead of a beta male becoming the main charicture in every anime ever it would be an alpha female.</br></br></br>  <br>It's called sleeping on an Eastern US time schedule. <br><br>Maybe you'll find an interview where Anno calls me lazy or something, butt hurt storyboard-chan.<br><br>Anyway here's your last reply until you actually talk about the topic of the thread because I'm only slightly cancerous unlike your full-fledged, terminal, tumors the size of Giant Rei, pure, unrepentant fucking cancer that you are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Touji a Reifag?<br><br><br> implying I'm even the guy from last night <br>Everyone fucking saw it, man. You can't hide it.<br>You're doing exactly what I called you out on, running away and trying to bullshit your way out of the conversation. Again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but hatesex with Asuka would be better.</br>  <br>Didn't he fuck her in some EoE deleted scene?</br>  <br>It was like shinji thought up a world where he wasn't alive and Touji and Asuka were together.</br>  <br>Yeah. Rei will get dick from no one but Gendo and other ugly old men.</br>  <br>Shinji and Asuka aren't that different, are they? He even acts a little like her the moment he gets a bit of self esteem and a backbone, though that only lasts half an episode before Leliel eats him.</br>  <br>They're two sides of the same coin, suffering with the same problem but choosing to deal with it in two different ways.</br>  <br>Touji is a hikarifag. He's egging Shinji on in this scene.</br>  <br> The point of the entire show would be moot. </br>  <br> Touji is a hikarifag <br>He's literally indifferent to Hikari the entire series. She's such a beta cuck even Fuyutsuki is in awe.</br></br>  <br> Toji <br> Hikarifag <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  what if the rebuilds were done by someone other then Anno?  <br>why is the first reply always the best</br>  <br><br>Hikari is awkward as fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Well aside from Hikari, which is implied as like an actual possible pairing. He's an obvious misatofag.</br></br>  <br>Nice hatred towards Rei there Asukafag. <br><br>Jesus, Asuka is the one into old man dick, not Rei.</br></br></br>  <br>This is technically true, the best kind of true.</br>  <br> Asuka is the one into old man dick, not Rei. <br>?</br></br>  <br>She wins the Shinji in some shit video game<br><br><br>She is cute as fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're into something else now</br>  <br> She wins the Shinji in some shit video game <br>No she doesn't. The game ends with Shinji regaining his memories and apologizing to Hikari for kissing her, and the world goes back to normal.</br></br>  <br>Rei is the only heterosexual in the entire franchise.</br>  <br>Well, he got farther with her than Toji ever did.<br><br>Still, holy shit that sounds terrible, why the fuck did an amnesiac Shinji sudden get the hots for the blandest female in the franchise</br></br></br>  <br>Funny joke</br>  <br>Not Rei.</br>  <br>Well no shit, since Touji couldn't give less than two shits about her. He was all about Rei and Misato, but since Anno hates him he forced him with Asuka in the EoE dream world.<br> Shinji sudden get the hots for the blandest female in the franchise <br>The game came out around when episode 13 aired to be fair. A lot of shit about it is inconsistent with the show.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be a shitty shoujo</br>  Why does Misato get so little love?  <br>In the series, Asuka begs Kaji to fuck her, even starts undressing.</br>  <br>Don't worry, Toji gets  a loli  Rei in  Anima <br><br>The game sounds fucking weird. It's first impression, right? The only Eva games I've played have been those GoS VN and I'm trying to emulate NGE2 but it emulates like ass and it's all in moonrunes so I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. All I know is that I made best girl Maya blush</br></br></br>  <br> mfw no doujins where Asuka and Mari teach Rei about degeneracy </br>  <br>Because people like to be cucked by a cunt or autistic dolls</br>  <br>Where?</br>  <br>Kaji isn't an old man though.</br>  <br>Gunbuster wasn't a shoujo</br>  <br>In Anima the loli Rei loves Kaworu like she does in Puchi Eva. For some reason this is a thing because of that one scene in Death and Rebuild.</br>  <br> The purest form of love <br> degeneracy <br><br>But yes, I'd pay good money to see that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it's Kaworu, of course his cock is getting sucked by everyone.</br>  <br>Yes, degeneracy</br>  <br>Why are they perfect for each other?</br>  <br><br> degeneracy </br></br>  <br>is that candy corn?</br>    <br>wut<br>no it isn't retard</br></br>  <br>Yes it is you pleb. Rei and Kaworu are technically siblings, they even have the same parents: the FAR.</br>  <br>No, it's rat poop</br>  <br> implying Asuka is alpha </br>  <br>In ep 22 on the aicraft carrier.</br>  <br>You're a moron. By your logic all Lilith-based life is incest anyway.</br>  <br> You're a moron <br>Nigga, it's fact. Why else do you think Rei and Kaworu look so fucking similar?<br> all Lilith-based life is incest anyway <br>It is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei's body is mostly based on Yui's.</br>  why did they use children to pilot the eva's again?  <br>it's supposed to be because children wouldn't have had enough horrible experiences that they'd have trouble syncing with the Evas. but obviously that doesn't end up being true.</br>  <br>Because the Evangelions have a human soul inside them, and typically the only compatible pilots are the child of that soul.<br><br>Rei and Unit-00 are a special case.</br></br></br>  <br>She was created by the same thing(s) Kaworu was, that makes them brother and sister.</br>  <br>That goes for all of the others as well, since the souls are from them to begin with.<br><br>Fuck off with your retardation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>thank you anons</br></br>  <br> making up shit </br>  <br> Nigga, it's fact. Why else do you think Rei and Kaworu look so fucking similar? <br>They don't look similar besides red eyes.</br></br>  How to fix Evangelion:<br><br>Remove Mari.<br>Remove Kaworu.<br>Remove Rei Q and any other clone.<br><br>Cut out the retarded pandering shit for Asuka.<br>Stop shitting on characters like Rei just because the writers doesn't like it getting popular.<br><br>Write the rest of the characters seriously, with the intent to make each and one of them good on an individual level.<br><br>Cut out the looping crap. No piggybacking on previous successes or shitty attempts to change it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You what? Lilin and Angels are their children respectively, sure it'd be varying degrees of incest as well; but how the fuck does that invalidate the fact that Kaworu and Rei are siblings?</br>  <br><br> How to fix the Rebuilds <br><br>Eva itself is nearly perfect, don't lump it in with those abominations.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're the only ones with red eyes and the albino-ish white skin for a reason. No other character in the series has such unnatural hair colors and eyes.</br>  <br> hurr de durr <br>Rebuild is Evangelion, as much as you or I might hate it. <br><br>But yeah I'm not referring to the original when I wrote that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The idea that they are siblings is 100% fanwank.<br><br>Nowhere ever is it stated they are siblings, or even implied.</br></br></br>  <br>Rebuild was always intended to be a sequel, they need the looping to explain how that's possible.</br>  <br>rebuild isnt canon</br>  <br><br> Michael Bay's shitshow is Transformers, as much as you or I might hate it. <br><br>Taking something and completely warping it into something new and terrible while still slapping the original name on it doesn't mean it has to be considered to be the same entity as the original.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The idea that they are siblings is 100% fanwank. <br>You're fucking retarded. Adam and Lilith are both made by the FAR, they're the same type of existence; they're siblings. Get the fuck over it. Rei even says he's the same as her twice in the show.</br></br>  <br>It isn't, you're just the type of faggot who laughs at le epigg caps and lots of replies.</br>  <br>They don't need looping, and Rebuild shouldn't be a sequel.<br><br><br>Now you're being autistic, I don't even disagree. Not going to bother replying any more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They fit easier, and the main reason is the souls bonded to the Eva. Shinji got Eva 1 because his mom was the soul of it, for example.</br>  <br> Rebuild shouldn't be a sequel. <br>But it is. Therefore looping is needed and wanted.</br></br>  <br> waah wahh fanwank <br><br>Kill yourself. I wish I could meet you in real life so I could punch the shit out of your face.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm delusional and choose to ignore things I don't like! <br>Thanks for confirming. <br> I wish I could meet you in real life so I could punch the shit out of your face. <br>You can't even get your fatass off your couch, nigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Barking up the wrong tree, I get out, go to work, normie as fuck, and it's no coincidence the ONLY place I meet dipshits like you are here.<br><br>Fucking nobody, and I'm telling you NOBODY spreads shit like you in real life because they know they'll get it, and in real life they don't have an anonymous entity to protect them either.<br><br>Take your fawank, shove it up your ass, and get the fuck out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>except adam and lilith are based on different "seeds" you faggot. it's like having different DNA therefore not blood related.<br><br>take your incestfag shit elsewhere and get lost.</br></br></br>  <br>You are a fucking retarded piece of shit who barely even deserves to live. You are so obviously, clearly wrong in this instance and you still have the nerve to actually pretend you aren't full of shit.<br><br>Let me explain: there is nothing in the series whatsoever that validates your claim what-so-fucking-ever.<br><br>If Kaworu says "you're the same as me", it does not mean they are fucking siblings. Do you even know what a sibling is?<br><br>Have you ever seen some part about them being born of the same parent, growing up or whatever at all in the series or EoE? Anything?<br><br>When Shinji tells Asuka "you're the same as me", does that mean Shinji is Asuka's long lost brother?<br><br>I want you to take at least five minutes to reflect on how fucking retarded you are, and how much better the world would be without you living it. <br><br><br><br>Rebuild is a broken turd. That post explains how to fix it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lying on the internet <br>How more pathetic can you get?<br><br><br>No shit, both seeds being created by the FAR; which were originally beings who possessed both seeds. <br> it's like having different DNA therefore not blood related <br>They're fucking aliens, you can't use that argument here.<br>Kaworu says they're the same in episode 24, Shinji says they're the same in episode 24, Rei says they're the same in episode 25. Classified information confirms they are akin to siblings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br> all this fanwank <br>top kek</br></br>  <br> samefagging <br>Wow.<br> Have you ever seen some part about them being born of the same parent <br>Classified Information confirms it.<br> If Kaworu says "you're the same as me", it does not mean they are fucking siblings <br>He's literally referring to them being the same type of existence, unlike <br> Shinji tells Asuka "you're the same as me" <br>Where he's talking about their personalities and insecurities.<br>I think you may be autistic. Just because you don't like it doesn't suddenly make it invalid. It's the truth and the fanbase has collectively agreed on it. You're just a delusional, irrelevant minority that absolutely no one gives a shit about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   thread already long since devolved into lame puns, shippershit and internet tough guying <br>Same as it ever was.</br>  <br>Classified information says no such thing. The rest you said was retarded dumb fanwank that even contradicts the show.</br>  <br>You shouldn't call my ebin sci-fi incest plot fanwank, anon-kun. That's not very nice.</br>    <br>That's not five minutes, you can't even get that right.<br><br>Again, no part of the series confirms or evidences any of the bullshit you just said.<br><br>Noone except you thinks this shit, the fandom collectively agreed you're a huge faggot that these eva threads would be better without. It's absolutely true.<br><br>The only one with autism here is you, since you can't separate a pet theory (one that's debunked) from actual facts and reality. You think that because you like it, it's invalid.<br><br>It's invalid because the series doesn't support it. There is no mention of either being the other's sibling, or anything that would otherwise imply it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Classified information says no such thing. <br>Yes it does. The FAR created Adam and Lilith. This makes them siblings. <br> that even contradicts the show <br>No nigger, it actually supports the events from the show and Rei's own words. Provides a lot more context to Rei and Kaworu's forbidden union in EoE.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes it does. The FAR created Adam and Lilith. This makes them siblings.  <br><br>The FAR is a race. They are not one entity. Moreover, it doesn't make them siblings just because one entity (which they aren't) created them.<br><br>Nice try though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They would have fucked </br>  <br> filename <br>Fanfiction writer please leave.</br></br>  <br> Noone except you thinks this shit <br>Actually the Japanese and Western fanbases majorly regard Rei and Kaworu as being akin to siblings. Just check Evageeks, they take it as common knowledge.<br> It's invalid because the series doesn't support it.  <br>The series confirms it, and it's directly implied based on their conversation and union in EoE.<br><br><br>If they come from the same entity, they're as much as siblings as an alien race is gonna get. Explains why they look so similar.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The FAR is a whole collective of beings, they are also used in plural, the "First Ancestral Race".<br><br>Now if we, the humans created two new beings, which we do every fucking day, they're not siblings. I'm not your sibling. Any other anon here isn't your sibling.<br><br>You need a common parent and you need to be raised together. <br><br>In NGE, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br>In EoE, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br>In NGE2, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br><br>The classified information you refer to is not supporting you in any way either.<br><br>Take your fanwank somewhere else please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I look forward to the next movie.  <br> If they come from the same entity, they're as much as siblings as an alien race is gonna get. Explains why they look so similar. <br><br>Yeah, I like how they have the same hair color or facial features. Woops.<br><br>They don't come from the same enity because the FAR is not an entity. It's a whole fucking race. <br><br>They are a humanoid species that live as a race:<br> The humanoid species, referred to as the First Ancestral Race, <br>as explained by the shit you think backs you up.<br><br>There is nothing here that would make them siblings. Since the FAR also created the souls each "seed" carries, that would make everyone siblings forever.<br><br>Your logic is retarded, your idea is retarded, and you're pathetic for thinking anyone except your own little deluded mind buys it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh oh. Don't mention Evageeks when storyboard-chan is around. He'll use copypasta from their website to tell you why you're a faggot for using them.</br></br>  <br>Actually the Japanese and Western fanbases don't regard Rei and Kaworu as being akin to siblings. Just check Evageeks, they take it as common knowledge.<br><br> The series confirms it, and it's directly implied based on their conversation and union in EoE. <br>The series doesn't confirm it because there doesn't exist a single reference tot hem as siblings, and their conversation in EoE does not touch the subject whatsoever.<br><br>Seriously, you've shown no proof.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thread is a what if scenario <br> Fanfiction </br></br>  <br> using the opinions of Evageeks as proof <br><br>You know, are you trolling us right now? How fucked up do you need to be to sink as low as you have?<br><br>Face it, your theory is unsupported, it's shit, doesn't make sense, doesn't add anything to the series, and would even make it a lot worse since it'd make everything even more contrived.<br><br>Do you have some sort of fetish for siblings or something? Why can't you just accept the fact that you're wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the same retarded idiot that ruined the evangelion thread yesterday once he got obsessed to prove that Shinji hates Rei or something?  <br> Any other anon here isn't your sibling. <br>Actually that's wrong. We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors.<br> You need a common parent and you need to be raised together.  <br>That's a pretty retarded definition of sibling you have there, the way they are raised has nothing to do with it. It's about genetics solely. Furthermore, to alien beings who don't have shit like genetics and blood-relation, this is the closet we are gonna get: akin to siblings.<br> The classified information you refer to is not supporting you in any way either. <br>Yes, it does. EoE refers them joining as a forbidden union, they are similar in appearance, and regard each other as the same type of lifeform.<br><br><br> It's a whole fucking race.  <br>And yet they're only capable of making two different types of seeds that all act in the same manner since the Dead Sea Scrolls are so reliable. <br> that would make everyone siblings forever. <br>And?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what if scenario <br> not fanfiction </br></br>   This thread   <br>Why's that? Would Asuka be more forward about her feelings if she was the MC?</br>  <br> Seriously, you've shown no proof. <br>Yes I have, you just keep ignoring it. Why would the union between Adam and Lilith be considered 'forbidden'? Why did Sadamoto bother to make them look so similar?<br><br><br> I don't like it, so it must be wrong! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors. <br>Might as well bust out some Determinism.</br></br>  <br>what is he doing with his left hand?</br>  <br>No because it worked out in his fanfiction.</br>  <br> And yet they're only capable of making two different types of seeds that all act in the same manner since the Dead Sea Scrolls are so reliable.  <br><br>It says there's multiple seeds out there, and even if it didn't, you would be fucking retarded to assume they're the only ones given the scenario.<br><br> And? <br>Because we obviously aren't, neither are they.<br><br>real talk: are you diagnosed with some sort of autism, aspergers or any sort of disorder?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know exactly what he's doing</br>  <br> Actually that's wrong. We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors. <br>That settles it. You don't even know what a sibling is.<br><br>We're done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey ARK, can you put on your trip and derail this thread, I need it to hit 404 faster.</br>  <br>Kind of how like Shinji became less suicidal and learn to like and love others. Asuka would learn she doesn't to put up a front with everyone and they're relationship would have developed more.</br>  <br>What's there to derail? It started shit and it's still shit.</br>  <br>If you've understood this thread is a what if scenario, then why would he have to leave it? <br>Please go away.</br></br>  <br>No kidding, I'm just hoping some retard starts barking at your trip again because this doesn't look like it's going to 404 anytime soon. It'd be better than shipshit anyhow.</br>  <br>Being a sibling means having a common parent, the familial definition includes being raised together. You're siblings then. <br><br>But you know what, it's obvious you're some sort of shit-tier kaworufag or something who doesn't even know left from right. <br><br>I'm not your fucking sibling, nor are you mine, just because we're both human.<br><br>Again there's just nothing here backing you up whatsoever, so keep your shitty fantasy theory to yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>does he have a hospital fetish or something?</br>  <br> It says there's multiple seeds out there <br>All either possessing fruit of knowledge or fruit of life. There's no variety. They all act the same according to their fruit as the Dead Sea Scrolls state. All the seeds are siblings in this manner.<br><br> Because we obviously aren't, neither are they. <br>In Eva, the lilin are all siblings in some manner; they're made by the same mother. Just like the angels are all siblings in that manner. In the real world, we're all related; tracing back to our ancestors from the beginning of the human race makes us siblings by definition.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> let me spew my shitty fanfiction on /a/ without consequence <br>You're the one that needs to leave.</br></br>  <br> Rei <br> The Bandages <br>  Episode 01 <br><br>This explains so much</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All humans can trace their family tree back to a surprisingly small group of common ancestors. Every person on Earth's most recent common ancestor might have died less than 2000 years ago. <br>We're all technically related.</br></br>  <br>I wasnt even the anon in  you idiot.<br>You're just stupid and wrong.</br></br>  <br>Well, I was going to watch anime, but I guess I could just turn it into an Asuka thread. Turning shit threads into Asuka image dumps is a thing I tend to do, after all.<br><br>Any objections?</br></br></br>  <br>No use arguing with him. He's pure, deluded cancer.</br>  <br> you're just stupid and wrong <br> as he posts a non/a/ image </br></br>  <br> All either possessing fruit of knowledge or fruit of life. There's no variety. <br>You just described a variety you fucking moron.<br><br> All the seeds are siblings in this manner. <br>In what manner, existing? None of they are siblings, nor are they ever described as such.<br><br> In Eva, the lilin are all siblings in some manner; they're made by the same mother. <br>No, they aren't. Siblings is reserved for the same generation from the same parent. They are not siblings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why isn't anyone answering OP's topic? It's a pretty interesting concept and discussion.  <br> MEIN FRAULEIN <br><br>I'll join you</br></br></br>  <br> inb4 some anon shitposts about Shinji meaning absolutely nothing to Asuka </br>  <br>Subtle samefag there.</br>  <br>Which has nothing to do with being a sibling or not.<br><br>Take a hint leave retard. Even ARK sperging out is better than your shit.<br><br>Try /cm/, it's where the scum gathers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not, nobody gives a shit about Asuka beyond masturbation material. She has zero potential as a protagonist.</br>  <br>Go right ahead. Getting real tired of all the shit threads lately. I mean, most threads are shit, but the last two have been cancer down to the marrow.</br>  <br>I wish for autistic idiots like him to just stop polluting threads, is all.<br><br>My god you're retarded, was that your best retort? Just refrain from spreading anymore of your autism. Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Alright, here you go. Trip stays on because fuck it.<br><br>Any outfit requests?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if you don't like or agree with them as a romantic pairing, the only people who don't think they care about eachother are the most butthurt of the Kaworu-fags.</br>    <br> You just described a variety you fucking moron. <br>Not much of a variety if all the fruits of life are exactly alike and all the fruit of knowledge are exactly alike.<br> None of they are siblings, nor are they ever described as such. <br>They are created by the same entities as a means of said entities trying to preserve their race. They are essentially the remnants of the FAR.<br> Siblings is reserved for the same generation from the same parent. <br>And Lilith is their parent. She's able to rebirth them with no problem in EoE.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's go with the plugsuit to start us off then.</br>  <br>cAsualsuka is best Asuka</br>  <br>Do you normally choke and defile people you care about, anon-kun?</br>  <br>How would /a/ be different if Asuka had been Moot?</br>    It would be the same story, just with less Shinji, so it would be better. <br><br>Wait, does this mean Asuka would schlick to a comatose Shinji?</br></br>  <br> Not much of a variety if all the fruits of life are exactly alike and all the fruit of knowledge are exactly alike. <br><br>You have one of each, which doesn't give you grounds to say that. Also, good job evading the "no variety" bullshit you tried to spew.<br><br> They are created by the same entities as a means of said entities trying to preserve their race. They are essentially the remnants of the FAR. <br>Nothing of this implies siblings or sibling status. <br><br> And Lilith is their parent. She's able to rebirth them with no problem in EoE. <br>Each have their own mothers and fathers, Asuka has hers, Shinji has his, and the only sibling example we have is Toji and his sister.<br><br>Don't you ever, ever get tired of being wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Getting real tired of all the shit threads lately. I mean, most threads are shit, but the last two have been cancer down to the marrow. <br><br>Blame the Kaworufags. They're so insecure they can't stand the idea of Shinji liking anyone in addition to their husbando. They insist on shitposting in every NGE thread to "prove" something everyone already knows, and when canon material isn't enough the start ranting about unused material and spinoffs because they want Shinji to exclusively lust after Kaworu.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll start there then<br><br><br>Casual later. Any request on colors of outfits?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes.<br><br>You don't behead them though.</br></br></br>  <br>You didn't answer the question.<br><br>Do you have autism, aspergers or something?<br><br><br>Fucking this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Man, Captcha sure is being a bitch.  <br>Asking the right questions</br>  <br>The whole point of a hedgehog's dilemma is that we hurt the people we care about the most, through our imperfections as human beings.</br>    <br>You switch to Legacy yet?</br>  <br>This, plus one really bad Asukafag that decides to drop by some times despite being banned and hated in more threads than just the Eva threads, the waifu threads for instance can't stand his guts.</br>    <br><br> You have one of each, which doesn't give you grounds to say that.  <br>The Dead Sea Scrolls treats them as the exact same thing. Kaworu even meets another seed in NGE2 and it looks exactly like him.<br> Nothing of this implies siblings or sibling status.  <br>It's the closest to siblings as aliens can get. They're objectively related.<br> Each have their own mothers and fathers <br>They're all under the category of Lilin, just one measly angel. <br>Also, thanks for never answering this:<br> Why would the union between Adam and Lilith be considered 'forbidden'? Why did Sadamoto bother to make them look so similar? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Hedgehogs don't have the hedgehog's dilemma. It's complete phsychology fiction.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br>Yeah. For some reason it thought I was typing numbers incorrectly. Combine that with shit internet upload speeds and I stay silent for a while.<br><br>At least it becomes a lot easier to cue up multiple posts at once now, so I'll take the occasional hiccup.</br></br></br>  <br>Cosign.<br><br>Here's more based Asuka.</br></br></br>  <br> not understanding metaphors </br>    <br>Some fictitious Asukafag a Reifag has been pretending to be because no one was believing him earlier.</br>  <br> not understanding that most psychology older than 2000s is compltetely outdated shit made by morons without a real education </br>  <br> The Dead Sea Scrolls treats them as the exact same thing. <br>In the same way law or any document who refers to people treats them the same.<br><br> Kaworu even meets another seed in NGE2 and it looks exactly like him. <br>Because he took his form, and NOT-CANON-ALERT anyway.<br><br>Are you going to bring up ANIMA next?<br><br> It's the closest to siblings as aliens can get. They're objectively related. <br>In other words, not siblings. They don't even come close FYI, and "coming close" is not siblings either.<br><br> They're all under the category of Lilin, just one measly angel.  <br>One measly Angel who is a collective, and in which the term "sibling" applies. <br><br> hurr durr y u no answer this <br>Because I don't see it anywhere in your post, and there's nothing there that makes iether of them siblings. Sadamoto doens't make them any more similar, a wig on Shinji looks more like Rei than a wig on Kaworu.<br><br>It's just retarded reaching and apparently, you don't get tired of being wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka would probably kill herself after falling in love with albino Kaji, only to be rejected and abandoned.</br>    <br><br>Nice try Asukafag, but you're well known.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127442<wbr>348/#127478910_3089</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I'd believe he's an Asukafag. He's probably the same as the skeletonposter a while back. It's kind of entertaining watching him consistently get shot down by mods/janitors every single time.<br><br><br>Freud was right, you know.</br></br></br></br>    <br>And what is this?</br>  I'm about to watch the Rebuilds but I don't get it. Are 1.0 and 1.11 the same or different? How does it work?    <br>So I'm assuming a 2007 experimental study from The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology about the hedgehogs dilemma isn't current enough for you?<br><br>www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Maner20<wbr>07.pdf<br><br><br>Freud might not have been, but Schopenhauer may well have been. He's still relevant mostly because he was a philosopher and not a doctor like Freud.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>The difference is between theatrical and home release. Watch the .11/.22/.33 versions. Wait for people to yell at you for watching them in the first place.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/126269<wbr>133/#126274556<br><br>This guy, I think. Notice how he admits to shitposting later down in the thread and talks about "retiring" some images so he won't get caught.<br><br>There's no repentance even after he's exposed, there's no self insight, it's like it's a retard-faggot asukafag machine.<br><br>This guy: <br>why tries to pretend it's not a known fact might even be that guy (or a sad, misguided asuka fag). <br><br>It's maximum autism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>it's because OP replies to himself</br></br>    <br>Well I've been avoiding watching them since I finished the series &amp; EoE. But I need more Eva in my life.</br>  <br> In the same way law or any document who refers to people treats them the same. <br>It's written by their very parents, they would know better than anyone<br> Because he took his form <br>No, that's literally what he looked like<br> In other words, not siblings.  <br>They're more like siblings than Shinji and Rei, which was my original post anyhow. They're related, Sadamoto even says they have the same DNA which is why they both have red eyes.<br>Thanks for still not answering these:<br> Why would the union between Adam and Lilith be considered 'forbidden'? <br> Why does Rei keep saying that they are the same? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ghostposts in waifufag threads. Picked a semi-recent one, you can go backwards in history and see the same shitposting over and over again.<br><br>I think he got banned (still posts on his phone as he calls it), so that's why he posts there.<br><br>If we could remove this guy and a handful of the Kaworufags, we'd be back on track for better EVA-threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the samefagging on that post </br>  <br>Freud did a pretty good job for a guy completely out of his field.<br><br>Philosophy's solid, though.

Don't expect more of the same, though. You'll just be disappointed.</br>  <br>Thanks for conceding like usual.</br>  <br>Looking at the times, it can't be samefagging.</br>    <br>Well I know that they should be considered separate. But will watching them possibly ruin how I feel about the original series?</br>  <br>Some retard LASfag posted a bunch a while back. I think he got bullied off the board.</br>  <br>Did you watch Death &amp; Rebirth?<br>Did you read the manga?<br>Did you read Angelic Days?<br>Did you read Campus Apocalypse?<br>Did you play Girlfriend of Steel?<br>Did you play the NGE PS2 games?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do when they ask you to.</br>  <br>Only if you let them. I watch Rebuild for music/action/see more of the characters I like doing things. As long as you keep it separate, you should be fine.

Haute couture is fashion that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Couture translates literally from French as "dressmaking", but may also refer to fashion, sewing, or needlework and is also used as a common abbreviation of haute couture and refers to the same thing in spirit. Haute translates literally to "high". A haute couture garment is often made for a client, tailored specifically for the wearer's measurements and body stance. Considering the amount of time, money, and skill that is allotted to each completed piece, haute couture garments are also described as having no price tag</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127762495 <br> BOOYAH <br>it's not 2003 anymore grandpa</br></br>  <br>Dont make hit those showers.</br>  <br> raccoon <br><br> racoon <br>Raccoon Dog<br>Tanuki are a canid, related to foxes, wolves and anon's pet poodle.<br>The only thing they have in common with raccoons, is a dark mask around the eyes, and the fact that basic taxonomy isn't popular with subbers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> grandpa <br>He was pretty obviously 13.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127762495 <br> moeshit <br>Back to your Junjo Romantica containment thread</br></br>  <br>I seriously hope this is pasta or I'll label you a faggot right here and now.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute<wbr>_couture</wbr></br>  <br>Not enough buckets to catch the rainwater.

Nobody's judging you here  faggot. </br>  <br> Nobody's judging <br><br>I am. <br><br><br>Fuck off back to /mlp/ you ESL retard. Don't sully NNB threads with your faggotry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot Renge was in school in the first season so I was lost for the first few minutes.</br>  <br>I thought maybe she was in kindergarten in S1. I didn't understand it was a prequel until anons pointed it out.</br>    <br>Hotaru moving should have clued you in.</br>  <br> until anons pointed it out <br>Until Hotaru appeared, I might understand, but you had to have it pointed out to you?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm sorry, I'm a little slow on the uptake.</br></br>  <br><br> Try F5 as well. </br></br>  <br>2nded<br><br>until the end</br></br></br>  Why does the NNB universe always shits on Hikage? She just wanted to be cool god dammit.  <br>Maybe she should stop trying so hard and being a braggart.</br>  <br>You want her to be cool? Fuck her. That way she can go home and brag about losing her virginity to all the innocent little country girls who will look up to her like a mature adult.</br>  <br> bragging about losing your virginity <br><br>no, that'd be komari</br></br></br>  <br>It'd be both. <br><br>Man, I wish I lived there.</br></br></br>  Why does she wear the mask?  <br>I've been reading alot of comments about this. Is this show subtlety meant to be dark? Or are people just trying to nit pick on everything which can support it being dark?</br>  <br>It is kind of dark at times.</br>  <br>it's not dark at all. posting edgy theories about NNB has become a meme at this point</br>  It's like show is trying to tell me that living in a rural area is great.  <br>Just like how other school anime tell you that you will have a harem when going into highschool.</br>    <br>It actually happens in Japanese highschools. The girls there all want to fuck antisocial nerds.</br>  <br>me neither, i forgot the entire season 1</br>  <br>Why does this happen?</br>  <br><br>Anon why don't you check it out and see for yourself? Also, it's spelled subtly. <br><br> and it's not dark at all, it's peaceful and beautiful and often genuinely funny. </br></br></br></br>  <br>My mind went blank when Hotaru talked about making friends</br>  <br>Natsumi pls</br>  <br><br>It doesn't, baka.</br></br>     OP by nano.RIPE <br><br>So funky</br></br>  <br>Good one.</br>  <br> mfw I didn't realize until the end </br>  <br>The story of my life.</br>  <br>Then where did the harem genre come from? It must have been influence by something.</br>  <br>Non Non Biyori is way more subtle about it. <br><br>The girls don't repeat that they love that place and would never want to live anywhere else etc. like it happenes quite often in anime - Lagrange, Oorai. <br><br>It's just the place where they live their youth.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you slow, anon? It was influenced by something alright. The universal fantasies of lonely antisocial nerds everywhere, (and specifically in Japan).</br></br>  <br>and where did the fantasies of lonely antisocial nerds came from? They must have been influenced by something as well.</br>  <br><br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>What do you mean nope?</br>  <br><br>I mean I'll not be gently trolled any further. I clearly need to sleep.</br></br>  <br>I too won't be tricked any further, I'll just take  as fact and move on.</br>  Why are they so autistic?  <br>artistic?</br>  <br/>  <br>That's what happens when you grow up in an isolated rural area sorely lacking in other people your age to interact with.  I should know. </br>  Since when does CR put honorifics in their subs? Kind of an improvement.  <br>When the joke requires it.</br>  <br>I think it varies between shows, probably depends on the individual doing the translating, but I think I've been noticing them more.<br><br>except this whole episode used honorifics.</br></br></br>  <br>well it could have been "Ms. Renge," "Lady Renge," "Renge Your Majesty" or some bullshit. I can think of a few fansub groups who have done that kind of thing.</br>  <br>It varies hugely by show. They tend to keep them for shows set in Japan and drop them in fantasy/foreign settings or something.</br>  <br>Varies by audience. They know NNB is patrician shit so their viewers will understand basic stuff like honorifics and don't need to be spoonfed.</br>  <br>Nobody would use any of these to address elementary students on an opening ceremony. You can't translate it.  Unless the -san is not standard in these ceremonies. </br>  <br>An actual patrician wouldn't need somebody else to tell him what people in his cartoon are saying.</br>    <br>plz no bully</br>  The marching in the OP is one of the cutest scenes I've ever seen  <br>Did Koma-chan go on a diet?</br>  Is this anime original? <br>When's Okinawa?</br>  <br>More importantly, did Hotaru put on weight? She looks even more deliciously plump than usual</br>  What is haute couture?  <br><br>No.</br></br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br>you almost got me there</br></br>    <br>She's such a spaz.</br>  <br>I didn't realize it until after I watched it, went on /a/ and someone mentioned it.</br>  <br>It took me till I saw Hotaru to realize. <br> tfw I made forum posts about it <br> tfw I didn't know if s2 would just be a repeat of s1 </br></br></br>  <br>It's a cute show with some dark commentary on the depopulation of Japanese countryside under the surface.</br>  <br> not going full pregnant </br>  <br>Official art is always so shitty.</br>  Why doesn't the sensei just take Ren-chan to school? Ren always wakes up earlier anyway.  <br>What would she do while she waited several hours for school to start?</br>  <br>Play around near the school. The same kind of things she always does when she's home.</br>  <br> play <br>What is this "play" you speak of ?</br></br>  Speaking like that is bad manners you rude little kid.  Watching this anime I can't help but raise a simple fundamental question<br><br>Why do they even live there in the first place?<br>No job opportunity<br>No entertainment<br>No civilization<br>No anything new whatever<br>And hell even no education opportunity for children. Just imagine how much will this kids have to miss in their youth for the sake of living in this nowhere shithole<br><br>Seriously, why do they do it? Is it a medieval age where they can't move to other place without the lord's permission?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>their parents are farmers</br>  On my tenth rewatch now.<br><br>This shit is addicting.</br></br>  <br><br>Dude in not even 10 minutes they can to other town/cities.<br><br>It's the same where I live.<br><br>In 5 minutes I can to other towns and in 10 to cities (and in 30 to the biggest city in the region)<br><br> Seriously, why do they do it? <br><br>Try to use your brain a little more, that's all I can recommend to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can go to tokyo if they want I guess, but the education and the jobs that they can get are OK.<br>The lack of males is a problem though.</br></br>  <br><br>Your world is so small m8.</br></br>  <br> The lack of males is a problem though. <br>There are many males in the village, they just aren't shown.</br></br>  <br> a rural Japanese town <br> single-carriage diesel train (yes, unelectrified) coming once in an hour <br> can get to other town in 10 minues <br><br>I don't think so. The rural-ness of the town of NNB is simply beyond imagination. Can't even use a mobile phone? Holy shit<br><br><br>Not at all. What kind of facilities have you see in NNB beside that almost ran-down school and bloody farms beyond farms. Both job and education hitting the bare minimum level, /a/non, even worse than such place in  Wales </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ARE my methods... "unsound"? <br> I don't see any method at all, sir. </br></br>  <br><br> &gt;single-carriage diesel train (yes, unelectrified) coming once in an hour <br><br>So? We don't even have that shit here.<br><br>What are cars, bikes etc.<br><br> I don't think so <br><br>Read the manga or keep watching the anime and see for yourself.<br><br> Both job and education hitting the bare minimum level <br><br>See pic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're right, all the farmers should live in cities and farm crops on thier lawn.</br></br>   expecting cute slice of life <br> this happens https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=44b<wbr>4Zxw6agg</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>fucking anime im done</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody would use any of these to address elementary students on an opening ceremony. <br>No one would use sama or dono either.</br></br>  Who is she talking to?  <br>Me.</br>  That little gasp, she's too adorable.  <br>This guy </br>  <br>I want to motorboat Komari's belly.</br>    <br>What will the kids miss out on? They have friends to play with, a school that will give them some education and they will probably learn what they need from their parents about farming.</br>  Anyone have fanart of grown up Renge-chon?   1st episode was a prequel <br> and it was Renchon's episode <br><br>Insta AOTS.</br></br></br>  <br>3/10 slightly funny</br>  <br>2spooky4me.</br>  <br>It's a private school. They don't have access to government money.</br>  <br>You worry somewhat about Hotarun, though. Her family is obviously educated and well-to-do, and I can't see them intending for her to be a farmer or to operate a tiny local shop. What's she going to do on her middle school and high school exams? She'd probably get sent back to the city before long.</br>  <br>Why worry about the worst girl?</br>  <br>Maybe her family has debts and ran away so they don't have to sell Hotarun to the Yakuza.</br>  <br>Ever heard of a housewife?</br>  I thought she was saying horticulture.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127776720 <br>Renge's not a crack baby though.</br>  <br>Where did she even learn that term?</br>  <br>Variety shows on TV or a stray magazine?</br>   Can say haute coture <br> Can't say Fancy </br>  <br>Look at this fag.<br><br><br>I can see her getting her MRS degree at college, but being a housewife to a bumpkin farmer in the middle of nowhere is a social dead-end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mispelled Komari</br>  <br>Someone's got to repopulate their countryside.</br>  What's Hotaru's Dad's job that they ended up in the sticks anyway? And they have a nice house so it probably pays well.  <br>She couldn't remember what the word was, dickhead.</br>  <br>He pimps out his wife and daughter to ugly fat farmers.</br>  <br>My case still stands.<br> Can remember haute coture <br> Can't remember fancy </br></br></br>  <br>What's your point?</br>  <br>He's a yuppie and he moved out to the sticks to build a dungeon to imprison little girls.</br>  <br>Forgive her, she's autistic.</br>  <br>She's six.</br>  <br>That's called purity, anon.<br><br>Getto?</br></br></br>  <br>Ghetto?</br>  You will literally never ever have a happy, cozy childhood like hers, or live anywhere as comfy<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Q3_<wbr>0YmqrkIA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>He watched too much NNB on TV.</br>  <br>He's in charge of closing down their village.</br>  <br>Probably an engineer or manager for one of the public utilities like the phones, transit or power.<br>And the transfer is a white lie for Hotaru's sake. He asked to be transferred in order to get Hotaru out of the city before she was raped or propositioned to be a gravure idol.</br></br>  <br>hika-nee, denwa</br>  My biggest question is why the school is so big if only 4 people assist to it, actually, why are only 4 people assisting to school to begin with? the town doesnt seem that small, and people fuck more in the woods, it should be at least a dozen or two  <br>doesn't japan have real low crime rates?</br>  <br>There used to be more people but they all moved out.</br>  <br>More like they all got old and didn't have enough kids.</br>  <br>That's an inevitable end.</br>  <br>Japan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. Schools are shutting down all over the country because no one has any children</br>  <br>Never</br>  <br> in this nowhere shithole <br>You sure aren't from Russia. You know nothing about shitholes.</br></br>  <br> 21st Century <br> housewife <br><br>kek.gif<br><br>But that being said, I know there is a wide variety of economic condition among countries</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there's plenty of worse places to live like India, Syria, or Somalia. those places make Russia look like a heaven.</br>  <br>Not THAT low anon. Especially involving sex crimes. And Hotaru is a walking target.<br>And the thing is, Hotaru's parents could have cashed in and made a good bit of money, like the parents of the girl Hotaru is modeled after did when they signed her up to be a swimsuit model at 11.</br></br>  <br>Why is she always so sad?</br>  <br>She watched Kill la Kill.</br>  <br>Because her father does things to her</br>  <br> Especially involving sex crimes <br><br>Simply nope. Japan has one of the lowest crime rates ESPECIALLY involving sex crimes and is certainly the safest place for children, far safer than those countries condemning Japan for m-muh child porn, ironically</br></br></br>  <br><br>Japanese society has low REPORTED crime rates, due to ingrained social pressures and values. <br>You have to use your brain to examine the truth behind the numbers.</br></br></br>  <br>preteen and teenage idol videos are my antidrug<br><br><br>I bet you think black people don't deserve to be profiled and that you need to look behind the numbers to find out the truth</br></br></br></br>  <br> Japanese society has low REPORTED crime rates, due to ingrained social pressures and values. <br><br> Hrrdrr I somehow know all about UNREPORTED crimes! Don't ask me how I'm supposed to know something unreported though <br> Oh and yes every other countries on the Earth have 100% crime report rate so it's only Japan's problem! <br><br>What kind of stupidity is this?<br><br> You have to use your brain to examine the truth behind the numbers. <br><br>More like your fucking fantasy, yeah<br><br><br>Oh wait, am I replying to a bait?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   no cell phone service <br><br>what kind of backwoods town do they live in?</br></br>    <br>And to get her away from the people who make and buy those videos are why Hotaru's parents moved to the country. Whether the police consider it a threat or not, Hotaru's parents clearly did.</br>  <br>I remember you in a previous thread. The word you're looking for is "attend," not "assist to," ESL-kun.</br>  <br>Being a housewife/mother is still the main ambition of most azn women.</br>  <br>It was true until the late nineties but not nowadays.</br>  <br>She doesn't have any friends her age.</br>  For anyone interested I scanned some of the setting materials I got from S1 of NNB earlier<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/LMimQ#0</br></br>  <br>Less to do with backwards and more to do with the mountains all those families own.<br>They block cell phone signals and require a larger number of towers to provide service for the same surface area. And there are not enough people in that area to pay for the extra towers. If japan.gov doesn't pay for it, it won't get done.<br>Also, people like Renge's granddad who own mountains, want money from the telecom companies to put those towers on their land and build service roads to them. They consider the phone company to be a cash cow and demand astronomical sums for a lease.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Happens pretty often in regions with hills and mountains, you get little local dead spots everywhere. The cell sizes in rural areas are pretty large too, which makes things worse.</br></br>  <br>I'd do things to her too</br>  <br> women start to assert themselves more in the workforce <br> economy crashes and goes into a perpetual recession as a result </br></br>  <br>If Japan.gov was really concerned about their rural communities, that is the first thing that they should fix. Extend modern telecom services to the declining rural areas and subsidize them until the user base catches up. Because even if a business was eager to move into the countryside, it is not able to with cell phone holes and no 4G support for smartphones. No one anymore is going to move a office or plant out to a town that suffers from those conditions.</br>  <br>Japan has a low reported crime rate.</br>  <br> women start to assert themselves more in the workforce <br> economy crashes and goes into a perpetual recession as a result <br><br>What kind of weed are you smoking?</br></br></br></br>    <br>What kind of things?</br>  <br>Yet has to have women only carriages on inter city rail lines...</br>  <br>It goes hand-in-hand so yeah, crime rate is low in Japan. Just look at all these videos on Youtube about daily life in Japan.</br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br>how fucking retarded are you?</br>  <br><br> Trying to lure "Healing anime" viewers to watching a "loli gets mutilated the animee" <br>What kind of monster are you?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually most of Japanese women still have kids, they just rarely have more than one.</br>  <br><br> what is a joke </br></br>  <br>Why would it matter?

Japan's abortion rate is probably high but not so different than Northern Europe.</br>  <br>its just a meme but there are some sort of dark scenes in the show but its just what kids talk about every now and then<br><br>like the scene where Natsumi wonders that since ghosts arent real what happens after you die</br></br></br>  Why is Renge so genuinely sexy?  <br> tfw I have no cellphone </br>  <br> has to have <br>You don't know that.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, but I want to marry her.</br>  <br> What kind of stupidity is this? <br>Pretty simple, it's the kind of "another country can't do something better than the place I'm living in" stupidity.</br></br>  Did Nii-chan sing the school song?  <br>409568540 hours in GIMP</br>  <br>He played the piano.</br>  <br>Google chikan.

Back in the day you spent 12-14 hours each day at work + nomikai + commuting. You were barely at home to even sleep.</br></br></br>  <br>The schools closing are normal, though. During Japan's baby boom they were shitting out so many kids that even with the fuckton of school they built they still had to implement extremely tough entry exams and cram schools because there were so many kids trying to go to school.<br><br>Now that the boom is over they have no need for all those schools. As a result entrance exams are a lot less demanding as well so Japanese students don't have to spend every minute of the day studying anymore.<br><br>Really until Japan starts letting the Filippinos in, the population and economy will remain stagnant.</br></br></br></br></br>  whens kaede  <br><br>That makes it even sexier you pleb</br></br>  <br>I assumed it was Kindergarten Renge was in at the time.

Philippine was literally leading the pack in Asia after WWII. They then proceed to fuck themselves into a 3rd world country. That should tell you enough about the nature of their people. And you're crazy if you think yamato-damashi-nipponjin would want a huge population of this stock mixing within their boarder.<br><br>I'm sorry if I've offended you if you're actually a Filipino. But if you lived in Philippine, you know shit's true.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not Filipino so you're not offending me.

But not their economy that's been stagnant for 20 years.

And should I be at a certain vocabulary level before I go beyond the basic grammar stuff w/ Tae Kim or is it more of a "everyone learns differently" situation all around?  <br>just be yourself</br>  <br>Okay yeah I kinda felt like those were stupid subjective questions to ask anyways, but I've gotten through most of the basic grammar in the last two days so I just wasn't sure if I was rushing through or what.</br>  <br>It's fine to read through it that quickly, but unlikely you "learned" it that fast. It's something you can go back to repeatedly as you forget it.<br><br>But really you can take your time to some extent - you aren't really going to be able to read anything without finishing about Core2k anyway, so just aim to get Tae Kim as solid as possible around the time you add the last cards from Core2k</br></br></br>  <br>Don't do this. Without fail every time you tell yourself you don"t need to learn something it'll bite you in the ass. Soon it'll be like oh I don't need this or this and so on, then at that point you aren't even learning anymore. And whats more so is those readings actually show up depending on the writer. The safest and certain way that'll help you the most is to learn every reading and instance of the character.<br><br>As an example 有り難う.

Bet most people here probably don't know what the fuck this is <br>Fuck off you tard.</br></br>  <br>掛かる is written as かかる more than enough to justify not including 掛かる for beginners. Textbooks aren't supposed to be highly inclusive and they only usually cover vocabulary related to both the reading level and grammar covered in the text. It wouldn't make a lot of sense for an introductory text book including something the student likely isn't going to come across before progressing to the next text book or something they aren't going to be able to look up themselves. <br><br>I think you might be out of touch with what an introductory text is designed to do.</br></br></br>  <br>VNs don't use baby Japanese.

On top of that a large portion of the VN demographic target market for the medium are adults.<br><br>People who are using beginner textbooks to study Japanese aren't reading VNs.

I studied 166 cards today and I'm 24% through the deck.  <br>200-250 at a 85% retention rate. As a rule of thumb, the amount of reviews is roughly 10x the amount of new cards you do per day.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks.</br>  <br>You could say this of every counter in the language, since they could all technically be replaced by つ.

I'm just saying that by his logic, every counter is as bad as 冊 so there's no reason to pick on it in particular.</br>  <br> If you answer にあらず to that you're probably past Tae Kim <br>How would one come to that conclusion? If <br> Conjugating to the negative state-of-being <br>is the only thing on the front it could mean dozens of things. Are we talking about nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.?

You don't need more of a reason than that. <br><br>This is just my opinion, but I think you're probably seeing it as unnecessary because you think having a kanji just for that small purpose is too big a price to pay in exchange for a little bit of precision, but that's just your bias because you're having to learn a bunch of kanji in a short period of time, so it seems to you like having less Kanji would be a great advantage, when it really wouldn't be so in the big picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just stick the english sentence on the front</br>  <br>Maybe?

Then after you can read and type, you can try to figure out how to write. If you want<br>t. japanese expert</br></br>  <br>For learning Japanese you need to get to reading with a dictionary level as soon as possible. It should only take a month if you're NEET. Learn grammar and vocabulary. RTK is a waste of time, it will make it take 4 times longer to get to that level with little benefit. Only use it if you really can't remember kanji to save your life. I think most people wouldn't need it. It's kind of a crutch for retards, who end up focusing on nothing but it and then never learning any japanese, like most of the people on koohi.</br>  <br>thanks, I'll bookmark it.<br><br>Although I'm not worried about being bored, I'm just tired of people labeling parts of sentences like "the limiter" and the "key word" and shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Just watch it in 200%, it's more realistic that way anyway.</br>  <br> because seriously fuck kanji <br>It just takes time and patience to learn, all you need is some self discipline and they're a piece of cake. I'd avoid this spiteful attitude towards kanji, cause it will probably work against you. Love the Kanji, man. They're actually really great. Nothing feels better than being able to fluidly read a script which uses over 2000 different characters. <br><br>Also, don't worry about their pronunciation. You'll learn that as you learn actual words. However, I'd recommend going into vocabulary sooner rather than later. Don't wait until you've learned 2000 kanji to start learning words. Once you've got a grasp on the basic radicals and how they're used to form kanji you could already start working on your vocab cause you'll already be prepared to look at a kanji the way it should be looked at and not just as a bunch of scribbles.<br><br>Anyway, congratulations on making it so far, but be warned, the further you go the slower your progress will be. The most frustrating part of learning Japnese is the long stretch after you've gone through the initial steps in which you feel like you're making tons of progress and before you actually reach a decent, working level where you can use the language fluidly.<br><br>Finally<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KxG<wbr>Rhd_iWuE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, I used anki to review hiragana and katakana and it was a big help.<br><br>So I used the pasta and installed the "Kore 2k/6k Optimized Japanese Vocabulary" cards and it's just too fucking much for me.

I'm a failure as a learner.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 雪 <br>Eminem standing in the rain, would he be cooler it would snow.</br></br>  <br>READ MORE</br>  <br>You could quit using the ridiculous self-pity act as an excuse for your laziness, stop being a sorry little shit and finish what you started instead of throwing all of this time you already dedicated to Japanese in the garbage.</br>   127794336 <br>so what would that look like? <br>この本は田中さんが借りたんです <br>この本は田中さんに借りられたんです<br><br>either of these work?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically you have only studied properly since 2013, with the latter majority of that time spent only doing SRS, no actual experience using the language. What did you expect? You can never be able to read a VN or watch anime doing anki alone, you need to actually practice what you have learned using anki on real-world materials. And you can't skimp on grammar either, tae kim is not enough to properly read something like a VN.<br><br>And besides, two years is nothing anyway, even if you had studied properly you would still be long ways from fluency. <br><br>Basically, you can learn Japanese if you want, but you need to 1) diversify your studying, and 2) have patience</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have things you want to read?</br>  I hate mnemonic sentences and the people who use them. I'm prepared to recognize their empirical value as a tool for learning Japanese, but I won't stop hating them and the lot of you.  Do you read shoujo?  <br>Yes, for romance drama. Reverse harem is not for me.</br>  Since I'm a sucker for romance, yes.<br><br>Though since I'm very picky when it comes to art, physically allergic to drama and not at all interested to shit like love triangles I only read the remaining like 5% of it.</br></br>  <br>Yes, for comedy.</br>  <br>Are you me, nice trips-kun?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Femwhores fuck off.<br>Stop polluting my /a/ with your disgusting roasties and shit taste.<br>Shoujo is trash for whores.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this.<br><br>Also, is actual romance really that hard to write?<br>It's always either<br>drama and triangles for girls or<br>ecchi and harems for boys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stop liking what I don't like! </br>  I'm not a girl, so no.  <br>Fuck off femwhore, I'm keeping /a/ pure from sluts like you.<br>Go suck off Chad or something.</br></br>  <br>I would say that they are hard to write. Doubly so if you are going to make the manga run longer than 10 chapters.<br><br>Without DRAMA, there would be no reason that the characters that love each-other couldn't get together. Since romance tends to focus on overcoming the obstacles that get in the way of true love, there need to be said obstacles. Which tend to be love triangles and drama, as they are at least somewhat realistic (also an easy go-to).<br>If there were no love triangles/harems/drama we would end up with ore monogatari, which I enjoy, but if every romance were like it, it would be awful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Romance is best when it is either a secondary plot or just a part of the main plot. Take Taiyou no Ie for example. The romance is there, the love triangle bullshit is solved almost immediately and the romance is accompanied by the themes of family.</br>  <br>Nope.<br><br>I read josei.</br></br></br>  <br>Flap your curtains and fly away, roastie.</br>  i'm amazed at how brutally honest jap women are with their submission/rape fetishes<br><br>most shoujo/smut manga would be seen as BDSM here<br><br>typical shinjo mayu plot<br> heroine gets "raped" by bishounen who only did it because he loves her <br> girl thinking "why does it feel so good even though it's rape" <br> somewhere along the line a rival interest appears who isn't dominant and agressive as the main rapist <br> girl rejects him for the rapist </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>/r9k/ seems to be really popular lately.</br></br>  <br>You just described every single shoujo/josei manga ever.<br>They're all fucking trash for hyper-sexual, unfaithul 3DPD sluts.</br></br>  <br>I forgot, I also dislike the typical borderline-rapist male shoujo lead whose facial expression constantly looks like someone is dangling feces under his nose.</br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>Sometimes. Mostly Kaori Yuki.</br>  Yeah, love it. I think this is what got me into other genres to begin with. <br>Right now I am reading this josei manhwa called "Cheese in the Trap" and I can't get over it.<br>So fucking good.</br></br>  <br>This nigger knows what's up. <br><br>There are very few decent romances. I liked Last game, but then we got a love triangle. <br><br>Horimiya is probably the best romance manga I've read, though it's shoujo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with love triangle, it just there to spice things up or when author doesn't have any idea how to make things progress. Well executed love triangle drama would be fun to read.</br>  <br>I loved Kimi ni Todoke, but that's about it.</br>  <br>Wow, you like the most garbage shoujo series ever. Congratulations anon.</br>  <br>Turbo-slut detected.<br>Go back to your rape fantasies, whore.</br></br>  <br>The problem is that they aren't well executed most of the time. <br><br>Also they always create an unsatisfying conclusion.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the majority of what I read because it's less trite. In Shounen it's gotten to the point where I can tell a character's role and personality just from the order in which they're introduced in the story.</br>  <br>Western women are learning to be honest with themselves, see 50 Shades. In fact, I think the only reason western women were ignored was that entertainment is overwhelming male, written by men and targeted to men, while Japan has always had female writers. See Genji Monogatari</br>  <br>Just because I don't like reading garbage? I'm sorry, landwhale.</br>  <br>It's always nice guy vs asshole and we'll know the asshole will win, no matter how much he fuck up or how much merits the nice guy make.</br>  <br>Shoujo is extremely derivative too. Maybe even more than shounen.</br>  <br>Shojo is always overrated. Boring, same story last forever.</br>  <br>No it's not. <br><br><br>No it's not.</br></br></br></br>  <br> landwhale in denial </br>  Sometimes if I'm in the mood for it. The love triangles are pretty bad though and I don't mind the drama when its not shitty. <br><br>Reverse harems are alright. I want all the boys to win.</br></br>  <br> autistic cunt shitposting </br>  <br>Fuck off back to /cgl/.</br>  <br>Shoujo only exist to provide plots to J-dramas or teen flicks</br>  <br>Go back to /v/.</br>  <br>Shojo manga sometimes become big in Japan because it is easy to make media mix like drama. <br>I like のだめカンタービレ drama but hey, its manga original story is shit. Actually, shojo manga and its drama version's story is completely different oftenly.</br></br>  <br>what the fuck is wrong with that guy's face.</br>  Japanese entertainment is fucked up in general. The economical recession killed creativity and the chance of taking risks, now everyone want to play safe. Shoujo just happened to get the worst part because Hana Yori Dango and Japanese sexism  <br> first post Wed 08 Jul 2015  <br><br>This is the kind of people who browses /a/ nowdays?</br></br></br>  <br>You first femslut.<br>Maybe you'll get some more attention if you pretend to like video games just how you pretend to like anime whenever you're not getting railed by Chad.</br></br>  I picked this up recently.  <br>J-dramas are for general audience and shoujo is for teen girls and women with the mentality of a teen girl. K-dramas are closer to shoujo</br>  <br>玉木宏<br><br><br>I came here to let you know true about Japan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I thought all women love being masochist by picking the most ruthless guy. Then again I wonder, in most harem the MC would not pick the sweet childhood friend or the most passionate girls. Tsundere is still popular too.</br>  <br>Whatever you are talking about, turbo autistic landwhale.</br>  <br><br>The guy who wins isn't always the asshole bad boy, sometimes it's the "good" guy as well. Its honestly an even split imo.</br></br>  <br>I see please tell me something interesting.</br>  <br>Stumbled upon it recently too. Feels like a mix between Horimiya and Otomen, the latter of which I don't think anyone is translating. Fuck.</br>  <br>Stop trying to justify your shitty taste femslut.</br>  <br><br>Stop it, we are having a conversation here.</br></br>  <br>シコシコごっくん</br>  <br><br>I'm not justifying anything. I'm pointing out false ideas people have about shoujo.</br></br>  <br>The problem is most fangirls never admit the male lead is an asshole so the statistics are flawed. Hell, many fangirls actually believe that creep from Haou Airen is kind</br>  <br>Nobody cares femwhore.<br>Go get pumped in a club or whatever it is you usually do.</br></br>  <br>I guess so, but from the shoujo anime/manga I watched it tends to swing that way. Is it because women prefer big, strong badass guy, than sweet, care, kind guy?</br>  <br>That guy is shitting up all the thread, don't pay him any attention. <br><br>I'm sure it's this autist here </br></br></br>  <br>There are some shoujo mangas where the nice guy win but they're buried under tons and tons of generic shoujoshit. It doesn't help the international fandom only cares about the worse titles and derivative crap like Ao Haru Ride is what the Japanese audience want</br>  <br>probably (not same anon, just jumping to the convo.) It seems the "I want to make him better" mentality is everywhere not only in the occidental world</br>  <br><br>From my experience, they see it as a misunderstood guy with a good heart.<br><br><br><br>It honestly depends on who is introduced as the main love interest first if they both aren't introduced at the same time as love interest. I've read a fair share of shoujo that had the nice guy feeling unmanly because the bad boy was making moves.<br><br>Both are very popular in shoujo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I find tsunderes as extremely obnoxious but thanks to  sexism , the tsundere is a spoiled brat while the jerk has the power on the relationship and he often hurt the female lead. Tsundere violence is cartoonish violence while shoujo violence is realistic</br>  Just read this.<br><br>it might have been the best manga ive read in 5 years</br></br>  <br> sexism <br><br>back to tumblr</br></br></br>  <br> misunderstood guy with a good heart. <br>That sounds like Tsukasa Domouji, Hakuron and other wife beaters</br></br>  <br>name?</br>  <br>It's garbage.</br>  <br>I guess you have only read loli raping manga for 5 years.</br>  <br>anon, you are in a shoujo thread <br><br><br>I guess you should kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  ok, if you had to recommend me something out of the ordinary what would it be ppl?  <br>Crossboarding scum. You're the one polluting /a/</br>  <br>i have.<br><br>thats all japan has to offer, isnt it?</br></br></br>  <br> ppl <br><br><br> having all this shit taste </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, the most derivative of shoujo manga is average girl gets a hot guy regardless of his personality.<br><br>Maybe it's just my reading choices but the nice guys are equally present as well. <br><br>I've also noticed that IRL girls like generic bad boys as well. So there's that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>got a problem with my abbreviations? not like I care</br>  <br>But you do care reddit-kun, you even replied!</br>  <br>Nice try femwhore.<br>Get the fuck off my /a/.</br></br>  <br>Maybe I am just bored, senpai.</br>  <br> trying this hard to fit in with the boys <br><br>You'll always be a dirty femtrash whore who doesn't belong here, fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, essentially.<br><br>Tragic backstory + bad attitude + pure on the inside + sexually dominating + hot is what I think most of those characters adhere to.</br></br></br></br>   people keep falling for bait this hard <br>it's actually kind of hilarious</br>  <br>Shamefuru dispray! Tono!</br>  <br>Of course girls like bad boys. That's a fact, just like guys prefering models and movie stars over plain Janes. Haremshit and shoujoshit just give their audience what they want.</br>  <br>Are you implying we aren't all cute girls? <br>I swear, leddit ruins everything it touches these days.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, shoujo a shit. Even if it doesn't start as complete shit, the readers and the editors turn the manga into shit</br>  <br>You should watch j-drama if you actually like shojo manga at least. Reading shojo manga only makes me hard pain.</br>  <br/>  <br> just like guys prefering models and movie stars over plain Janes <br><br>Retarded guys, sure.</br></br></br>  <br>That's true. The audiences can tell tsundere is just being shy since they showing her blush constantly. While jerk guys are not showing or indicates that they care about the girl.</br>  <br>well to be honest,<br> its ok but most stuff from japan arent really litarary masterpieces.<br>so it might have been one of the better reads ive had in resent years atleast but only because it actually made me feel something.</br></br></br>  <br> guys prefering models and movie stars over plain Janes <br> femwhores are this detached from reality <br><br>Disgusting</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I was a femwhore. That's probably one of the few jobs where you could find all the time to watch as much anime as you want &amp; still earn enough to buy all the $$$ merchandise you want. If Japan wants to save the industry before its current customer base dies in its parents' bsement, it really needs to start pandering to prostitutes</br>  <br><br>I would like generic shoujo more if the drama wasn't so goofy half the time. Its very hard to take it seriously. <br><br>But I have taken a liking to reverse harems. All the boys are so great and you get a good variety so long as things don't get too dramatic.</br></br></br></br>   this turbo autist /r9k/ degenerate trying this hard   <br>Are you sure that's because they prefer looks on those model also ass and tits, rather than personality?</br>  <br>B-but he rapes her because he loves her so much.</br>  <br>reminder that consensual rape isn't aggressive and is kind of welcome</br>  <br>No shoujo/josei allowed on /a/.<br>No 3DPD whores allowed on /a/.</br></br>  <br>Female normalfags love K-on and Love Live so that's a start</br>  <br>  guys prefering models and movie stars <br>girls prefering athletes and movie stars<br>...would be the female equivalent to that<br><br>girls liking bad boys is more comparable to boys liking shy, sensitive, clumsy or genki girls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Might read this later. I always prefer tough, rough girl as protagonist in shoujo.</br>  <br>But anon, people are just having a conversation about a genre here, the actual sluts (like the ones that rejected you your entire life) are out there sucking countless dicks.</br>  <br>Obviously. Boys don't care about personality. Why do you think manchildren hate 3DPD and prefer waifus over real women? That's the most psychotic extreme</br>  I always heard shoujo was artless garbage that is basically "Oh he's so cold and abusive, but I can cure him with my love" type of shit. So I went to find the worst possible I could to see if shoujo really deserves the extreme shitflinging it gets.<br><br>So I read Akuma no Eros.<br>Dear lord.<br>This is bizarrely bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 3DPD whore mad as fuck cuz alphas on /a/ don't want her and prefer their waifus instead <br><br>3D PIGS BTFO</br></br></br>  <br>But i prefer girls that are composed and calm rather than bitchy, attention whore girls. That's why you fuck the bitches and marry the good girl.</br>  <br> Female normalfags love K-on and Love Live so that's a start <br>No normal fags love moe anime in the first place.</br></br>  <br>the people who prefer 2D to 3DPD prefer the personalities more than the looks.</br>  <br>I used to read Kimi ni Todoke. I stopped because it was going to kill me. Also I don't know how would I react if the faggots actually fucking kiss once but nooo can't show that in a christian shojo manga.</br>  <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br>you do realize that sexism (against men) means tsundere violence is treated as a joke, and not as physical/emotional abuse?<br> at the same time sexism in shoujo is telling women to just put up with whatever the fuck your boyfriend throws at you cuz it's true love </br></br>  <br> it's <br>What it?</br></br>    <br>Just caught up with pic related<br>It´s pretty good</br></br>  <br>preference</br>  <br>but anime also tells men to put up with female violence, by treating it as a joke that the mc never legitimately complains about.<br>in both cases it's fucked up, in one it's a joke, no real man would complain over it, in the other it's hot , that's what actually women want.</br></br>  <br>They said muslims were not bad guys... They said feminists were not bad guys... They said...</br>  <br>I am sure they are hard to make, but let's be honest. These gooks sure love to take the easy route and just copy paste anime cliches one after another. And the worst part about it, some people on /a/ fucking gobble that shit up like it's a sundae.</br>  <br>Holy shit no, please don't post this masterpiece here, it will get all shitted over.<br><br>What are you doing anon? Have you learnt nothing?</br></br></br>  <br> orange <br><br>NTR bullshit for sluts and literal cucks.<br>Get the fuck out with that garbage for whores.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>please go back to /r9k/</br></br>  <br>WOOOOOOW WTF?! DID HE ACTUALLY GROW SOME FUCKING BALLS?!<br><br>I bet it was dream or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Kimi ni Todoke is literally the most random, boring poorly written shoujo that I have ever read. <br><br>And I speak it of experience. It's garbage.</br></br></br>  <br> seppuku <br>what are those things? Poisonous cookies?</br></br>  <br>Nobody cares about your opinion whore, go ride Jamal's dick.<br>Fucking 3D pigs on my /a/.<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br> tsundere girls isn't a fetish <br> shoujo fans aren't laughing their asses off at all the fucked up things the boyfriend does to the heroine <br>honestly shoujo is more entertaining if you look at it as tongue-in-cheek. Anime is pretty much an eternal Van Halen concert</br></br></br>  <br> WOOOOOOW  <br> WTF?! <br> FUCKING BALLS <br> ?! <br><br><br> this is the kind of person who enjoy this Kimi ni Todoke garbage </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is the manga with the girl who gets bought by the grim reaper motherfucker and they slowly fall for eachother? And is it also like the one where the crippled grey haired bitch who is waaaaaaaay too wise for her age who falls in love with some goofy looking motherfucker and she turns out to be a magic link to fairies and shit? Cause I love both of them.  <br>but it is.<br>there are nice, composed, and humble women out there. but otaku don't want to bother finding them out of laziness. so they make excuses as to why these women are either ugly, imperfect, or promiscuous.</br></br>  <br> there are nice, composed, and humble women out there <br><br>Yeah, I'm sure that's you, fucking disgusting roastie cunt.<br>Flap your curtains and fly away bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are so wrong it hurts.</br>  <br>Yes,  Hana Kimi  was what got me into reading manga, and I've always come back to it for a new series eventually.  I can never actually bring myself to watch the anime, though, I always drop it no matter how much I loved the manga. </br>  <br>Of course at first, viewers would choose by looks. When their bad personalities shows at later episodes they would change their preference.</br>    <br>You are hurting his escapism.</br>  <br>Are those shoujo is what i was trying to ask...</br>  Some random anon posts a shoujo and everyone shits on him. So tell me /a/ what are some decent shoujo mangas?  <br><br>Anon, you're trying too hard. I'm sure that shoujo manga is upsetting your sensitive feelings and that shitting up the thread is a real riot, but you need to have more grace and subtlety in your words.</br></br>  Posting OTP  <br>Fucking blow me, whore.</br>  <br>wait, r9-kun, are we making fun of your favorite manga? Which todoke do you most want to kimi?</br>  I like shoujo sometimes. I dig how the girls look. Lipstick is so overlooked in anime, it's like nips forgot how sexy lips are.  <br> sonic </br>  <br>OTP indeed. <br> <br>I absolutely love this series you have no idea.</br></br></br>  Was that maid-sama manga shoujo cause I read all of it when it was still a running series.

I have seen a few other peoples thoughts on it, of which ranged from Bad to Average, reasons being bad character development and a very simple, episodic format.<br><br>Even after taking all this into consideration, I still really liked it, but I am not sure why. I think it has something to do with the main character. I could relate to her, probably because I have found myself in those same situations, as I also lacked social skills for a large portion of my school life<br><br>I want to hear other peoples opinion, and why, because despite what I have seen, there are a few people who really liked it, and are wanting another season.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chinese cartoon version of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'.
