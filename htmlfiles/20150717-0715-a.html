(laugh) <br><br>  Taniguchi: "It's not that." (laugh) "I like the fact that at the beginning she was a weakling, but due to Naruto's influence she steadily became strong." <br><br>  Kishimoto: "That's because Hinata doesn't stand at the main character's side like normal heroines*... she's the type that watches him from the shadows." <br><br>  Interviewer: "I thought the heroine was Sakura?" <br><br>  Kishimoto: "That's right. But Sakura is addicted to Sasuke." (laugh) "The reason why Hinata came to like Naruto is clear, but I've deliberately avoided writing down the reason why Sakura came to like Sasuke." (laugh) "That's because somehow, I had the feeling that it would conversely end up sounding contrived." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasusaku is the most popular het pairing on Japan so Kishi couldn't get away with not making Sakura the bio mom. I wouldn't be surprised if Kishi never intended to let Karin be the mom but he wanted to scare the sasusakus for generating intestest on Gaiden and it worked, considering even 2ch was afraid</br>  <br>hope an ausfag is doing it</br>  <br> Can't show why Sakura likes Sasuke without sounding contrived <br> They still get married and have a kid together <br>Sasusaku confirmed for editorial mandate</br></br></br>  <br>By virtue of the editor having been the one who made Kishi make them in the first place.<br>Kishi did make them marry and somehow procreate, but has no idea what the fuck could have led to that (besides rape, presumably).</br></br>  <br>I doubt that. It was most likely that Jump made him write ten extra chapters to promote the movie, he wanted to use the opportunity to draw his new Uchiha waifu but couldn't think of a plot, his assistant told him about the people asking if Karin was the mom of the kid that lives in Sakura's house just because of the glasses, so he wrote about that.</br>  ITT purest maiden of the season  <br>When bomber and alex show up, maybe two more episodes.</br>  <br>I think she's pretty fucking moe.</br>  <br>Someone should shop a TOP EBINA hat on Ebina.</br>  <br><br>Daily reminder that Ebina would suck your dick in exchange for a few burgers.</br></br>  <br>only if you agree to be her onii-san</br>  What does this MILF's face trying to convey?  <br>You need to be sexual to be a mom.</br>  <br>That is no excuse for such lewd bodies.</br>    <br>The fact that she's the end result of all those rape doujins if the victim gets away.</br>  tfw when the best girl never wins    <br>ALWAYS GETTING IN A GANG FIGHT<br>SHE IS THE ONE NAMED SAILOR COON</br></br>  I need to get on this train.
