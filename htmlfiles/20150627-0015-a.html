[ I just finished watching Monster today, and what a ride. The locations, characters, plot, music.. Everything was top notch. I just don't find the ending to be too satisfying though, I had hoped for something tragic. What are your thoughts on it, /a/nons?  Who were your favourite characters? Mine was Roberto.         ITT: underrated masterpieces.    Wolfgang GRIMMER   DOKKTA TENMAAA   I enjoyed it but that fucking ending... Literally stonewall the entire anime into being pointless.    I think you mean   The Magnificent Steiner      watching   Am I the only one who would have liked watching this in German?   OP here, how is the manga compared to the anime? Anything cut out in the animu?    I didn't mind the ending, although it was somewhat anti-climactic   It just built up for something big and then  some random drunk fuck shoots Johan, Tenma saves Johan and everyone lives happily ever after.     Yes?   Did they purposely not try with the character art in nagato-chan, so that they don't have to live up to the old haruhi series by kyoani?   if everyone just says "oh well, it's just a spin-off by a different studio, it's good for what it does" they get a free pass from fans like nintendo?     Does Nintendo even have fans anymore after the absolute shitshow that was the last E3?   The other day I realized it was the director's first show in that role.   It's like they WANT to fail. Maybe they're all secretly fans of KyoAni Haruhi and want to make it as shitty as possible so Kadokawa doesn't think of giving the actual S3 to some other studio again?     At least they still make video games and not just faggot multiplayer shit.    It's been years that being a nintendo fan was as good as being a big M.   The character art looks fine, autist.   The problem with the show is that it's so fucking boring and dull.      Do you love Nepgear?  Welcome to "Between Two Boobs" with Vert.    Yep. But not during the anime.     I love Buran.    Tonight's guest      She's the only nep for me.   Gear a shit  Plutia  is best nep.      Uzume gets confirmed for a spinoff before Plutia  Where is your goddess now?     Isn't Plutia horribly expensive due to HanaKana?      I wonder how much they're going to pay geoff just to appear in their show    A promo show similar to Iwata asks with Vert and 5pb? Good question.    7 days   7 volumes   Tonight, the forgotten fight on.

In related news, Jien Mei is confirmed to be voiced by KanaHana ruining my dreams of having HnM be voiced by her.  Also for some reason, they don't have a picture of her, just a silhouette with a coming soon.  This probably doesn't mean the crew is already having budget problems where they can't even post a damn drawing.        Right. Already did that. Now to where we left off.                          33 volumes   1 week  I got this shit.        I'd reccomend doing it in three days 1 to 12/13 12 to 24 24 to 33          Hm. I'll try. But why three parts?     To avoid burning yourself out as each one could serve as a climax for their respective third. Also, the anime is three cours.  I honestly just read it all in one go but that's just me.       Same here.         Not Hinowa.   Ushio will never understand how tsundere work.        It's poster material.          That fucking scene. You know that He didn't forget about him, yet it's still poweful.                        Ushio sure gets hit a lot by the women of this manga.                     This fucking LN. It feels pretty fun and good at first, but after volume 3, I feel like I was being scammed, betrayed, NTRed and... fuck, I'm just mad. To start off with the story premise.  It looks like a harem   It feels like a harem   It isn't one  For now at least, though I doubt it will change in the future. Fucking hell, the MC got a bunch of girls surround him and NONE of them can be said to hold actual romantic feeling for the MC. They just stand around him, being useless for the most part and tease the reader like: "Maybe there will be romance in the near future", "Look at all of these delicious girls who don't have any interest in the MC". This shit is just hardcore blue balled.  Then next, onto the 3 main girls. The goddess is an absolutely useless sack of shit in every aspect who has no redeeming point, the chuuni is also an useless sack of shit but to a lesser extent, the hardcore masochist knight is so good at the first 2 volumes it turned out to be a scam in volume 3 and she just make me feel NTRed while reading the first 2 chapters. She redeemed herself a little after that but I'm still mad.  2 other good girls that stay consistently good is that one Lich who's not in the party and the perfect goddess who has no screen-time (I doubt she will in the future)  And then we got the whole fiasco in volume 3 where it's essentially Shield Hero all over again with rotten aristocrat being rotten except that the MC didn't retaliate at all and just going along with all of these MISUNDERSTANDING and unjustly charges after a little bit of protesting. Which is a shame because he's a pretty good MC, a MC who's not a beta faggot at all, actually have interest in girls and sex, isn't dense, actually have common sense and an advocator of true gender equality but not to the degree of edgy.             MC didn't get a new body though.    No more like it shit on most reincarnation stories since MC is still weak as shit and has even more shittier life and more useless party.    Sounds like a parody to me.   Don't trust the japanese propaganda!They are all lies! Don't get married and have kids! If you see a truck jump at it and get transported to another world, they need you as the hero!!  Mushoku tensei new raw ch is out, Lucy POV.  Favorite Yuri?  Akari~n  TOSHINOU KYOUKO   I'm really glad they change studio    I cannot pick. I end up in circles when I try.   SEASON 3  WHEN H E N        Sakuradko    Why does Yui always looks like she's dead inside in the manga?    Very introspective?   Chinatsu, a.k.a. the only actual lesbian in the series.  Also Chitose, at least when she's not getting nosebleeds, because she's the sexiest.      the only actual lesbian in the series.   That might be why I hate her so much, other than her being a soulless bully.      Because the actual reason she ended up leaving alone was because her father molested her and the family wanted to sweep it under the rug. Out of sight, out of mind.   As a result she has some issues.      Ayano is pretty explicitly a lesbian as well.    Nah, it's never explicitly romantic with any other girls, that's the thing.   Only Chinatsu is a lesbian, or at least she's the only one explicitly self-aware that she's a lesbian. The other girls would be just as much at home in any random subtext manga.   Well, I guess there's Akari's sister too, but she's a joke character. And technically Nadeshiko and her mysterious girlfriend in the spin-off.        Did you somehow forget how she fawns over Kyoko in the majority of her screen time?    She just wants to be friends.  Nah, joking, but my point is still that the romantic aspect of that is just the SUBTEXT of their relationship, nothing more than you can find in dozens of random CGDCT manga that don't, you know, actually run in yuri magazines.  The severe lack of explicit lesbians is why I'm a bit annoyed YRYR was the one yuri anime that finally found an audience, since it pretty much doomed all the potential more serious future efforts.        I can't decide between these two.    I always thought of Kyoko as a lesbian. In Episode 12 (I think) when Chitose goes on that kissing spree after eating chocolate. when she approaches Kyoko, Kyoko has no problem with Chitose making out with her. In fact Kyoko invites her pretty much.     Have you considered the possibility that the severe lack of explicit lesbians is the main reason that YRYR was the one yuri anime that finally found an audience?     The sex between those two would be so awkward and cute.    It's about as subtext as assuming humans in the YRYR universe need to breathe air to survive. It's not explicitly stated but you'd have to be a moron not to see the obvious.    No, I'm reasonably sure it was the well executed slice of life and comedy aspects, no matter what /a/ tells you, Japanese otaku aren't actually THAT homophobic about their cute 2D girls.  We could've had a similar series only with girls that actually want to fuck and it would still do well.      Undoubtedly the best.          That's depressing.            Are you trying to make me sad?      I would molest her too. She is the best yuru      My favourite Yuri is Yuru   What the hell is this shit? Where is anti-bully ranger when you need her?        Dude there are tons of yuri manga that do both slice of life and comedy. You know why Yuru Yuri was the successful one? Because it wasn't too explicit. Try to convince yourself otherwise if you prefer, but that's the only factor separating it from the pack.                     Careful Yui, love hits like a truck.     Brace for impact     why does the show push Ayano x Kyouko so hard but the manga pushes Kyouko x Yui?     Too late.            Holy shit man         The writing is so stupid in this I can't help but laugh. And I can't handle anything depressing coming from this show.     I wanted this to end well, thats not going to happen anymore... right        Fin    I didn't ask for this.    なんてね！    Why would you be glad. Dogakobo did a very good job.           Actual fin. There's also a spinoff but it hasn't been translated yet.     Chinatsu isn't gay you fucking retard she just has a senpai crush on Yui.  Ayano on the other hand IS an actual lesbian. She's the only one who's actually self aware about being gay, to. Which you'd know if you'd pay attention to what the characters fucking say.    or at least she's the only one explicitly self-aware that she's a lesbian  That's Ayano, not Chinatus. Fucking moron.          It's a fucking comedy, calm your tits   What's the first thing that comes through your mind?   that one anime where the MC was in fifth grade but looked like a 20 year old dude.   Calling the FBI now.   Ghost cunny.    I think they're used too much. I mean, you don't need that prop to show they're e--ary students, that should be obvious from how they already look   Puffy vulvas   Quzilax    [x]Smooch loli tummy    Those look really uncomfortable.  Who the fuck makes a backpack out of non-breatheable material?  3DP VC         i'm thinking there's this one company that produces all the randosels in Japan, and they got some lobby/bribery scheme with all the schools to keep it that way.    How the hell every Japanese family can afford one? They're like five hundred dollars each.    They don't have to replace them and japanese families usually have 1 or 2 kids    Tradition   It's cheaper in Japan. Also it's strong. They can use it until they finish Elementary/Grade school.       These backpacks look so comfortable to wear.    rape   That thing is erotic as fuck, I would buy one if I had a little girl around here.   Raep.    Why is that backpack 3dpd?   This is pretty likely.       This. My first thought was. Expensive Bags.      It's cheaper in Japan   No: http://ranking.rakuten.co.jp/daily/<wbr>301055/</wbr>       Oh, it's backpack sized. I thought it was a belt-pouch or something.  This thread makes more sense now.      Holy shit, no wonder nips don't want to reproduce. That's insanely expensive.    loli porn    We had ransel back in elementary school, but they were all brown and wider.  Fuck ussr female school uniform, it sucked.     Please translate I cannot read moonrunes. I can see a varying prices ranging from 1000+ yen to 54000+ yen. Tell me that the 54000 are the posh ones while the 1000 ones are the common plebian bags.     nice blog, post pics    Symphogeah is so popular yet its subs are never consistent. Truly suffering.  Remember that bullshit with commie not subbing the final episode until month+ later   A little boy wearing nothing but white socks and ransel, waiting on a desk  Excitement!!   It's high quality backpack and can last through your entire grade school session(which is like 6 years), I wouldn't say it's expensive at all.    The question now is "how strong is it?"  I imagine that unless you got run over by a Japanese truck, that bag should last forever.      The word 'randosel'.  Does anyone else actually visualize the spelling of the word first, or do they jump straight to associated images?     St. Margareta.   Yep. Made out of 200 components fabricated using Japanese technology. I've watched some parts of a show about how it's made (The Mark of Beauty on NHK World) and it shows how autistic Japan goes when it comes to aesthetics and detail.   Honestly, I started thinking about how nice it would be if I could have someone like Lili from DanMachi in Diablo 3.   And then I thought a little bit about how that role wouldn't work for a character in an MMO because no way in hell would anyone let someone else pick up all the loot. It just makes no sense in game design but it does make a bit of sense in the context of the story.  Sorry, I gave more than the first thing.      I am going to jail and it's going to fucking suck and not even be mildly pleasant   I didn't even know the word. And also, no.     Very Loli.   I keep hearing that it's sturdy and will last until the kid is in middle school (when they stop using them), but even the cheap ones seem to be around 220 USD. For six years, that's around 36 a year, that's way more than replacing the backpack when needed  Am I just dumb or are these that much cheaper in Japan?    Worst fucking prop. I want my rape victims to be intelligent enough to fully process what's happening to them. Elementary schoolers don't cut it.    that one anime where the MC was in fifth grade but looked like a 20 year old dude   Cardcaptor Sakura?      Apples.      You did not just talk about Sakura like that.    Pretty sure it's Yoiko Funny anime. Like SYD but good     Tiny, undersized backpacks.    Recorder to Randoseru     Amatuers     I'd stick it in her fanny pack.    swimsuits and thigh-highs    Cash.    Looks like a mailbox    You can get a $40 Jansport backpack that lasts 6 years. This sounds more like a way to show off to the other parents.    its even in the name    kawaii as fuck http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ui_a<wbr>7ahBaDU</wbr>  [ ]    Why do my kids keep leaving their backpacks in my room?    That I want one, solely for the fact that they're so commonly used and so expensive. They must be really amazing somehow. But I won't get one because I'm not a little kid and don't like using backpacks.      "I wonder if Jlist still sells those"is my thought.    This photo of Aoi with a red backpack that resembles a randoseru.   This      Kyon-kun Denwa       That's been made impossible by the number of adults who look and sound like e--ary students running around. We need extra confirmation.     e--ary  What is e--ary?     小○生   <br/>    uncut  My sides      hop on faggot, we're going to the playground     Would I get bullied if I went to school with an Eastpak as a loli in Japan ?       using durable gear  It's like you don't even want to shopping with your loli friends!     Here, take this: 〇    You can get them for a lot cheaper than that. I can look up school uniforms, etc. as sold to Americans online and the prices would be a lot higher than what people actually spend.   Now factor in this: most Japanese schoolkids don't drive cars. In America it is common for highschool shits to have a car. Also factor in the difference in annual food costs between western kids and Japanese kids. They spent thousands of dollars more on junk food for the family than the average Japanese family spends.   http://ランドセル人気.jp.net/kakaku.html 5th most popular is in the $160~$200 bracket. Now how much is a laptop? A cheap car? Brand clothing? An average school backpack will be used for average about a year, and will run between $25~$100 bucks. Compared to the randoseru which lasts for around six years of daily usage western backpacks are starting to look even more expensive. The randoseru is also given to kids as a special thing for entering school and not treated like an everyday throw away object.    Instead of making kotaku grade out of context comparisons be a little honest next time.           Cute girls that needs protecting.   I hope to one day save up my cum in bottles and then get one of those bags. I'll wataproof the inside of it, and empty the contents of my multiple bottles into it. Then I'll try to walk around town with a vibrating bullet in my trying as hard to not to spill my cum filled bag.      But that's a zero.   Little girls   Wow, the're pricey on eBay..$150 is for the genuine line. If I had a kid I will buy one for her... yes her.     〇 zero ○ maru ◯ big maru      Are they allowed to use other type of school bag? Or the school regulationim impose them to use randoseru?  生意気な子供は早々にランドセル使わなくなるんだよね     Todcon    The TV series even comes with a red backpack DVD case.    You're going to call the FBI because of a picture of backpacks?    Fun Fact: Japanese school backpacks are actually based on Japanese Army backpacks back in WW2. In a funny way, could be a symbol of "indoctrination or nationalism" if you want to call it that.    They are comfy indeed   I got mine for 4000jpy (+shipping and proxy)  I'm a girl and I'm fairly small so I can get away with wearing it; people don't know it's an elementary school bag unless I let them know        nyanpasu    In a funny way, could be a symbol of "indoctrination or nationalism"  You mean like how they also adopted western attire as worn by the British and Dutch?   In a funny way, it could be said you are a fucking idiot.       randosero  Because that's what it is. Closely followed by "lolis".      muh fucking nigga. came here to post this    I think I'll buy one too, they look very cute.  Thanks for the information.      4000 yen  How much is this in €?     Kaerimichi    Well drawn floor    http://lmgtfy.com/?q=4000jpy+to+eur<wbr>o</wbr>   For a second I thought it was a cut slab of meat from the thumbnails.  Now I'm disappointed.     where i come from, these bags are consider small as shit for an elementary schooler by small i meant that it doesnt enough space for books I swear kids these days fill their bags with garbage      i have a $20 that last all through middle and highschool and college (i still have it).  you just need to look at the stitching to know if it's good.       well, it's not like they are going on a cross-country hike with it  when it comes to designing school backpacks for small children, I assume the priorities are ergonomics/skeletal health and durability  it's easier to achieve correct weight distribution using a semi-rigid material, that's why camping/hiking backpacks have solid backs  and when it comes to durability... man, I went through so many backpacks when I was a kid, they just kept ripping and tearing  kids can be very destructive              fill their bags with garbage   I went to elementary school in the 90s and it wasn't uncommon to take home 2-5 full size text books on top of library books, writing supplies, binders with writing paper, and a lunch box. Put my bag on a scale a few times when it felt heavy and it was over 30 lbs. I think nippon has teachers with the brainpower to operate a copying machine so their kids don't have to deal with that shit.      My dad's old lunchbox.    Japanese kids keep a lot of their supplies in their desk. That's why they have assigned seating.   They bring home only what they need to do homework. Which is usually just their books + the papers for the assignment.       femlet     Now that's class.     It's high quality backpack and can last through your entire grade school session(which is like 6 years), I wouldn't say it's expensive at all.   I've got a ratty old backpack which is still adequately functional and been with me for over 10 years now - it cost between £20-30 back then.         What's the first thing that comes through your mind?  That's some nice leatherwork. That's all.      Just in-case no one noticed that the middle school uniforms are literally navy attire?    Thats a soft looking ass    shit man, are those even real leather? i cant find another explanation     The time when my mom bought that and tried to force me to wear it when I was in grade 5.    The girls are navy, boys are army.    that is a cheap as fuck version. only betafaggots would buy that shit.     It is against the law to have sex with elementary school girls.  (the arrows say 5th, for 5th grade)     Creatures like that exist     It's time to fap again.    My mind is blown wtf     that look in her eyes      THIS    What you people dont get is that Randoseru are expensive because they are made out of extremely durable material.   They are meant to be used from elementary school into middle school and then given to younger siblings, and those younger siblings going through elementary school and middles school. These are sort-of generational backpacks, and when given the choice between buying a new backpack every couple years for your kid and then buying NEW backpacks again for the younger sibling because she doesnt want to wear her older sibling's bag is costly in the long run, more-so than if you spent the money for a decent randoseru.  What makes randoseru better than normal backpacks is the shape, they are specifically designed for school. They are not limp, so books do not flop about when you run, they are tightly sealed so books do not fall out, there are no excessive straps, no needless space. They are meant for holding school supplies are they do a much better job of it than any normal backpack.  Randoseru for cosplay and fetishism go for much cheaper, like 4000 yen, but those are of lesser quality.    buh buh japanese schools r slavery!!   muh muh free expression to waste money on backpacks   m-muh freedoms.  no. fuck off. Randoseru are great. If you dont think theyre great you have something wrong with your brain.  Randoseru can be vastly customized with keychains, straps, embossed designs, etc. Some schools even allow some variation from the color scheme, some schools with a Red for girls and Blue for boys might allow girls to have pink or cherry and might allow for boys to have dark black if they desired. Not to mention traffic reflectors etc               I got mine too (but the shinier version) for not much more than that. I get complimented every time I wear it. Normies love them. One woman asked me wear I got it and it was the most awkward experience ever, I saw the life drain from her eyes as I told her to search 'randoseru'. Won't ever make that mistake again. Makes me kek in hindsight.      This automatically puts me in a fapping mindset why?       they are specifically designed for school.   That's pretty neat, though elementary school is where you use the least amount of books.      That flower pattern gave me a bright idea. What if we were to equip the other side with ventilators on the inside? Our lolis will never have sweaty backs again!      though elementary school is where you use the least amount of books.  You'd be surprised. They get more workbooks and things as they go on. This is over a six year period, we're talking. They may not have many books at first but later on they do.  Also i forgot to mention its traditional for the grandparents to pay for the Randoseru. So most of the time the parents arent even the ones to pay for the bags.  Also some schools have randoseru for children who cant afford them.        Really Acrobatic Prepubescent Elementary Schools      I like my lolis sweaty, fuck off.    We can add a power button.   My future niece running home and gives me a big hug, followed by me cooking her dinner and us just watching TV until she falls asleep..  This thread makes me want to commit a crime.   Add a heating system, it will make them get lots of hugs during winter.    Is the manga better?    Kind of like asking whether college students can wear anything but Northface jacket.    Holy shit you sound like such a weeb.   muh superior japanese bag system!       loli.     folded over 1000 times n shit.     What a fantastic idea. I think we have a great group of intellectuals here.      Elementary Schools   Schools      should read schoolers  don't blame me I'm only 8 years old       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ESV<wbr>OF6DScKQ</wbr>  [ ]      Holy shit you sound like such a weeb   No, just educated.  I dont learn everything about japan from biased kotaku articles. Instead of being fucking ignorant about japan I chose to learn something.       Pretty sure it's not translated    1.Cambridge Satchel Co. 2. Ren-chon     I'll give them one thing, having a standard forces teachers to work with the standard size instead of just assigning whatever books they please and expecting kids to deal with it.      Posts like these are why I can never leave /a/.        Cute little girls.    the loli thread is here     Thanks!  But I already had that thread open.      why does she have a poop on the pillow next to her     Those are some fine ass backpacks. I think I can understand Japan's obsession with them now.      Japanese   Younger siblings  Pick one      that's one ugly backpack.    Quzilax.    Dancing Bunny's Crimpt Edges is way underrated.   Grade schoolers.  How delicious they are is the second thing that comes to mind.     Ragnarok Online. Blacksmiths have a skill specifically for picking up all the loot in a certain radius, as well as the preceding Merchant skills for selling common items to NPCs at higher price,setting up player shops with uncommon items, and carrying more shit in general. This is doubly important because 1) high levels require a ton of AOE grinding that leaves more loot on the ground than can be efficiently picked up individually, and 2) forge builds require a stat distribution that renders the blacksmith extremely weak in actual combat. The risk of stolen loot is mitigated by the fact that anybody who steals anything of real value is going to have their name ruined and never find another guild.      I read a hentai manga years ago where elementary school girls had to go home with pictures of their vaginas displayed on their backpacks, and their arms handcuffed to the backpacks so that they can't take them off. They were allowed to take off the packs when they got home because their parents have the keys. That's what I think about every time I see those bags. If anyone knows the name of the manga I'm talking about let me know.      Pedophilia    Why do they use pictures of white girls to advertise them?    Exotic   Fancy old-timey shoes.    not creating a troll stalker to steal loot on chase walk  Check out this faggot.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188897  This... this makes me want to do a crime   These backpacks are so expensive...    boys to have dark black   dark black   So Darker than Black?

I was a normal guy just a couple o seconds ago.    It depends on what features/model you want. Suffice to say the deluxe edition isn't worth just the price of a van and some candy     Non non biyori PV    Or To Aru manga with Awaki and shota.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188897  What I can't believe is how short those skirts are, in my country this would never happen.    My exact thoughts, if your kids go outside like that you failed as a parent, at least maybe the parents don't know, they go outside of house all well dressed as good girls and change on a friends house like that, either way their parents fail.    Black shirt and pink skirt? Kinda reminds me of something.   I am tempted to do a statutory crime on these girls.    only statutory.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188897  The eye censor just makes it all the more illicit-looking      That is a promotional pic, not real kids outfits. Don't get ahead of yourselves.      The new Doraemon series, looks very entertaining.   Basa Basa Tsubasa  itty bitty loli titty   Artist? Looks really familiar, but I can't even check because Pururin is so fucking slow    Those thighs and butt cheeks    Fucking robot lolis and their perfectly crafted buttcheeks.      Once mass produced lolibots become a reality there will be a man whose job title will officially be lolibutt inspector.       Quzilax   the hell happened to that guy?  no new manga since 2013!

Just how extremely perverted I have become over the years.  In just 4 years I went from hating anime and being a /tg/ hardliner to being the most degenerate person I know, actively translating doujinshi that would socially castrate me in the Bible Belt.  I am personally OK with it, but when my family still jokes about whether or not I have seen porn, I feel like I have to keep up a persona of nerdy innocence.  /blogshit           30+ browsing /a/ past midnight; are you a wizard onii-chan?     assuming everyone is an amerifat     It's almost noon and I'm at work.    Its not a bad assumption. The majority of 4chan's traffic is from the states.    Fucking how? Wanyanaguda's art is terrible.     I've eyeballing one of these on amiami lately. Is it ok for a full grown man to want one of these?    Anal sex.    What?     I am personally OK with it, but when my family still jokes about whether or not I have seen porn, I feel like I have to keep up a persona of nerdy innocence.  iktfb     Did you start anime as underage b&amp; or were you older?       Saw some fag wearing one back in university. I hated him.      Is she taking them off or putting them on?         Do you cum on your mailbox?      You make me want to commit a crime anon.

Why don't you just leave it do its own thing. Eat some fucking plants, shit a lot. What the fuck man.    Is that Serena Williams?   To sell the tusks.    this one is just sad     Why would you ever kill an elephant.  sometimes they get to close to villages and destroy their crops or its for their ivory     gotta gi me som ivory mayne.   Ittekimaaasu!  K-kaa-san, Yamete kudasai.      That's depressing.  Fuck       this was the saddest shit ever in this movie    what the fuck's wrong with it?    Chinks will pay out the ass for magic dick tusk magic pills.  And y'know, elephants do have a nasty habit of stomping on farmland and eating villagers crops.      yes  no      food and safety bull elephants regularly kill people and destroy crops     j-just run pleeease    fuck you    never gets old    This. Chinks pay a fucking huge amount of money for this shit. Same goes for turtles from Madagascar.    Lion cub broke its back while hunting with its mom. Lioness left it to die.    I'm Crimean rivers here.    Somehow I didn't find it as bad as that sloth program they advertised with "babies getting pajamas! So cute!"  The weaker baby dies and then the second one refuses to eat or move and dies. Sloths just fucking give up. Like there's a video on youtube of a cougar chasing a sloth and the sloth just closes its eyes in pain and lets go.  Predators have so much more fun than sitting in a tree until an eagle eats you, even lion cub played for a while.   !!!   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=90M<wbr>7kH5wCtA</wbr>  [ ]  damn        Jesus Christ. I couldn't imagine being the photographer just watching that shit unfold and not doing anything about it.    Why'd they have to name the sloth? Why?    SARABA DA!

I'm waiting for a new photo book to come out but it's crowdfunded so it'll take til next year.    those little pink nib tails sticking out over their pantsu line         rulesofnature.mp3     What would you do, Unless you bring it to the zoo of NY it was going to die eventually.    Pretty sure all photographers encounter that feel at some point.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188401  is that some mondo?    there will never be a nature documentary turned into over the top anime form   S-Sonna....  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188401   repeatedly stabbing it when it's already down  Why do niggers ruin everything?     You don't take chances with hippos.    If you're hunting, don't you want to make sure it's dead? I hate this stupid "don't hurt animals!" mentality where everybody assumes they're just killing because they can.     not FROG GUNDAMU, IKIMASU!     Hippos kill the most out of any animal and you DON'T want to be near it if it's angry.     dat sloth qt       Hamtaro gone wild  and wrong .   Ehhhhhh?!

Based Hippos    This, hippos are scary    Hippos are  big  animals    It's not like the hippos are killing anything that matters.      yes goyim. It is the dumb brown peoples who are your real enemy!       elephants regularly kill people  [citation needed]   I think you're mistaking elephants for hippos.       You saying humans don't matter? How pro-hippo can you be?       Where were humans mentioned? I thought we were talking about Africans?      black screen, oh oh I dont want to play that webm    There's baby goats and dolphin, trust me.      African nigger reporting in.  Hippos need overkill.  They WILL fight to the very end.  They're insanely tough creatures, even on the brink of death.  You know how white people call brave people "lions"?  Well in much of Africa, brave people were called "Hippos"               That one of the dog chasing the deer   That's all swell and nice, but giving a teeny bit of a distorted view of reality. 99.999999% of the time things don't work out like that. For every 1 dog and monkey pair of buddies, there's 5,000,000,000 wildebeest that are eviscerated and literally eaten alive by hyena.        That's how our ancestors hunted long long ago too.        How fucking tough are they?      I man up and did it, thanks anon    Stop being such a fucking killjoy faggot.    die three hours later in the woods tough    Don't think about it      Lion cub broke its back while hunting with its mom. Lioness left it to die.     MOSHI-MOSH~   Elephants can cry?    did the people rescue it?   OYASUMI   Of course not. Wildlife photographers are liberal assholes who would rather watch animals die on film than help them.   Mitte, mitte!   For you   ITADAKIMASU!  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190321  omg is it okay??    Rule number one in to not interfere with nature. How they live their lives has worked well for millions of years and as tragic as it may be that lion cub in death will give life back to something else.   Human factory farming is a million times crueler than that but do you think twice about chicken or beef products?     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190321  disgusting   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190321   daijobu?    I really hate this obsession over 'saving' animals and treating them with rights, oftentimes treating them better than your fellow humans. Interfering with nature is the worst thing you can do.  Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones.       It'd be more liberal to intervene you dumbshit     fucking why what the fuck is this obvious the bizon wanted to get away couldn't he get out the fucking way jesus man herbivores are fucking retarded        All that movement open the wound so wide its entire insides spilled out. Daijōbude wa arimasen   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190321   tries to bite off its own guts   that's some apostle shit there.      So how much money does random wild animal B deserve to keep it alive instead of being random wild animal T's lunch? Small things in reserves work, but treating something serious that will pull the animal out of any social contact for weeks or months will fuck it over indefinitely unless you pump even more money into reconditioning areas. A guy who's good with a camera isn't the person to rely on for those facilities.    instead of ramming the other bison it could've also just barreled through the wolf pack. "I'm not d-doing this because I like you or anything, b-baka." would be a possibility, yet theat cunt goes all "Keikaku Doori" on it's ass.

What the fuck    Whoops, didn't mean to quote.     Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones  And there's this weeb.     Ok so how would you deal with the lion cub?     Congratulations your a libtard fuck living in the south?  What more do you want to know?       I-ikuuu~    Whoops, looks like someone spilled their yogurt on a bird!     Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones.  shut he fuck up please.  wow this thread is full of all kinds of ignorant stage 4 cancer        Liberal has meant "anything I personally disagree with" for years.     it probably doesn't recognize what his intestines are. he just felt pain in that area and tried to pull of what he must've thought was causing it.

CHOTTO MATTE KUDASAI!     implying conservatism is RULES OF NATURE   implying some of the greatest conversationalists and wildlife enthusiasts weren't conservatives      M-Masaka...

The fuck?      African elephants are aggressive and extremely territorial. You're thinking of indian elephants.

NYANTO??     Don't be fucking stupid, a virus couldn't post in a thread unless it managed to mind-control a human, and we haven't evolved that far yet.      Viruses    Controlling human minds  ha ha ha What a funny joke hahahaha        everytime   A demoralised Kumiko is fine too.  How are people supposed to see anime as art when KyoAni keeps making stuff like this?  I love Gotou.   That crushing feeling when you can't get good, no matter how hard you try.    Have you been working on those lip slurs anon?   SO UGLY.   EVEN Hazuki and Natsuki was amazed at how shit Kumiko was playing, and they didn't even make the cut.   Why don't they just fuck already?   Maybe they don't know how.   I just can't take this character seriously. I want to laugh whenever I see her dumb face on the screen. She's just so adorably autistic.     2special4u?   shh, Kumiko is sleeping   I want to put her in a room filled with LEGO bricks and watch her play with them all day long.    Because in Japan girls are gay in High School up until they find the D that they want then they endlessly pursue that D. If they fail they're doomed to Christmas Cake status.  Girls aren't allowed to switch D pursuit unless the new D is above and beyond all expectations in the ultimate shape of masculinity.  You now understand why Harems are such fierce competitions.        Why must you respond to shitposters?     girls only allowed to change Ds if new D is greater   thus harems are competitive  Surely it can't be that hard to find something superior to the faggots who typically find themselves leading harems?       Robert fripp did it, you can do it too.    I want to drink her blood.   You would think that, however density also starts with D and dense D also sounds like density which means the harem lead is the ultimate D.  Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.      What are you talking about, anon? Just look at her.    I want to fuck her sister.   Like pie in the sky    I want to fuck all the Hibikes at the same time.  How would socially awkward attempt to court Taki?   peace-chan has a name    I sort of miss those days. Things were so much simpler then.     That's basically the main reason why I want season 2. I want to see her try to act flirty around him.     Invite him on a quick trumpet walk up Mt. Fuji  iykwim .    She should go after him with a bottle of water offering it to him because it's hot. Taki thanks her and Reina dies.    I-I don't anon.   I don't know. I think she would just try to talk to him a little while and then tell him that she loves him if he's enjoying the conversation or smiles.  That or  she would mount him and demand that she start touching him, even though she would probably grab one of his hands and put it on her breast.           The same way how Kumiko approached Taki-sensei this episode. Leave her cellphone intentionally, they go to the room where she left it and then she rapes him there.      H-here, drink this sensei   Oh? You're giving me water?   It's because you look h-hot.  She then leaves blushing furiously and amazed at herself for being so bold.       So that's why Reina wanted Kumiko to tell her what happened.  Sasuga Reina.     Do you think Reina runs a blog or since she's so super special and different from all the other girls her age she has a traditional, physical diary where she writes about her interactions with Taki-Sensei?     I did it Kumiko, I told Taki I thought he looked hot      She would drug his drink, wait for it to kick in and rape him. A few months layer Reina sends him a positive pregnancy test result and attached to it is picture of her grinding his dick.     Reina shitposts about her crush on /r9k/    get on my level bitch.      Reina?  More like REEEEEEEEEEEEina, amirite fellas?      Reina is a pussy that pretends to be hardcore around other people. She would probably faint if Taki-Sensei even touched her.      She's also an M, I don't see her raping anyone.    She's M and S.  She reminds me of me.      Holly fuck a 'proper' nosebleed sacre bleu!     Kousaka-san, you'll be playing the solo. Not Nakaseko-san. You'll play. Got it?   Y-YOU TOO!      She's probably only an M because she found Taki's laptop open one day, and learned, among other things, that Taki hasn't mastered private browsing.      Now its time to disscuss medecine.what was the cause of Kumiko's nosebleed? Stress? Dry air? Obscure disease?       What does Taki does on his computer? Jacking off to professional orchestra music?     He watches that one amateur porn video he made with his wife over and over again. Then cries at the end.     It was not dry air. Kyoto is like the fucking Amazon in summer.    We went over this. The only causes for nosebleeds in anime are punches to the face or indecent thoughts. And I'm pretty sure Kumiko wasn't punched off-screen.      Implying they had time to do that  Taki married and his wife died like the week after what a fucking loser      Dehydration      10 orchestra hacks that will change your life   What this 10 year old trumpet prodigy does next will blow your mind   Depression help       Yuuko plz   Well whadda you know.  Screens are up, fuckers.     It's Key AIDS. Kumiko will be hospitalized right before the competition and Reina will completely fuck up her solo because she's worried about Kumiko. Reina will become a pariah, reviled by the band while looked on by Taki with only a gaze of deep disappointment while Kumiko becomes sicker and sicker. Kumiko will eventually die and Reina will try to throw herself off the school roof before being stopped by  Shuichi  who will  confess his love to her.    why the fuck did I write this       This shits going around.    Like seriously.    Holy shit the ponytail is back.    Ponytails everywhere.    Ponytail is back. Nice.    3 ADs  It's over KyoAni is finished.    JUSTICE    Kumiko must be sweating in that uniform she hates summer after all.      ponytails are back      last episode not called "Hibike! Euphonium"  I'm ready for you, second season.    Didn't Tamako's last episode have even more ADs?   Leave it to Kyoani to have us waiting until the end. The promo image didn't lie, Kumiko has the hairband around her wrist.   Nope, only one.    BUCHOU!    Look at her fucking uniform!  these illustrations will most likely become drama cds, as it happened with free!      Are the winter uniforms their performance uniforms? Only the slackers seem to be wearing their summer get up.       Ponytails vs. Ribbons: which is better?        !       Is it not possible that this scene is before or after their performance?    I think its for the more formal look.  コンクールの舞台で演奏できる時間は“たった”12分間。 それは一瞬のようで、でも永遠のようで……。 吹奏楽部員たちはその12分のために青春のすべてをかけて練習してきた。 北宇治高校吹奏楽部の演奏が始まる。         I'm pretty sure there have been some relatively recent KyoAni episodes with a couple of ADs, I just can't remember which shows did it. Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  It's pretty funny just how little staff is required per episode in KyoAni shows compared to other productions.     Are they really going to focus on music?  Hold old is Taki anyway?   Dehydration, which is why she was given water.    Ponytail is back, fick ja!          Taki in formal attire  How wet will Reina be?     Taki is 34. You should know this by now, Anonymous.     return of the ponytail   return of the winter uniform  It's the obligatory fan service episode.      There have been rare eps with two ADs but three is quite unusual for Kyoani.    I'll ask my friend. I'm pretty sure he can see the future.    Wiki says 34, although it varied from 32-34 before. I'd like novelanons to confirm ;-;    Brilliant.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEl<wbr>5RvbGdik</wbr>  [ ]       Asuka ponytail  I still have mixed feelings about her but now I'm definitely aroused.      the description of the scene is that they fell asleep during practice. And the entire page is dedicated to the duet episode. It's probably one of those "it happened but we didn't show it" artworks. Kumiko has the hairband because she always puts up her hair for concerts, and they were practicing in the concert hall.       Well, it is the closing of three consecutive productions for KyoAni. With this many ADs on board here's hoping for a really well-animated performance. It would be great to have back-to-back episodes with cool animation highlights.     1434178590484.jpg  I really love the uniform designs in this show. The color palettes are very cute. I also like the little number in the back. Nice touch.     Who is she again?    Episode 13 "Goodbye, Competition" The amount of time to play in the concert is just twelve minutes. It seems like it will be over in an instant, but it seems like it will last an eternity... For the sake of those twelve minutes, the concert band members have stakes the springtime of their youth. Kitauji High School Concert Band's performance begins now.       I-I fucking love taki.    We know Riko, we know.    None of that says it can't be an actual scene. Do you not want it to be an actual scene?   Who are the staff for the last episode?   Reina please contain yourself    Go back to your trumpet solo.     Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  3 animators teams. 1 from Do, 2 from KyoAni. They might reach 20 KAs this time.  Too bad, their best animators already worked on episode 10-12 so they probably won't be in the finale.          start the show with ponytails   end the show with ponytails   There must be some deep symbolism in this, I can't figure it out though.       Who are KyoAni's best animators these days? Is Kigami still relevant as a key animator?    they had like 9 KA on the last episode, do they even need 20?   There's lots of instruments and tiny details this episode.   They sure do if they're going all-out on depicting the performance.    of course he's still relevant, he did episodes 5 and 11    But no tiny hats.     Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.   I chuckled a bit, but it's true best boys can be found in the sausagefest that are baseball mangas.      5 and 12*    Direction: Kawanami  SB: Yamada AD: Sezaki, Akitake, Hikiyama      Huh, no Ishidate. He's normally the finale guy.    Their best or most experienced that aren't AD or ED - Tatsuya Satou - Shinpei Sawa - Hiroshi Karata - Kunihiro Hane - Yoshinori Urata - Mariko Takahashi - Kouhei Nakahara Kigami actually worked solely on key animation for like a year before Hibike.            Do we know which staff members haven't been very active lately? IIRC Ogawa and Utsumi have been pretty quiet so maybe they are doing some new project.     normally  Outside of his own show and Chuu2? Not really.     he's 34, although I forgot where they mention his age     although I forgot where they mention his age  Pretty much when he first appears.     there's no way Utsumi isn't doing animation for the Free movie. She's just directing anything for it.    just not*   Even Natsuki was embarrassed.   Holy shit, Kumiko sucked.    BD/DVD vol.2&amp;vol.3 also added event ticket.  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/650<wbr>45</wbr>     Its over. KyoAni on bankruptcy watch.      3 event tickets  We jew now     She's not in a position to judge.  She didn't even make the audition.       I think the both of you may be misinterpreting that scene.     I hope she's working under Takemoto's supervision. Her talent shines through the most when she's led by someone else. Same with Ishidate.    more like time to announce a s2    Do they have enough event tickets?    better add more tickets just in case    tfw Aoi won't be at the concert   Yes. That position, yes.    ■感謝イベント　京都でお祭りフェスティバル ～南座へようこそ～ 概要    日程：2015年10月31日(土)   時間：17:00開場／17:30開演   会場：京都四條 南座 (京都市東山区四条大橋東詰)   The same day as KyoAniDo event. It's in Kyoto too.            tfw I don't give two fucks about a random non-character with a subpar design      same day as KyoAniDo event  Isn't that counterproductive?    live action  Is the next episode the last?   There's an OVA in December.     Beach episode confirmed     Too many guys    So we don't end with them playing in the competition?    What? Sauce?    7 volumes, 2 episodes each. That means episode 13 + OVA is in the last volume.    http://anime-eupho.com/product/  続巻発売日情報   第4巻：2015年9月16日（水）  第5巻：2015年10月21日（水）  第6巻：2015年11月18日（水）  第7巻：2015年12月16日（水）  Volume 7 of BDs goes on sale on December 16th. Every BD volume contains two episodes and a short special. Anime TV series only has 13 episodes.  It's the same thing that happened with Amagi Brilliant Park. TV series had 13 episodes, OVA came out with the seventh BD volume.                They announce S2 on Tuesday, right?  I want to fuck Kumiko, hard.   Taki tapped that right?    KyoAni has been consistently doing this format for their TV shows since Chuu2Ren.       Asuka stoic as fuck whilst everyone else is has varying degrees of damn when Kumiko got told.   Now that I think about it, they didn't focus on Shuu's reaction, did they.    Right, because she can't feel empathy.      That reminds me of Haruhi.    god, are japanese ugly without photoshop and centimeters of make up  Centuries of imbreeding do that to you. Almost as bad as English.       That little river play was cute, a push for each other to get good.   Get good, Kumiko.    Must be a communist.        <br/>    Asuka reads it for the first time and plays it flawlessly. Kumiko, who has been playing euphonium for seven years, struggles even after practicing for an entire week.       If you look at the music for the piece she played for her middle school competition, it's not that hard in comparison. The degree of difficulty is just this much higher than what she's used to.  Asuka's just special.    Will Shoe1 win the Kumikobowl?     Maybe on the new AniDO project? They have something to announce next month.     Why do most japanese in highschool look ugly? Is it because of inbreeding?     If they make two more seasons, or a two cour second season, then yes. If they end it with this season, nope. It's an adaptation of a novel, and in the novel he only wins the k-bowl at the end of the third volume.      He's already out of the running.    He's the only one in the running. It might take him a year but he'll get to the finish line eventually.      He's the only one in the running.  That's what you think.     Piss off Kumiko     tfw you will never go to a Hibike event     WAKE UP BITCH    Please don't suck so much donkey dick and PUT THE FUCKING BLANKETS.    Would be weird if AniDo announced the new show and not Kyoani. Even Free's announcement was all under Kyoani's name.     Not Kigami Not Ishidate  3 ADs....  I can't say they're cutting corners but I'm kinda disappointed.             Violin-chan is a cutie.      Is Aoi daijobu?  I hope she gets into a uni and STEM subject of her choice.     I never understood the obsession to study for college during your final high school year.    That's the feeling that indicates that you're not trying hard enough.    Entrance exams. You can't go to college if you don't pass them.    Are entrance exams in japan really that hard? To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd.   Why isn't Reina in any special classes? Is that normal in Japan? Here in America, autistic children have their owns classes. And when they take standard classes with normal students, they have a chaperon with them at all times.  You will never date Reina and then go out with other girls to make her jealous. ;_;   It's the only way to get into university, and the choices of universities you can get into is determined by your score.   It can also mean the difference between a life long white collar job or whatnot.        It depends on the college you want to get into but yes, students are very stressed out during this time because their future depends on it. In Japan it's hard to get in to college but easy to graduate, but in America it's relatively easy to get into college but more difficult to graduate.    It's better to make them socialize with normal people instead of treating them like special snowflakes or giving them Ritalin like in ameriland.    They are the most important exams you will take in your educational career as the university you go to will depend on your results, and that has more influence on your future job prospects than how you actually get on at university.    They are announcing something next month and many people are not working on anything for a long time. It makes sense for them to start acting independently.     To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd  It's not odd at all in an Asian country. An entire year is nothing when everyone else starts preparing for the exam since their first year of highschool.      I have faith in the Yamada. Hopefully they don't dissapoint with the finale like they did on Ep 11.       inb4 it's just another seasonal staff illustration thing        It just seems kind of odd to base what university you go to on one exam, rather than your overall academic performance.    I think they'll give a solid hint that Kumiko likes Shuichi otherwise they would never should have bothered with the whole Kumiko doesnt know about her feelings sub-plot.  What's Kumiko feeling here?  Abject despair that she'll never reach Reina's skill level?       I can only assume she is aiming for a very hard or unusual career or something, otherwise sperging out just because you want to get into liberal arts, marketing or nursery would be kind of stupid, any diploma from any college could pretty much do the job. I used to think that without a degree from a top tier university you'd be pretty much unemployed for life but it isn't really that important for most 'normal' jobs.      The kind of university you graduate from matters more in Japan. People and employers might look down on you if you're from a third-rate school. Even in the dating world they look at where you graduated from as a way of picking a mate. Probably because better school = better job = payed better = security.   In Aoi's case she'd already failed to get into the high school she wanted so she's already stressed out about veering off the path she wanted. I don't know if it will ever be mentioned what career she's going for but it must be something she really wants.      Do lacks a digital department, they can't be independent.      That doesn't matter, Do can't be independent because they're not a separate entity, they're a subsidiary owned entirely by KyoAni. Pretty much a KyoAni studio in Osaka with a fancy name.     Where is that pic of red rinnon blowing the paper? She has the guts to be in a position of authority.   red ribbon*    What the fuck is wrong with the Japanese male hair styles.    They have shit hair genetics that don't really allow them to have more than 3 styles.    I don't think it's going to be anything too overt. Maybe hints of them reconciling, but no strong romantic hints. Romance hasn't really been an important part of this show, so to make a big revelation of Kumiko realizing her love for Shuichi would feel out of place.  But I also don't think we're going to get any pathetic, cheap yuribait like episode 11 scene either. Yamada is doing the storyboard for this episode, and based on her previous work I doubt she'd stoop that low.     I finally understand the context of this picture.  Reina is murdering Kumiko.     Someone needs to shop Ufo-kun and a shadow of Reina with a knife.     No, I expect a solid one. They've been lacking really because they had to go crazy with the yuri bait.     Where is that image even from? Is it just fan art or an official one?     I finally understand  No anon, you don't.     That teacher hhhnnng   Kagerou class best class   Looks like Tenryuu gets a summer line.    Fusou    Kaga gets a new line too? Feels good man.    Didn't you read the tweets?<br/>    What did you expect from Kagafag aside from being obnoxious?   What do you guys think about this series?   nothings showing up    Literally first page of Sadpanda for One Punch Man   I see we're already at the   Onepunch-man has always been bad  phase.  Hopefully we'll loop back to sincere appreciation within a few years.        look it up   it's only six pages, with four actual content pages  wow it's like I'm really reading OPM      The only people who've been prasing OPM are the newfags who never read anything else from ONE, even MnO which is even more disjointed and fillery than OPM has much better writing and characters.   wow it's like I'm really reading OPM  It should only make your dick harder.      Onodera worst girl   We're almost on the same page OP, out with the old busted dere dere, in with the new tsun.  They're both the best.     Still much better than shitoge        Hi OP.        Her sister is a bigger shit than her. Truly a groundreaking accomplishment   The chapter is out.   from Ishibumi's blog  The BD's for S3 will be coming with a 6-part novel called "Highschool DxD EX"  We don't know how it fits into the timeline, but this may be a preview at the sequel to the series.   God from another world   4th user of Durandal   Black haired boy that uses lightning   RED HAIRED BOY WITH DRAGON AURA   Brown haired Angel with Dragon wings   Asia-kaasan   In xx years from now, a big war will occur.

But can she switch pieces though? her old master gave her 2 mutation bishops or some shit before  she smoked that motherfucker.     She was under a demon before? That's news to me. I must have forgot, I always thought she was under some kind of master not just a devil. Also I didn't know she had 2 mutation pieces.  So she's like Irina then? Not in any demon group but associated with them and counted in Issei's harem? That would make sense but it would be a bummer though.      She's either a Stray Devil or in Vali's peerage, if he has one. I don't remember     Vali's peerage  Vali has no peerage, remember he was not raised in devil society ,his team is just that a group of misfits that banded under him      She was under a demon before? That's news to me. I must have forgot, I always thought she was under some kind of master not just a devil. Also I didn't know she had 2 mutation pieces.  Anon thats what Koneko´s arc was all about, she didnt want to use her powers because she though she would go nuts and kill her master(Rias) just like Kuroka killed hers , which was not really about the power but the fact that like a lot of devils their old master was a douche and threatened Koneko.  thats also why Koneko was going to be executed, devils would not execute random cat girls for just killing some random non devil master/king(which are not even a thing in DxD if you think about it).           Togashi doesn't even have furniture except for that stool, apparently.    Why not just a burkha?    Considering he's married, I doubt it.    It was probably you can't show the kids it's ok to go through the first aid kit and treat themselves without letting their parents know </blockquote>]
