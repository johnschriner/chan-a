Also it's Madhouse so it wouldn't surprise me if some of the team also worked on Hellsing Ultimate.</br>    <br>sandman reference; you sir are a man of wealth and taste</br>  Surprise Buttsex face  <br>Shalltear is stated to be the most powerful Floor Guardian in Nazarick. Though I remember Ainz mentioning that Gargantua was "stronger" than her once. Maybe it was meant in terms of pure physical strength. Though Shalltear is pretty powerful with magic or with melee combat.</br>  <br>Albedo isn't a Floor Guardian per se, she's their leader. <br><br>Although that said, she's more built as a tank. We'll get to see her in armor next episode probably.</br></br></br>  <br>Surprised boning face more like.</br>  <br>You can already see it in the opening.</br>  <br>I'm still pretty sure Shalltear is stronger than her.  When she got mind controlled the plan was for a lot of the NPCs to face her together, so I think it's safe to say she's the most powerful of the lot. </br>  Shalltear needs to sort her out ASAP.  <br> *rattle rattle* <br> Not "eye, eye" <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RyS<wbr>Fr5Wbi4E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her boobplate is pretty sex</br>  <br>I want to have sex with her  and have her leave the armor on </br>  Is anyone else worried about the pacing being slightly slow? I expected ep 2 to end with Ainz gating into Carne village's slaughter, or at least to spot what was going on through the mirror<br><br>At this pace, it feels like we will be lucky to get to the graveyard fight, and can completely forget about shalltear's fight</br></br>  <br>We already have episode titles. Every volume is going to be 4 episodes.</br>  <br>More impactful compared to translating it as "cross dresser" imo. +1 to Funi</br>  <br>This is what I was saying after ep 1, but people kept acting like we'd be right on schedule to fit 3 volumes into 13 episodes. I'm just not seeing it. I think we'll be lucky to get through 2 volumes.</br>  <br>what type of face is THIS?</br>  <br>thank god. 'Girly boy' in Twintails was fucking disgusting.</br>  <br>Im a bit dissapointed. I liked the armor that appeared in the manga, which made it hard to guess her gender. You know, it looked (to me at least) very much like good, proper super heavy armor, the likes of which someone with 85 levels in different varieties of "tank" would have<br><br>5 levels as black guard (anti paladin)<br>10 levels as knight<br>10 levels as shield warrior<br>10 levels as warrior<br>etc...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 3 is "battle of carne village"<br>Episode 4 is "ruler of death"<br><br>Episode 5 is "The two adventurers", so it's the beginning of volume 2</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything is going at good pace. Next episode carne village+gazef comes, ep 4 angels and ep 5 we will have spooky adventures and Narberal.</br>  <br>The face of sex.</br>  <br>I'm with  on this one. I really liked the manga design. Boobplates set off the autist in me.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>I agree, that armor was so much better and fit more who she was.</br>  <br>the small skeletons in the catacombs were worse than the giant one and you know it</br>  <br>You're just going to have to deal Anon<br><br>Albedo has clearly been selected as main girl, so she's going to be sexed up as much as possible.</br></br></br>  So spoil me a little, are there other players that stayed until server shutdown?  <br>Read the LN</br>   Mfw This was basically Lord Nito's lair before all the undead bullshit   <br>if she gets excited this much, imagine how her ahegao will look when he conjures up a Greater Penis of Penetration+15 (enchant:fertility) to impregnate her?</br>  How much does the manga follow the LN?  So basically there are hundreds or NPC's in the guild but basically only the maids and the guardians have personality?  <br>100%<br><br> How much does it adapt compared to the LN? <br>70%, just like the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Leaves quite a bit out. Fairly entertaining and good for reaction images, though.</br>  <br>"Bitch" just means "slut" in Japan. She'd be the resident cocktease.</br>    Started reading the LN yesterday.<br>This shit is addicting, I love infodumps.</br>  <br>Nah they all have personalities, we just won't see everyone</br>  <br>uhmm.... that makes me think that Gazeff will get VEEEERY little camera time, unless its... let me think...<br><br>Battle of Carne Village<br>Show Theocracy knights attacking Carne for 2 seconds<br>Show Gazeff give his short speech and ride towards Carne<br>Showing Ainz as he watches the battle, then being shamed by Sebas into going to help.<br>Kill knight<br>Create Death Knight, send it off<br>Show Death Knight assfucking the other knights<br>Skip the scene with the knights mountin a last ditch attempt and their leader doing his very best only to have it count for nothing<br>Gazeff arrives and talks to Ainz<br>Gazeff rides off to fight the encircling theocracy knights<br>End of Episode<br><br>Ruler of Death<br>Gazeff fighting<br>Ainz switching places with him<br>Angels getting slaughtered<br>Ainz wins<br>Throne room scene where the guardians get all pumped up about conquering the world for Ainz<br>BRIEF scene in the dungeon/torture room<br>End episode<br><br>It feels as if they are going to have to cram up too much in two episodes now that they are so late.<br><br>I worry that ep 5 will be called The two adventurers only because at the VERY END we will see Narbel and Ainz entering Re Lantier, and the pacing will be more along the lines of:<br><br>Ep3 - Battle in Carne<br><br>Scene in throne room where Demiurge pumps everone up<br>Knights attacking Carne<br>Gazef Speech<br>Ainz sees stuff through the mirror, gates in<br>Kill knight, creates undead<br>End Episode<br><br>Ep 4 - Ruler of Death<br><br>Will be named like that because Ainz rules over or owns the DEATH knight.<br>Watch Death knight run around killing knights<br>Last stand scene by the plaza<br>Ainz shows up<br>Knighs run<br>Gazeff shows up, tries to recruit Ainz<br>Gazeff rides off to fight encircling Theocracy forces<br>End Episode<br><br>Ep 5 - The two adventurers<br>Everything that has to happen until the point we see Ainz and Naberal entering Re Lantier<br>End Episode<br><br>I really hope its the 1st and not the 2nd option, because if thats it we are only getting as far as the graveyard.<br><br>Oh and fuck spoilers AT LEAST read the manga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Best girl  <br>80% of the troops have personality the other 20% are the undead zombies and skeletons you see in MMO just waiting in a field waiting for you to bash their heads in.</br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br>There's really now need to show off the fact that you've read the source material, you know?</br>  <br>Its better than many other manga adaptations ive seen, where they fuck up pacing to incredible levels.<br><br>See: Shieldbro manga<br><br>Im a huge shieldbro fan, but I couldnt care less about the manga, even tho I also love manga. Just not THAT one</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, cockteaser is different from slut. She would be the resident target of slut jokes<br><br>"The other day during the Nazarick anniversary party, Albedo was playing the guitar. She asked if there were requests, and someone asked her to play something everyone knew, so she pulled off her skirt"<br><br>"How do you know Albedo is sick? she's lying down instead of on all four"<br><br>Like that</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>When he started just telling about it I lost it. Want expecting that.</br>   All them sounds of bones clacking against each other in Episode 2 <br><br>AOTY</br></br>  <br>im not showing off, im worried</br>  <br>I had to do it</br>  <br>panic.jpg</br>  <br><br><br><br>Sweet, thanks. I'm not too big on reading a lot of text</br></br></br></br>  oh god, yet another "adaptation of an LN where he's trapped in another world!"<br><br>please tell me this one does something new and good for once</br></br>  <br>Bad bait son. You're gonna have to cast a few more times to catch em all.</br>  MC being a skeleton is so fucking metal. Name me other examples  Can't we have at least ONE fantasy mmorpg anime without this haremshit going?<br>SaO was somewhat bearable until Asuna showed up.<br>Danmachi was fine for half episode, when they already shoved 4 girls up everyone's ass.<br><br>So far there's only 2, I hope it doesn't grow.<br>R-right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> oh god, yet another "adaptation of an LN where he's trapped in another world!" <br> Implying the world isn't trapped with him </br></br>  i wont believe she is inlove until her pupils turn into hearts  <br>no I'm serious, that cliche is super trendy right now and usually not that great, so it's easy to be biased against it. I'm not saying it HAS to be bad, just that I don't trust it to be any better unless someone who's good at writing for once mixes things up. which I doubt, but I could be wrong.</br>  <br> It'll grow, but in case you didn't notice he is a fucking skeletor and doesn't give a fuck about it.<br> People wanting to  bone  Ainz is just played for comedy, nothing else.</br></br>  <br>How the hell does this thing have a penis?<br><br>Impossible.</br></br></br>  <br>You know right that "MC is a different world" has been a recurring plot from ancient times? Just look at the Odyssey</br>  7th Floor guy is pissed that he gave a ring to the Elf-Trap over him right?  <br>well, the main character's a skeleton. He starts out overpowered instead of having to get there, everyone of his NPCs already likes him instead of the reverse (shield hero) or mildly uncomfortable around him (mushoku tensei), and anyone else that sees him shits their pants instead of underestimating him.<br><br>Also, it's less "trapped in another world, take care of myself" and more "this place is great, lets go explore shit and eventually take over"<br><br>it's bait but I can't help responding.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so far there's only 2 <br>Log Horizon got 2 seasons just recently you know, each with 2 cour.</br></br>  <br>a-at least the boy is a girl</br>  <br> Impossible. <br> Implying </br></br>  Pssst, guys, did no one notice in which hand and finger Mare worn the ring? Think about it.  <br>Does Dothack count?<br>I'm 90% sure shield hero doesn't really count if it get's an anime, as tanukigirl has made it super clear it's not gonna be a harem, but there's still tons of women.<br>and as <br>said, log horizon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  tanukigirl has made it super clear it's not gonna be a harem <br>  he didn't read the WN </br></br>  Is the red-armor-white-hair chick with the lance or whatever in the OP a legitimate threat, or just a goon of the week? Only seen the 2 episodes, don't know shit yet but it looks neat. It would be nice if someone other than momonga turns out to be a player character at some point, and can match him because they were from a good guild too.  <br>Demiurge meant what he said. He wasn't lying. He's the biggest bro you'll find in the novels next to Cocytus, of course.</br>  <br> You have already seen her, anon.</br>  <br>but why are both siblings crossdressing.</br>  <br>Uncle Cocytus is the coolest!<br>Those fucking lizardmen are so lucky. I bet he celebrates every time another is born and gives magical items as gifts on every wedding.<br><br>I really wanna read about how the lizardmen lives are now with Cool Uncle Cocytus in charge<br><br>It is a sunny day in the kingdom of Re Lantier when a group of adventurers set out for the great northern lake to find out why the merchants who usually cross the frontier from the theocracy in the north are not making it all the way through anymore<br><br>A group of 5 mithril adventurers, composed by an archer, a wizard, two warriors and a healer.<br><br>Zella, the healer, is wearing a blue robe with tanned leather protecting her chest and shoulders. She rides sidewise on the saddle, with the soft blue robe leaving her sandal-clad feet exposed.<br><br>"Lovo -she asks the wizard in their group- what can we expect in the great lake?"<br><br>Lovo is wearing smooth black pants with no shirt, but a open robe in purple hangs from his shoulders like an hybrid between a shirt and a cloak. He is also wearing a bright red berett over his smooth bald head.<br><br>"Well, there are some large and dangerous monsters in the area, such as hydras, but they normally stay in the water so they don't have to support their full weight. Other than that, there are large crocodiles and some lizardmen tribes, but they are fairly primitive and have, at best, slingshots and clubs."<br><br>"I see? so do you think a hydra is attacking the caravans? or the lizardmen?"<br><br>"Well, the lizardmen are primitive, but not overly aggressive to strangers. They do war with eachother quite often, though, but some lizardmen who embrace the adventurer's lifestyle, so they are not too barbaric, you know?"<br><br>"Then, hydra?"<br><br>"Seems the most likely option"<br><br>A few days later, as they cross the woodlands south of the lake and grow close enough to enter the marshlands, they spot a elevated stone road making an almost straight line north.<br><br>1/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Demiurge seems genuinely interesting compared to some of the others, clever and insightful at the same time. I'm hoping for a couple good keikaku moments in the future, especially if they involve him being devious or cruel.</br>  I love how Overlord threads are just skeleton puns and few actual discussion about the series<br> They're perfect. </br>  so wait, albedo is only into momonga cause he edited her description to say that, right? so then whoever wrote shalltear's description, wrote her to love him too? or is something else going on that I'm missing  <br>You're missing the light novel. Shalltear has a lot of fetishes which include necrophilia.</br>  <br>Shalltear is just a slut who loves alphas like Momonga.</br>  <br>I thought it was agreed upon that he would have multiple wives but they were just fighting over who was the head wife</br>  <br> He won't get to shine in the anime, but he gets some focus during volume 6.<br> He is the most intelligent among the floor guardian and his scenes with Ainz are funny as hell because Demiurge is an evil mastermind while Ainz is kind of a normal guy, but his loyalty makes him believe that any plan he comes up with was already considered by Ainz and that he was just waiting for Demiurge to say it.<br> Like:<br>  Ainz-sama, we should send agents to this location <br> Yeah, good idea. <br>  Oh, I see. You were actually planning to do this from the beginning. Sasuga Ainz-sama, your intelligence knows no bounds. <br>  No, I... <br>  You don't need to say anymore, this humble servant feels so stupid for thiking that you wouldn't consider such an obvious thing. <br>  Y-yeah, you are right. Good one. Demiurge. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>so it's not HIM per se that she loves, but stuff about him, gotcha. albedo on the other hand seems like she'd be full yandere for him regardless of anything he ever did, even if he changed.</br></br>  <br>Overlord threads are probably the most comfy in /a/ right now</br>  <br>She's a legitimate threat. Hell, she's actually the worst enemy for Ainz-sama to ever fight.</br>  <br>I want cocytus to be cool uncle.</br>  <br><br>"Uh... this is new" -lovo says as they help their horses get unto the elevated road.<br><br>It is built spotlessly on top of a stone platform that sinks deep into the mud, obviously supported by good and solid foundations, with any splash of water from climbing unto the road itself being sucked down and discharged by the sides.<br><br>Effectively, an excellent stone road with a great drainage system. It is wide enough for two wagons to pass eachother with no problem, and the stones on top of the road are all cut in a seemingly perfect hexagonal shape.<br><br>"I never heard of a road like this" -says Cato, the younger of their two warriors, who is wearing a enchanted armor of studded leather.<br><br>"I had never seen such a road, either, but isn't this like the roads they have in the empire?" -asks Zella<br><br>"No, the roads in the capital are good, but not like this." -Lovo had dropped out from the empire's magic academy, but was a resident of the capital and knew of paved roads, albeit not like this.<br><br>After wondering about it for a while, they decide to follow it north, and eventually come to spot a tall structure of stone standing next to the road. It looks like a small house, albeit it only has one room, and they can see some movement inside.<br><br>They send Cato and Ramon, their other warrior, to see what's going on, and both warriors run back in a rush after taking a look inside.<br><br>"There's a troll! an armored troll, inside!"<br><br>"What?!" x3<br><br>Of course, trolls are not unknown to adventurers, and can live almost anywhere. Being practically unkillable unless you use fire or acid to stop their incredible regeneration, they are powerful monsters that can easily wipe a party of unprepared adventurers.<br><br>However, to see a troll living inside such a fine building, wearing what looks like super heavy, high quality magical armor its a completely different level of threat.<br><br>As they are discussing about it, the troll shouts from inside its booth...<br><br>2/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So she's actually Alucard? May have to marathon this at end of season then.</br>  <br>Yes, comfy...</br>    <br>So then what was Ainz's role in the guild before, other than having to take up the administrative role to prevent it from dying? Was he more of a veteran raid coordinator or just some typical CC'ing tool that never made any decisions or had to think about how to plan the best way to tackle a complex situation?</br>  Libido vs Lamprey  <br>Well, this one has the fact that the MC is a clackety rackety spooklord skeltal going for it.</br>  <br><br>Specially with all the hugging and cute magical girls.</br></br>  <br>Oh wow, gesugao if fucking great</br>  <br>He was the mailman.</br>  <br>Yes, more fanart of best girl.</br>  <br>He was upper management.</br>  <br>Ainz was pretty good at Pvp and organizing raid. Simply put organizing a party and being able to manipulate large scale politics do not usually go hand to hand, despite what Log Horizon would try to make you think.</br>  <br><br>What?</br></br>  <br>Since his NPC was the one who guarded the treasury, couple that with his item knowledge and that he is a mage, it wouldn't be a stretch to assume that he was the booky.</br>    <br><br>Can't a skeleton fantasize about uncle Cocytus?</br></br>  I papa bones going to save the village next week?  <br>I think so. He will at least look at it.</br>  <br><br>"Hey, you runts, you better not be thinking bout not paying your toll, you hear me!?" -the troll roars/talks in surprisingly good [language]<br><br>"Uh... let's... yeah, this needs some investigation" -says Lovo as he approaches<br><br>"Toll, sir?" -he asks the troll<br>"Yeah, you think this here fine road just popped out of nowhere? you have to pay toll if you want to use the Great One's roads!"<br>"I ...see. And what do we get from paying the toll?"<br>"You use the road. I walk down the road twice a day, kicking down crocs and monsters who may have climbed unto it. Bandits too, if any is stupid enough to try muggin in the Great One roads."<br>"Oh! alright..."<br><br>Half a day later, they had already seen that one troll once, and another at least one more time. Indeed, the booth trolls seem to patrol the road regularly and efficiently, making them glad to have paid the toll and have their tickets to show for it.<br><br>"You think the merchants refused to pay the toll?" -asks Zella<br>"It's not that expensive. It is a very good road, and we can't complain about its safety" -says Ramon.<br>"Indeed, it is a very reasonable toll" -says Cato<br><br>Soon, they spot the white walls of a city on the lake. <br><br>The road comes to a T where it continues straight north, with the other option being to turn towards the city in the lake.<br><br>The cross road has smooth, curcular arms reaching towards the city, allowing for traffic from the north and south to enter the city without having to get stuck at the intersection.<br><br>"I thought you said there were only lizardmen in the area?" -asks Zella<br>"Well, there are dwarves in the mountains to the north. If it is dwarves. all this stoneworlk makes good sense, now" -says Lovo<br>"Oh! of course!"<br>"Still, I came here just 5 years ago. That beautiful city and this magnificent road... dwarves are really something"<br><br>Thus, they turned towards the city...<br><br>3/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably, if I was a betting man it will probably end when he tele-swaps with the Captain.</br>  <br>Stop.</br>  spokky skleleton should have just edited his flavor text to make himself smarter. it would just be cosmetic at first but when the game goes real then it would become true, right?<br><br>or do stuff like make a box that you've never opened and change the description to say stuff like "inside this box is super rare magic jewels that are crazy powerful and expensive enough to buy a country" or someshit. "this box contains an artifact that lets the user travel in time at will" or "this box contains an item that prevents any kind of death to whoever is wearing it even by accident"</br></br>  <br>No</br>  So, how many nicknames does Ainz has in these threads.  <br>Heinz Ketchup (tm)<br>Ainz<br>Momonga<br>Papa Bones<br><br>expect more</br></br></br></br></br></br>  See this what do?  I dunno about you guys but the OP and ED are both fucking SEX. I'm tempted to just loop them together infinitely and listen to it all day in the background.  <br>Demand a harem of burly lizardmen</br>  <br><br>Mate calling</br></br>  <br>M'bonga</br>   play VR MMORPG <br> anyone not human is extremely persecuted <br> demihumans have to stick to themselves in far corners to survive <br>the fuck? I don't think I'd want to keep playing a game like that. since when did being Alliance become more acceptable than Horde anyways? buncha mommy-moderated PC fucks. in real games, the "good" guys are always the losing team.</br></br></br>  <br><br>As they approach, they are once again, surprised.<br><br>Lizardmen are leisurely swimming about near the city inside large pools where the sillhouettes of large fish can be seen.<br><br>The pools are surrounded by silver-looking metallic fences with bars that sink deep into the water, out of their sight.<br><br>From time to time, a lizardman throws a large fish into a large floating basket. These large baskets, once full of fish, are pushed by the lizardmen towards the city.<br><br>There is also a boat from where a lizardmen is throwing feed into the water. The boat is followed by a massive school of large fish that happily swim to the surface to try and receive the feed before it even hits the water.<br><br>As they finally approach the city gates, they see four lizardmen guards, wielding fine looking spears of black wood with glowing spearheads of some unknown metal.<br><br>"Uh... is it alright if we go in?" -asks Lovo<br>"Sure. Just don't mess up inside, so we don't mess up your insides" -says one of the guards<br>"Alright"<br><br>Inside, they see a system of straight stone roads that double as docks for hundreds of beautiful, large boat houses.<br><br>Lizardmen are either swimming about or walking up and down the roads, wearing open shirts of some unknown, smooth and bright fabric.<br><br>Ahead, there is a large stone platform where about two dozen carriages and wagons are parked, right before a three story building made of stone from which the scent of food and other goods can be felt.<br><br>"Uncle Cocytus, can I get a hot dog?" -asks a small lizardmen child that is riding on the shoulders of a spotlessly white insect-man<br><br>The odd creature is swarmed by young lizardmen children, and even with the difference between the expressions of humanoids and lizardmen, the party members can tell that they are all having a fun time.<br><br>A sign on the entrance of the large building says "Great Lake Central Market"<br><br>"I guess we found the missing merchants?" -says Ramon- "Let's go in and browse"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nigga it would probably be because lel epic meme fags that non-humans are getting attacked<br><br> and /tg/ </br></br></br>  <br>So yeah, I think Cocytus will bump the lizardmen from warriors and braves to at least lancers and longbowmen, maybe even crossbowmen, with good roman-style roads, stainless steel fences for their fishing farms, and roman-style shopping malls.<br><br>Plus, the merchants can buy super high quality Nazarick products at the market, and then go back to the Theocracy and sell them there for huge profits.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually reading the WN right now. Around 180. Tanuki is sending glares at anyone getting close to shield.</br>  <br>The author is borrowing from D&amp;D very very heavily. He probably envisioned Iggdrassil like a massive game of D&amp;D with tons of players.<br><br>There is a reason adventurers in D&amp;D are known as "murder hobos" you know? in the typical D&amp;D game you CAN play as a monster, but be ready for 99% of the civilized world to try to kill you on sight</br></br></br>  <br>yeah call us when he builds up the village, then you'll defiantly see that it becomes a harem.</br>  <br>Im pretty sure the whale raped him in beast mode</br>  <br>Are you literally retarded?</br>  Any translators here?<br>http://imoutoliciouslnt.blogspot.ca<wbr>/2015/03/overlord-drama-cd-volume-1<wbr>-sealed-evil.html<br><br>Been waiting for track 9 but waiting is painful.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>It's like D&amp;D and EVE's love child, which then had a love child with minecraft's sandbox world, which then had a love child with mythology.<br><br>Seriously though, the cutthroat setting is very much EVE-like, right down to large player corporations (or guilds) keeping secrets as long as possible (such as the wormholes that one EVE guild managed to hoard for a long while when it first came out). Yggdrasil just adds more direct requests to the devs for sudden game alterations when a World Item is used.</br></br></br>  <br>Its a harem he gives the shield to every girl in the story before that its a copy of TTGL</br>  <br>Wasn't there a game that got criticized for flat out using the word "trap" in its translation?<br>I think it was a NISA game or something.</br></br>  <br>It was... Akiba's Trip.<br><br>A character that is KNOWN for being mean to others on purpose calls another character a trap, as an INSULT.<br><br>People flipped the fuck out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was Xseed with Akiba's Trip.</br>  <br>bongabonga<br>bonzie<br>Momomon<br>mongrel<br>Bonesalot<br>mahou bone-o<br>not-skeletor<br>rattles</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wait which character<br><br>was there even a trap in UU</br></br></br>  <br>One of the posters on the twitter/2chan piss take calls another poster a trap.</br>  <br> defiantly </br>  <br>Momo</br>  <br><br><br>The hell is gesugao?<br>Google gives me nothing, but if it's what I think it is, yes, it's fantastic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> being offended by fake internet <br> being offended by fake internet that particularly shows the endeavors of a chan  <br> being offended by chans </br></br></br>  <br><br>Where is this information from/ I can't find the Raws...</br></br>  <br>Humanity Fuck Yeah faggotry has always been extremely cancerous.<br><br>Also apparently this game didn't consider killing non-human player characters as pk so those who wanted to face other players but not receive a penalty for it used non-humans to do so.<br><br>Basically, this entire game is what happens when roleplayers have the funds to make their dreams come true but lack the intelligence to balance it properly for everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>wasn't Rubedo supposed to be stronger than any NPC in nazarick, despite not being a floor guardian? iirc being a floor guardian was about more than just being good at fighting</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, conservative non-techsavvy folks are generally quite offended when exposed to 'chans. The culture shock is quite a thing.</br>  How strange, I'm actually liking a MMO anime from a LN. wonder if this will make me stop being nazi with them  <br><br>Did you like it dot.hack?, i think that was the orignal MMO anime even if it wasn´t the one that actually made it popular.</br></br>  <br>GATE seems rather pleasant this season too, despite not being "trapped" and not an MMO. I look forward to seeing more alternative ways to write stories featuring modern culture intersecting with fantasy worlds. Especially if there's some political intrigue, but that's just a bonus.</br>  <br>I can't believe no one posted this yet</br>  <br>It's been posted so many times in so many of these threads that it's the default answer in our hearts.</br>  <br>Shieldbro manga has great art though. The hugging scene after the duel was much better than the LN version, even just comparing the very page itself and not the build up the manga has over the LN's single illustration.<br><br>But it does pace very very quickly. More importantly the biggest factor is the LN being so drastically changed it's no longer the same story as of the current chapter.</br></br></br>  I just want an anime where the "MMO" was never real in the first place but rather a tool to trick gamers into subjugating a foreign world, and the player-characters are sentient consciousnesses that are being controlled by the players of the MMO against their will to do morally reprehensible things so they start rebelling, but nobody from our world actually ever gets "transported" there or vice versa. Is that too much to ask?  <br>Because their creator was godlike.<br><br>She loved traps. I think she was an eroge voice actress too but not 100%</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you write in the garbage LN style when you're writing in English? weebs are weird</br>  <br> the gamer </br>  <br>I remember not liking it much. <br><br>GATE is probably the single most awful thing they could animate this year. its awfulness derives from the fat that it throws away the interesting premises almost instantly. Outbreak company played it in a much more subtle and interesting way, even if it wasn't a great product for sure</br></br></br>  <br>But that's strong. Demihumans don't have the same disadvantage as Heteromorphic, in fact Demihumans are the tryhard race of Yggdrasil since they are overall the best in balance between racial and job levels.<br><br>Heteromorphic races are not persecuted because they are different, they are persecuted because in Yggdrasil they, unlike human and demihuman races, do not give you a penalty/red name when you PK them. This means you're free to PK Heteromorphic races all day, but they can't do the same without getting flagged.<br><br>Demi-humans don't have this flaw at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  So what's the deal with the borken fluffy girl  <br><br><br><br><br>It was literally said at the begining<br><br>Herohero: Still I'm surprised this place is still around<br>Momonga: Well, it is the GUILD LEADER'S job to maintain the guild after all.<br><br>He is/was the big bony boss Guildmaster. It's why one of the guardians said that he was the one that stood above the other Supreme Ones (Guild members/creators)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but that's not even close at all anon and you know it.</br>  <br>it got the controlling part right at least<br><br>though shitty controls and HUD</br></br></br>  <br>She's an Area Guardian, just like Pandora's Actor. But yes, she's strong enough to make Shalltear look weak, and can easily crush decked out Ainz.<br><br>Chances are she's an automaton made with the Caloric stone, so she would be the only NPC who is inherently world class.</br></br></br>  what happens to momonga or his npc buddies if they die?  <br>If you paid attention to that scene, they implied right afterwards that Momonga wasn't the original guild leader, or even the guild leader at the time that herohero last showed up. He simply took up the role of guild leader when nobody else would so that the guild could continue operating.</br>  Momonga's skull is fucking weird. It barely looks human. What the hell is he supposed to look like with flesh?  <br>The Guild was apparently run by majority decision anyways, he calls Guild Leader basically a ceremonial title for them.</br>  <br><br>All three of those are LN adaptations. So take from that what you will.</br></br>  <br>So basically just Ender's Game or that manga where some dude does the same thing in SEA but with more EDGE? Sounds stupid and I don't see how the rpg-elements would fit make any sense</br>  <br>Yeah Touch Me was the first Guild Master before they became Ainz Ooal Gown, giving the position to Momonga once Nazarick was formed.</br>  <br>It's a known fact (at least on /tg/) that liches commonly start fucking with their physical form sometime after they become skeletons, and some even do it before that point. Probably looked relatively normal "before"</br>  <br>Sora, from YGO Arc-V.<br>A delicious shota.</br></br>  <br>You ever see a lich with flesh on?</br>  <br>I know sora, and I know he's delicious.<br><br>Is gesugao just him, then? I was thinking it was the orgasmic crazy face most main yugioh villans get at some point in recent years, and some heroes.</br></br></br>  Guide to guardians because people keep asking<br><br>There are 3 types of guardians<br><br>Floor Guardians<br>Victim, Gargantua, and the main cast<br><br>Area Guardians<br>Those 3 demon guys that follow Demiurge around, Sebastian, Rubedo and a bunch of others<br><br>Other<br>Pandora's actor<br><br>Rubedo is the most powerful because she's an optional boss designed to be beast in melee<br><br>Gargantua is the single most powerful entity in Nazarick but nobody ever counts him because he was a gift given to a bunch of guilds after an update that nerfed their shit and as such is mindless and more like part of the furniture then an actual guardian<br><br>Shalltear is the most powerful of the Floor guardians 1v1 because she's a tank/assassin that self heals with almost every spell or attack and was made to decimate casters<br><br>Cocytus is the best pure warrior of the Floor Guardians but Sebastian and Rubedo are better pure warriors because Dovahkin and whatever Rubedo is are designed to fuck bitches, although Cocytus is a better off-tank than Sebastian so it evens out<br><br>The Twins and Demiurge were both likely designed to be group fights but I don't know enough to comment<br><br>Albedo is a tank and made to fight alongside Sebastian so while she has likely the best defensive stats of the guardians (again not including Gargantua) she lacks the offensive oomph to beat them<br><br>Victim is a gimmick made to destroy large groups and at worst thin them out before they make it to the guild hall proper<br><br>Pandora's actor is made to screw people over by attacking whatever their defense is weakest against and be another dick move within the treasury since anyone that beats him has to then fight an army of golems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pandora's Actor is an Area Guardian, which his designation is obviously the Treasury.</br>  <br>Did they ever explain how Nazarick has so many customized high-leveled npcs when it was stated that the total levels of all customizable npcs is 700?</br>  <br>They bought extra I think. Tabula in particular used up a lot more than he was supposed to so he footed the bill at onepoint.</br>  <br>700 is for the guild hall, that's why all the combat maids are around level 40-60</br>  <br>There's no real power rankings. Each of the guardians are made for a certain task and they are unrivaled in that task. Shaltear is supposedly the strongest offensive guardian. Albedo is supposedly the strongest defensive. Gargantua is said to be the "strongest" but never explained in what way he's "strong"</br>  <br>There are real power rankings, some of them can explicitly beat the others at fights. Also, its very likely Sebas' dragon form can overpower Shalltear and since she is not too well specialized against great warriors she would likely lose.</br>  <br>She was, so much that her little brother who was also in the guild was scared of watching too much hentai because he might hear his sister.</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl coming through</br></br>  <br>The game was literally P2W.</br>  <br><br>Best chair.</br></br>  I really wanna start reading the LN but at the same time I kinda wanna just ride along as an anime-onlyfag, at least until it's done airing.  <br>That is fucking amazing. I don't want to love this show on two episodes and be hurt but after that tid bit I want to believe.</br>  <br>The anime seems to be going at least as far as the LNs are currently translated, excluding the bit of volume 5 that's out and a later volume that someone else has started translating.</br>  <br> hasn't read the manga or LN <br>You got something to look forward to next ep.</br></br>   It's time.   <br> Prison School is just Diabolik Lovers for boys. <br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>But Diabolik Lovers is hilarious.<br><br>I'll probably watch the second season as well, as long as they continue to treat bitch-chan like trash every episode, instead of trying to keep a serious and boring plot like the second half of the first season.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking DL <br>You're in the wrong thread, anon.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but screenshots from the show are often posted on a/ and that shit looked hilarious.</br>  <br>You don't like comedy gold?</br>  So the dorky LN is some crazy harem? Why do LNs never get translated?  <br>Is RJ supposed to be a bad cook too?</br>  <br>Maybe written in the official characterization for authors of officail works. <br><br>At least based on her lines she isn't - though she doesn't have hourly lines.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, TTK's harem, Zuihou is main heroine.</br>  I want to make Zuihou a mother and raise a happy family with her.  <br>Is Isokaze about to give you just milk?

Who wins in a fight to the death?<br><br>Can there even be a winner?</br></br>  One is planet-busting, the other two are not.  <br>What Alucard are we talking about?<br>If it's Pre-Schrodinger Arcueid wins<br>If it's Post-Schrodinger Alucard wins<br>Kiss Shot can't do shit, Vlad Tepes and Archtype-Earth aren't Oddities.</br></br></br></br>  Count Dracula himself vs some whore from a universe that ignores physics for plot purposes vs not even a vampire. I can't tell you who would win but I can tell you who would lose.  <br>This is the only way Kiss Shot can lose. She's immortal as long as there are people who believe in her existence. <br><br> I guess by that logic, she'd still be kept alive by the fact that the two enemies know of her and her powers.  </br></br></br>  Arcueid wins. She can never die so long as the earth still exists.  <br> She's immortal as long as there are people who believe in her existence. <br>Only in NisiOisiN's universe. This fight doesn't happen in said universe, due to copyright restrictions. Even if it did, she's fighting against Count Fucking Dracula.</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded nigga. Who determines whose universe it takes place in. The only way for things to be _fair_ is for it to be a shared universe where all the powers are at their max.</br>  <br>What determines max? Do you know who Count Fucking Dracula is?</br>  <br>Isn't Arc able to bend reality at will?</br>  <br>Bending reality involves the creation and manipulation of closed space, and at least Alucard in his anime form could do that much.</br>  <br>Aruceid&gt;Alucard&gt;power gap&gt;Kiss-shot</br>  <br>Bro, Kiss Shot is the strongest vamp in her universe. A universe that allows for these type of "fictional" entities to exist. Which means either she is the actual embodiment of Drac in her universe or he exists but ain't shit compared to her. So get fukt, homey.</br>  You're all small-time  We had this exact thread already go away.  <br>Dracula doesn't exist in this universe because of copyright restrictions. If he did, she would no longer be the strongest vamp in her universe.</br>  <br>He would be nothing without that parasite.</br>  <br> Implying the earth can't be destroyed </br>  <br>He even corrected the "room" loophole.. Pretty sad honestly.</br>  <br>Yeah the one with the terrible voice actress cant shatter planets.<br><br>Normal people could defeat her, remember how araragi got his powers?<br><br><br>arcueid can be killed easely aswell, kiss shot is not immortal as long as there people who believe in her. kill her normaly and she will die.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Arcuied could pretty much do that. Like reset all of earth and kill every human.<br><br>Alucard is pretty much not connected to space and time so with enough effort he could do just that.</br></br></br>  Shiki can kill all 3.  <br> &gt;Implying the earth can't be destroyed <br> Implying Kiss-shot and Alucard can survive in space <br>We Frieza now</br></br></br>  <br>I guess Tsukihimi Shiki couldn't see Alucard and Kiss Shot's lines while KnK Shiki would</br>  Kiss-shot comes from a bad writer and the setting she's from is very sparsely explained.  <br>Well, both of the others are still stronger. She literally can't kill them.<br><br>Her sword, that damages oddities, wouldn't affect someone like Arcueid and I'm pretty sure Alucard wouldn't either thanks to not really being anchored to space/time.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck couldnt he survive in space? he survived the muslim atempt at conquering europe and defended it. I think surviving space is easy.<br><br><br>Alucard was most likely captured after the self defense crusades, as when the muslim moors invaded european coastal towns and decided who to castrate and who to kill before enslaving the rest of whatever white person that would face the horror of the moors.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course they could do that but would they? That implies they have full knowledge of where her abilities come from. <br><br><br>Define "oddity" or even the actual japanese word used.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But is there anyone who can kill Nrvnqsr?</br>  Alucard got literally buttfucked muslims.  <br>Alucard has in his possession muslims that have been sodomized?<br><br> grammar's important, anon  </br></br></br>  Madara Uchiha, Edo Tensei, blah blah blah  <br>But which Madara Uchiha are we talking about though?</br>  <br> Why the fuck couldnt he survive in space? <br>Kill Yourself</br></br>  <br>Even Arcueid can't kill Nrvnqsr and she has the most firepower out of the vampires in OP.</br>  <br>She can, she just needs to go Warcueid or Earth.</br>  Everytime<br><br>Kissshot would not stand a chance<br><br>Arcueid v Alucard is Unstoppable Object v Unmovable Force.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alucard has all the time in the universe to learn it. Arcuied battles crazier concepts in the form of the DAA. <br><br>You do realize her sword works sort of like Gaia's will? Guess who's part of Gaia?</br></br></br>  <br>It's clear Arc is above and beyond the other two, she's basically a non factor as there isn't anything to discuss with her.</br>  <br>No she can't<br> "Chaos itself is a world of its own, fusing heaven and earth. To destroy the chaos that is your flesh would require enough power to destroy the entire world. Ever since the Earth was created, nothing has had such power." <br>From Arcueid herself</br></br></br>  <br>This nigga gets it</br>  <br>What do we call 2 sets of dubs?</br>  <br>Out of all the bullshit entities in the Nasuverse, there's not one that can physically destroy a planet? <br><br>Bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Alucard pre-Schrödinger is just a much weaker of Nrvnqsr</br>  <br>The answer is... WEREWOLF QUEEN! THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS WEREWOLF QUEEN!</br>  <br>Throw him into space.</br>  <br>Earth itself is the main driving force behind everything that happens in the Nasuverse. <br><br>Primate Murder and Counter Guardians are proof of that.</br></br></br>  <br>How is that going to kill Chaos?<br> Chaos [Term] <br> That which has no form. That which will become everything. That which lacks direction. That which will not take form without direction. That which has no meaning. That which should not have meaning.  <br> That is chaos. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If Earth is so broken why can't it defend itself against Meteors and Comets that can extinguish life on the planet? <br><br>Space: 1<br>Nasuverse Earth: 0</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair Archetype can bypass his durabilit by dropping him into a gap between space time. She does that in one of her win quotes.</br>  <br> Wants the Dinosaurs off of it <br> Lets meteor kill them <br> Nothing has hit Earth since humans existed because Gaia/Alaya doesn't want it to happen <br><br>It only cares about big threats</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Arc can reset the planet to it's original state at the most but not destroy it. Zeltrach used up most of his power stopping somethign moonsized from dropping but that's tiny compared to the earth. Sword Emperor may be able to get that long, but I believe it's something that is intertwined somehow.<br><br>Even the other Aristotles, beings that may be able to do that, won't because they're buddies with Gaia.</br></br></br>  <br>Does this mean she could beat Alucard then who essentially is disconnected from it?</br>  Arcueid winns my heart. Kiss Shot my dick. Alucard getts nothing.  <br>I realy need to play MB again.<br>I forgot most of the arcade stories and winquotes.<br> If only I wasn't as bad in fighting games </br></br></br>  Demonbane.  <br>Alucard gets your blood</br>  <br>If it wanted Dinos dead it could have done something better than wait a few million years for a comet large enough to hit come by. <br>Like sic Archer-kun at them, Archer-kun loves Dinos and Rhinos</br></br>  <br>Besides the point<br><br>Nasuverse Earth is self-sustaining. It will stay alive as long as it wants to be.</br></br></br>  <br>Archer-kun can only come out to play when some dumbfuck decides to bully mankind.</br>  <br>Archer-kun is pretty useless, isn't he?</br>  <br>well actualy Archer-kun just comes out when humanity doesn't stop hitting itself.<br>When other's bully mankind then the real heroic spirits get send to deal with it</br></br>  <br>Speaking of CG, wouldn't there be an Arturia CG? There should be a possibility out there where she actually wins the grail and her contract with the world is established.<br><br>Imagine a full powered Arturia. Jesus.<br><br>It probably gets really awkward when both are summoned together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer-kun became Archer-kun precisely because he's useless.</br>  <br>Nah, it's just that he only gets let out whenever there's a big bully and he usually gets so excited at the prospect of getting to play, he ends up using him for target practice. And everyone else nearby.<br><br><br>Humanity bullying itself was exactly was I was referring to when I said "some dumbfuck". <br><br><br>That may just be the reason she's in GO. Or maybe it's a Saber still on the hill. Or she got bored of Avalon. Or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Imagine a full powered Arturia. Jesus. <br>Not any stronger than the Arturia we see.<br>Except if you mean summoned by the world because the containers are designed to limit servants because the grail couldn't handle even one otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be a bit odd, but I imagine it wouldn't be that awkward<br> H-hey so did Britain get saved? <br> lol iunno multiverse </br></br></br>  <br> That may just be the reason she's in GO. Or maybe it's a Saber still on the hill. Or she got bored of Avalon. Or something. <br>Or it's the same reason why Scatchach is in GO while she was said to have become immortal in HA.<br> Money </br></br></br>  <br>(in space)</br>  So if nobody can kill Nrvnqsr, that means nobody can kill Wallachia either? <br><br>Outside of stupid eyehax, of course.</br></br>  <br>Yup that one. I mean CG Archer is wanked to be ridiculously strong or at least strong enough to do his job.<br><br>Arturia with her spear and excalibur, the sword, powered by humanity's hope, being powered by humanity itself should have more fire power.</br></br></br>  <br>Both are pretty different. Nero is something that has a ton of lives and regen but Wallachia is a phenomenon.<br><br>Sorta like a game where you have an onject with infinite durability and them you have the wind which is just a function.</br></br></br>  <br>Not realy.<br>They are completly different.</br></br>  <br>Nero Chaos can be killed by destroying Soil of Genesis, Wallachia can't be killed as he has become a phenomenon.</br>  <br> Nero Chaos can be killed by destroying Soil of Genesis <br>Are you retarded?<br> Wallachia can't be killed as he has become a phenomenon. <br>You obviously are</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least post explanations if you're disagreeing, pally.</br>  <br>And Alucard would just eat her, and then gain that power for himself</br>  <br>Soil of Genesis is just a spell that Nrvnqsr learned from Roa utilizing a part of his chaos to trap Arc.<br><br>I don't even know why you think becoming a phenomenon makes Wallachia unkillable.</br></br></br>  <br>That match would last five or ten minutes tops. Alucard is some kind of immortal God-King, and I don't think the other two are on that level. Especially since he has that "only a man can kill me" rule.</br>  <br>You shouldn't talk shit if you have no clue about the contestants.</br>   have masochistic curiosity to watch a dub <br> all the dub voice actors sound like they're reading off the script <br><br>how do dubfags deal with this?</br></br></br>   dubfags <br> watching anime <br><br>Nigga most of them just have anime playing in the background as noise while doing something else.<br><br>Why do you think that even after watching a dub they are still clueless and constantly ask retarded questions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They can't actually tell the difference between good voice acting and bad. I know because I was one long ago, you just don't think critically about anything at that age.</br></br>  Because I will tolerate bad voice acting if it means I don't have to play ping-pong with my eyes between the words and the show.  <br><br>I'm just very picky with dubs. I'll watch GitS, FMA, Hellsing OVAs, Eva, Spice and Wolf. Thats it really...</br></br>  <br>your eyes can handle it, they were built for it</br>  <br>I'd still prefer not to if a good of even less than decent dub exists. There are shows that I can not watch dubbed tho.</br>  They are reading off a script. A lot of dubs are just cold readings, without any time to rehearse.  <br>Gonna that take adderall regularly m8</br>   Muh feeble eyes cant keep darting back and forth and READING <br><br>Such a retarded excuse. I used to have closed captioning on when i used to watch tv.<br><br>This is probably the reason why foreign armies speak english in movies than to keep authenticity.</br></br></br></br>   tfw watched Akira dubbed <br> tfw watched Cowboy Bebop dubbed <br> tfw watched FLCL dubbed <br> tfw watched both GiTS dubbed <br> tfw watched PASWG dubbed <br> tfw watched the Rebuilds dubbed <br> tfw watched Soul Eater dubbed <br> tfw watched Summer Wars dubbed <br> tfw watched Disappearance of Haruhi dubbed <br> tfw watched SAO dubbed <br> tfw watched Wolf's Rain dubbed <br> tfw only one of these fucking sucked in English </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only one of these <br>SAO?</br></br>  <br>Dubs can turn shit into something worth watching. A lot of the early Manga OVA dubs are so over the top and bad it's hilarious.  Many are better than most of the garbage dubs you see today. </br>  <br><br>Americans can't read, what a shocker.</br></br>  <br>You got it.</br>  <br>I've seen all those dubbed. It's SAO.</br>  <br>Disgusting</br>  <br>Has Bryce Papenbrook ever had a single good role?</br>  <br>It probably didn't help that it sucked no matter what the language either.</br>  <br>I thought he did Blood Lad pretty well</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>No. He's terrible and a good reason why dubs are so awful 99% of the time.</br>  <br><br>They're really trying to push him.</br></br>  <br>He's going to be Emiya Shirou in the UBW dub.</br>  <br>It's the same in Japanese. If you ever listen to Japanese people actually speaking off the street and compare it to anime there's a stark difference.</br>  <br>I think whoever thought he would be a good Eren should be fucking shot.</br>  <br> Bryce Papenbrook is in the anime/game <br> he's always the lead role <br><br>kil me</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the earlier dubs I watched, he was better suited as the pathetic but still courageous hero, not the roles they're putting him in.</br>  <br>It's more clearly articulated and exaggerated, but that's the opposite problem that dubs like the OP is talking about have.</br>  <br> liking dubbed GITS <br> liking dubbed Soul Eater <br> liking dubbed Akira <br><br>You need to die</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm glad I'm not an eleven and would have to endure shit Jap VA's  <br>The problem with dubs is that they are hit or miss<br><br>And very often they are miss. But there are some genuinely good ones out there.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, right? I can't tell the difference between bad Japanese voice acting and good, shit all sounds the same for me.</br>  <br>Denial. Denial is how they deal with it. That and/or ignorance. The reason Disney's are generally the best dubs available is due entirely to them hiring actual actors as opposed to acting industry rejects. Literally, the entire American English anime voice acting industry is full of people who started in either radio or theater, and when voicing local radio proved to be a retarded deadend job (shocker) and when the steep competition of having to actually act to be a successful actor proved too demanding, they turned to whatever job they could get to help keep the income flowing. No, not "voice acting" that was filled by standup comedians transitioning into film and TV gigs. The tiny desperate struggling anime localization projects who barely had enough money to cover their repackaging and translator fees were the ones who would actually hire them. Then even when that industry sort of took off (then crashed, then sort of took off again) the scene was small enough for the companies to stick to the model they started with, which was under paying their actors, effectively keeping their budget to a minimum while ensuring no real talent would ever be desperate enough to stoop so low as to accept the subpar wage.<br><br>The one exception is of course, Disney, because John Lasetter's pet project rainday penny jar is bigger than the entirety of the American anime market.</br></br></br>  <br>When did I say anything about "liking" them? SAO's the only really exceptionally bad one. Also the 1989 Akira dub is the one that sucks dongs. 2001 is better.</br>  <br>I don't think you even understand the nature of the problem. No one's complaining about "realism" in the acting, it's about "appropriateness" as is always the case with acting. There's nothing inherently bad about exaggerated or cartoonish acting, but it has a time and place. Also you've stupidly ignored a huge chunk of quality films in your generalization prompting the ceremonial<br> maybe if everything you watched wasn't shit... <br>reply.</br></br></br>   he doesn't speak Japanese <br><br>The nips are more enthusiastic, but let's not get ahead of ourselves<br><br>I'd say 40% sound ridiculous</br></br></br></br>  <br> he didn't like dubbed GITS <br>anon plz, thats one of the few decent ones.</br></br>  I mean, dubs are one thing, but dubs by Sentai Filmworks are a true crime against humanity.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=69n<wbr>yEcQ112o</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Emn<wbr>cf4kP_m0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EmE<wbr>ESOXQJso</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N5-<wbr>9i8lOqEY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Japanese anime voice acting industry has convinced its viewers that its cutesy and highly exaggerated acting is worth paying for and obsessing over. So much so that they have classes dedicated to it.</br>  <br>It's not just enthusiasm. Japanese has a really different intonation. Amateur voice actors don't understand that trying to emulate the delivery of original Japanese voice actors is dumb, so we get really flat sounding intonation with shitty pitch control.</br>   dubfags <br>Do those even exist</br>  <br>Look outside of /a/ for once.</br>  <br>Dear god no, that's a terrible idea.</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Em<wbr>ncf4kP_m0</wbr>  [ ] <br>Thanks god I never watch dubs, this is terrible.</br></br>  <br>I've often heard it said that the problem with modern anime is that it's produced and enjoyed mostly by people who dislike other people.<br><br>Much like how a poor drawing is not drawn from life, but from ANOTHER picture.<br><br>Shitty VAs sound like caricatures of human beings. The end result is fucking retarded.<br><br>They don't speak like human beings and the result is awkward and jarring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep<br><br>There are dubs in languages other than English, you know. Latin American dubs at least try by getting voice actors that already had considerable experience in their field (it helps that a lot of them don't limit themselves to anime, they do voice work for spanish dubs of western movies, TV shows, etc)</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. There are, in fact, people who refuse to watch anime until they are dubbed in English.</br>  <br><br><br>The hell are you going on about? There are dubfags IN HERE right now.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Holy shit, TL;DR, autism-kun.</br></br>  <br>I prefer dubs over subs if I like the sound of the characters.

Surely, if you're a "big" enough fan to buy an English dub of an anime (either from funimation or a retail store), you most likely already have watched some anime on the internet in Japanese via Crunchyroll. Would companies like Funimation and Sentai really lose that much profit if they decided to stop dubbing and simply localize/distribute everything but their largest of shows? Even if they did lose sales, wouldn't it be counterbalanced by the reduced costs of localization?</br>  <br> Hey have you heard of this underrated show Another??? <br> MUST SEE ANIME MOVIES: It's all Miyazaki with like one Shinkai <br> anyone know where I can watch this show dubbed? legally please! <br>Never again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aniplex really wants to shove her in everything too.</br>  <br>I'd imagine they've run the numbers on this, as they've been doing it for decades. It's profitable, to be sure.</br>  <br>Truly the worst kind of people.</br>  why does anyone give a shit if someone watches dub or sub. watching either one supports the already faltering industry  <br> le pepe images must all be deleted, no exceptions!  <br><br>I hate these new janitors to be honest.</br></br></br>  <br> I watched the dub for Another, it was ok. </br>   MC is played by Todd Haberkorn   <br>I seriously don't understand how you can claim to be a big fan of something as relatively niche as anime and refuse to watch it subbed. It's fucking mind boggling.</br>  <br>I don't believe you.</br>  <br>He's outdated. Bryce is the new Todd.</br>  I accidentally watched some of Monster dubbed because I couldn't get the subs working on my tablet, what do anons think of it? I didn't mind it aside from Johan's airy girly voice, but then I watched subbed later and he sounded exactly the same in Japanese.  <br>It is not possible to post a meme and not be shitposting at the same time.</br>  <br>You have Dubs and dubs.<br><br>Dubs are done well enough to be called "good" by a majority of poeple that actually like anime (See: no one on /a/). Anime that fall under this category are most movies, ghost in the shell, cowboy bebop, and space dandy.<br><br>Then there are dubs which are so bad you realize within the first five lines that its a quick attempt at a few bucks from newfags that want what they think is a hottest newest anime. Shows that fall under this category are shows like Master of Martial Hearts, every single dubbed hentai, Railgun, and anything done by funimation between 2003 and 2014.<br><br>Anime watcher tend to come in three types, subs only, subs and dubs, and weeaboo. What generally happens is a person will start as a weeaboo, then eventually go subs-only because they believe its the purest form to watch an anime in. Then they, or at least most, eventually grow up and realize that they can like anything they want when they remember that no one elses opinion matters. Most of a/ watches subs and dubs, but subs-only is the status quo as a general filter to keep newfags from coming in and asking stupid questions about shows that are airing in their country several months or years after everyone else watched them.<br><br>Most dubs are bad, not because japanese voice acting is good, but because when you watch a show in japanese first, you set what the voices should sound like, then when you watch the dub the voices dont sound the same, so you default to "its bad". There are plenty of dubs that are bad in their own right, like Railguns, which anyone with more than 100 shows under their belt would notice right away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There are good dubs and good dub actors, the problem is that they are generally more inconsistent in quality of voice acting and casting than the Japanese.  <br>Yeah, the general level of voice work in anime is a disgrace compared to regular films. Even if you compare cartoons to cartoons, in ancient looney tunes a one man Mel Blanc show was as far away from anime dubs as Broadway is from elementary school plays.<br><br><br>The worst is when there's a song in English and I end up reading the English subtitles anyway.<br><br><br>I don't see a need for it aside from shows that will air on broadcast TV.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From a buyer's perspective, what's the point in buying it if you already watched it subbed on a simulcast stream? Unless it comes with something extra and/or in the extremely rare case that it's good enough to rewatch subbed in non-streamshit quality, why bother?</br>  <br>How retarded do you have to be for this to be a legitimate problem?<br>Shit excuse, subs are always superior.</br></br>  <br>Perfect, I just love it when my cute little girls sound like soul-drained hags who've given up on life.</br>  <br>Raildex dub wasn't bad until Kuroko showed up.</br>  <br>They should all be deleted.

It's the translation of "Onee-sama" as "sissy" that kills it. Saten and Uiharu sound like 40 year olds</br>  <br><br>my unpopular opinion is that I actually like kuroko more in the dub. <br>I'm not baiting, I'm not trolling. I think its a really good performance.</br></br></br>  To be honest, I think most contemporary dubs these days have reached a certain level of quality control that there's nothing really bad to say about them other than "well yeah it exists".<br><br>This isn't the 90s or early 2000s anymore.</br></br>  <br>Kuroko without the old hag rasp isn't good.</br>  <br>But it was though</br>  <br> old hag rasp <br> crazy preteen lesbian </br></br>  I think the big problems with dubs is that they always mix the dub too loud, and it always sounds like the voice is coming from a recording booth rather than the environment the character is in. <br><br>The second big problem is that the cadence of the speech is slightly wrong as they try to fit English into the Japanese length of character speech. <br><br>Dubs are shit, and dub actors are terrible at their jobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why bother buying it in the first place if you have access to that simulcast stream? I know Funimation offers both the Dub and Sub on it's website, so it doesn't make sense that a person would buy the blu-ray to watch the English dub when they already can watch (and support) it on Funimation.</br>  <br>Because some people like physical memorabilia.</br>  <br>Bryce is the new Johnny. You barely hear Johnny in anything anymore.</br>  <br>I am new to animu, and I always demand subtitles when I watch a new series. However, once I've watched it once, if I go back to it, I will often seek out the dubbed version just so I can compare them. I was actually pretty butthurt when I couldn't find a dubbed version of Nichijou, even though I am militantly pro-subs.</br>  <br> my tablet <br>PLEASE tell me it's a Kindle.</br></br>  <br>ironic</br>  <br>There are actually people who hold a "no dub, no buy" mentality when it comes to anime on disc. I don't know if it holds true for all series or just the really popular ones.</br>  <br>When so much of the average anime fan's experiences consist of watching anime for free on the Internet, it's certainly nice to have the option if you buy it. Especially if there's a dubbed version on the Internet somewhere.</br>   not watching dubs   <br>What leap of logic did they make to think that oneesama meant sissy?</br>  <br>I hate when they use honorifics in dubs.</br>   Every aggressive adult female is voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard <br> Every cocky bad guy is Scott Mcneil <br> Every male MC is either Vic Mignogna or Johnny Young bosch <br><br>Why does funimation keep using the same fucking actors</br></br></br></br>  <br>I always wondered why they don't just leave the honorifics or their English translations out in dubs. English dosen't have them, and hearing characters say "brother", "big bro", etc. just sound unnatural.</br>  <br>the fucking jojo dub, why</br>  <br> He didn't like dubbed Soul Eater <br><br>All the voices were pretty much spot on except for maybe Patty.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=648<wbr>0V-5GDos</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They really use honorifics in dubs?<br>Isn't that weird?<br><br>I thought dubs would be completely localized.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>faggot.</br></br></br>  I liked dubs that take on the life on its own. That it practically offers a similar yet different experience.<br><br>A good example would be Yoru ga Kuru ~Square of the Moon~. The original Japanese is a plain VN to H-OVA quickie adaptation. But, the English dub was a campy B-movie with porn which have some funny jokes that is absent from the original.  There's this one H-scene where the MC feels that something's not right. The English dub has the MC comment that he might be gay .</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish, they use to be but some use honorifics still. It just sounds so unnatural.  Azumanga dub and Persona 3/4 come to mind </br>  <br>Similar to Ghost Stories?</br>  I prefer Dub over subs only because I like to watch anime while laying in bad before I go to sleep and if I'm watching sub i need to wear my glasses because I'm blind as fuck.  <br> I used to have closed captioning on when i used to watch tv. <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>This only happens for series nobody otherwise gives a crap about. It's not like VAs and scriptwriters can just dick around all day long and expect to bring any profit.</br>  <br>script/10</br>  <br>Yup<br>Same person argued with me that the PS4 version of Elders Scrolls Online was somehow better.<br>You're paying 60$ for a free game, you can use a controller on the PC. I can't see an argument.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be the extreme end but yeah.<br><br><br>I only expect the dubs to make the show feel like it's already set in the dubbed language. No forced equivalent for honorifics (just use "Umi" for "Umi-chan" and not "Umi-ster"), no out-of-place Japanese (no students call each other "Sempai"), etc. Also, put some effort in localizing the jokes. I don't need a TL note for a dub.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably has a shitty PC.</br>  <br>It's because they haven't tried sub enough. I used to be a dubfag then had an anime I wanted to watch enough I watched it sub, I struggle because retardedly slow reader who constant pause. But there are some good dubs and a lot of shit dubs that make you want to cut out your eardrums with a scalpel through your nose. <br>Some dubs I liked was sao, spice and wolf, high school dxd, mayo chiki, haganai, heavens lost property, my bride is a mermaid. If you want a laughable dub try watching chaos head dubbed, the English sub and audio is so off from each other it fucks the story.</br></br>  <br>i wish funimation licensed everything</br>  <br>I feel the same way.</br>  <br>They practically do these days.</br>  <br> no students call each other "Sempai" <br>Makes me wonder how Burgerplex/Bang Zoom is gonna handle UBW and HF. The old DEEN F/SN dub just kept it as is.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Sentai grabs a lot of crap too. They're the dubfags' worst nightmare.</br>  <br><br>But I'm in this thread!</br></br>  <br> No Game No Life <br><br>I actually like those voices especially Shiro, i'll go kill myself.</br></br></br>  <br>In that case I wish sentai got all the releases.</br>   Michael McConnohie   <br>Why?</br>  <br>It's a she, and not really?<br><br>That being said, Space Dandy Dub was pretty great, only really "disliked" (as in it wasn't amazing) QT's role. Some of the English episodes were better than the sub, some were on par... Some of the songs were better in English.</br></br></br>  <br>but they dont have cool boxes and box sets like funimation does</br>  <br>They're that stupid that they can't handle looking at more than one point of the screen at a time.</br>  I've come to the assumption that dubfags don't even like anime. If you actually liked it, you would at least have seen a number of shows subbed before/if they were ever dubbed in the first place.  Can someone link me to a dub that is considered objectively "good"? <br><br>There hasn't been a single dub I've heard that hasn't made me physically cringe, and I'm trying to figure out if it's just me.</br></br>  <br>Fuck funimation.</br>  I love /a/ culture  <br>there hasnt been an anime that hasnt made me physically cringe, especially not your favorite anime</br>  <br>I would have been fine with "Big Sis", but sissy just sounds horrible</br>  <br>but thats sentai filmworks. you can tell by hoa horrible it is</br>  <br>Cowboy Bebop, Big O, GitS:SAC, Outlaw Star, some of the 90s and older Gundams, etc. Early Bleach was pretty good too.<br><br>Most of the older toonami shit is decent. The new stuff has been dogshit lately.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;tfw don't even notice I'm reading the subs anymore <br><br>I always fucking read this shit before I'm about to watch something, and then I'm suddenly super conscious of the text and can't concentrate on the video.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nLm<wbr>sVBgZiak</wbr>  [ ] <br>here you go :^)</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RVR<wbr>OU28Q1_w</wbr>  [ ]<br>video is shit<br>it's ight otherwise.</br></br></br>   i actually think the Welcome to the NHK dub is better than the sub. the english VA's really gave it their all. <br> same with Bebop </br>  <br>that dub is brilliant though</br>  Personally, while I'm still a subfag. I've grown an appreciation toward some american dubs. Even if they are only somewhat decent. I think it's because the dubs in my country is so horrendous, and voiced by the same 5 terrible 'actors' over and over again.  <br>That's Sentai bud. Funimation is alright every once in a blue moon.</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Em<wbr>ncf4kP_m0</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br>Sora's English VA was actually not shit even though he's completely new. If the dub had a little better direction and editing he would've been really fucking good. That's saying a lot compared to "I'm Typecasted As Every LN MC" Matsuoka.</br>  I used to think dubs were bad just because the VAs had to manage to match the flapping but it's more than that.<br>There has never been a dub with vocal intonation matching that of other media such as films or theater. What people pass for good such as Cowboy Bebop, GITS, Baccano<br>dear Jeebus if you heard that stuff accompanied with live action you'd be killing yourself.<br>I'm not saying I don't like those dubs but we just have to acknowledge that the standard 'good' for dubs will always be fucking shit.<br>Maybe it's the director, or indeed the annoying lip flap matching, but it's probably just the VA fucking it up once in a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br> objectively <br> good <br> That shit <br>Would you stop forcing this meme? It's not dank at all.</br></br></br></br>  Of all things, Genshiken had a legit good dub which I prefer over the jap  <br> forcing a meme <br> as far as dubs go it's generally considered breddy gud <br>I don't know what to tell you<br>here's your response.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the baccano and bebop dubs would do just fine in live action</br>  <br>I don't have to like it nor the show itself if I don't want to you know. So stop forcing me onto your taste.</br>  <br> ask for recommendations/other peoples' thoughts  <br> cry bitch tears and act like you've been raped <br>ayy</br></br></br>  <br>In general, the Japanese don't actually animate to pre recorded voices. They just have generic lip flaps that move arbitrarily whenever someone is saying something with the occasional specific line.</br>  <br>Even though Nozaki-kun was not only the objectively better comedy but the objectively better anime of that season? No one fucking cares anymore.</br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>that guy is a retard anyways. lets just giggle at him and humiliate him while he sulks in a corner</br>  <br>Why is it that in every one of these threads the Dandyfags have to come out and force their stupid shitty show as if anyone even cares? Just do the world of favor and drink a gallon of bleach.</br>  <br>Dubs generally sound bad because when you hear the original Japanese voices you associate a character with that voice. The voice becomes part of that character. So when you hear the dub voice it sounds bad partially because the dub voice is not part associated with that character.</br>  <br>If every single dub you've heard made you physically cringe, then what non-cringeworthy English work are you comparing them to?</br>  Posting in a /co/ thread  <br>In live action, if an actor or actress knows they fucked up, they'd probably stop of their own volition<br> that was a reaaaaaally bad take. <br>Now, because there are moments of utter shit in dubs, even if the vast majority of the voice time is okay or good, too much shit and it wouldn't pass for live action.<br>I admit, Baccano is the one show I have seen with the most consistency - so many characters who are solid most of the time.<br>But fucking Nice's accent is grating on the ears. Maybe that's the VAs native accent, I don't know. Regardless, it was a bad decision.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't get that way with languages that I do not speak.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128099734 <br>I never said that you fucking idiot. I'm saying that I want you to just fall off the face of the planet already because you already did enough damage by shitposting in every single thread for every single show that season because everybody just had to care about your piece of shit.</br>   Really like Ayumu's dubbed voice <br> Look up his VA <br> Sort of a newcomer who hasn't been given much work <br><br>This shit kills me<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GPA<wbr>GeRGZr90</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your show fucking sucked then and it sucks now and it always will, so just fuck off.</br>    <br>That's all you can do is post stupid reaction images. You have no real rebuttal besides that because you already know.</br>  <br>I enjoyed it<br><br>literally opinions/10<br>It's not a debate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Think they had him do the MC of D-Frag and Ben-to if you want more of him.</br>  <br>He fits the roles he gets.<br><br>Except Accelerator.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, he's amazing. i also love how they did the dub for that anime, because besides the OP and ED, they re-did all the songs, and all the jokes too, so it's a different experience from the sub</br>  Yea, it seems the sub is always superior. I used to think there were dubs that at least rivaled the subs (Sean Schemmel as Goku, or FLCL) but was won over by the originals eventually.  <br>He's also Shoe from Guilty Crown and he's going to be Kaneki.</br>  <br>Ahem</br>  <br>This is how it should be if some things are too japanese.</br>  The worst part about dubs is the translator always feels the need to change or censor shit way more than with subs. Happens with video games too. The original audio is necessary if for no other reason than to keep the translators honest.  <br> literally the dub's script, put into subtitles <br><br>i don't think that'll fly, doc. a translation is a translation</br></br></br>  <br>That's one of the reasons why I think I prefer watching Steins;Gate dubbed. It really doubles down on the banter and the atmosphere changes slightly, but I think I prefer Tatum's take on the show than the original Japanese audio.<br> Word to your mother. </br></br>   tfw I started watching the Durarara!!! dub because I was still high off of how good the Baccano!! dub was <br><br> mfw too deep into the marathon to turn back and start over <br><br> That Isaac and Miria cameo </br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the most random anime they've ever gotten. They could afford to add their own flair to the dub because not much would be lost in the process.</br>  <br>durarara's dub is pretty good. i don't see what you're going on about</br>  <br>too bad Durarara isn't.  Baccano isn't very good either. </br>  <br>in the commentary they said they had to improvise and change a lot of things because a lot of the jokes were puns that would not translate, or pop culture references literally nobody would get</br>  <br><br>DRRR was literally just Baccano for fujos.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit this, in fact sometimes I'll look down at my phone because it's such a natural thing now and realize I didn't understand what the fuck they just said, because I didn't read it.</br>  <br>And dubs are consistently a lot more liberal with their translations. I'm not talking about localization either, dubs will erase any subtext they find offensive or ship characters or turn conversations that weren't jokes into jokes, etc.</br>  <br>wanna get hurt?</br>  <br>Like how in Pokemon I heard that the dub put a lot of Misty liking Ash subtext in when there wasn't in the original?</br>  Maybe I'm alone in this, but I kind of like the broadcast dub thing Funi is doing. The dubs are all of varying quality, but it extends the amount of enjoyment I get out of a show. I can watch it in Japanese first and then watch the dub as it comes out. If it's bad then I can just make fun of it, but if the dub is good like with Assassination Classroom or Kekkai Sensen, I get an entirely different and unique experience.  <br>that's 4kids</br>  <br> Changed Seraphim's pet name for Ayumu ''piece of shit'' to ''maggot'' <br><br>Not sure if they did this because of voice matching issues or they were afraid of negative feedback.</br></br></br>  <br>A dub transcribed into subtitles is for people with hearing problems.<br><br>A typical subtitle script used directly as the dub script is not only awkward due to literal translation bias, but also inconsistent with the duration of the character's animated dialogue.</br></br></br>  <br>There is literally nothing wrong with broadcast dubs.<br><br>It's living proof of the T E C H N O L O G Y our society has today.</br></br></br>  <br><br> talking shit about Baccano <br><br> I understand why people wouldn't like it. I enjoyed it but it was definitely a love-or-hate anime </br></br></br></br>  <br>More than likely it just had to do with lip flaps. "Maggot" in English goes by a lot quicker than "piece of shit."</br>  <br>in my opinion, maggot sounds more comical, and funimation doesn't like using profanity unless the anime is really dark, like deadman wonderland.<br><br>i'd take maggot over piece of shit because the show isn't about driving some guy to depression</br></br></br>  <br>IIRC there's a scene in the dub where they almost call him a  faggot  because it rhymes with maggot. So maybe it was another "lost in translation" thing?</br>  <br>I can understand why people like it but it just wasn't for me.</br>  <br>Yes they sound much less elegant. It's like that for all languages, in my opinion.</br>  <br>I have a feeling that broadcast dubs cost FUNi no extra time or money, but that the real reason their standard dubs are so delayed is because the Nips don't want them releasing dual audio BDs so soon.</br>  <br> tfw Monica Rial has such varying degrees of good and bad  <br>i don't even know what to think.</br></br>  Only dun I've ever legitlly enjoyed was<br>GTO</br>  <br> There is literally nothing wrong with broadcast dubs <br><br>The concept is great. I really enjoy them. But I'll be the first to admit that some of them are kinda shit. Seraph, an already middling show, had a lot of miscasts and just downright bad acting. There were a few standout performances, but it's just a really odd dub.<br><br>Then you get shows like Yuri Kuma and Otaku Teacher, which are arguably just better left alone and the dubs for them are just bizarre. Not bad, but nutty.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think she does cute voices pretty well but that's just me.  Speaking of her https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pWS<wbr>rSudcpRU</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br>She's pretty much the go-to for loli vampires.</br>  <br> tfw never a monogatari dub <br><br>i would miss hearing kamiya and hana and everyone anyways</br></br></br>  <br>I got pretty floored when I learned she voiced  Michiko in Michiko to Hatchin. </br>  <br>They've come out and said that it doesn't cost any extra time or money. But the reason the BDs are delayed are because: <br>1.) They're using the tv broadcast tapes and there are usually changes between broadcast and BD release. <br>2.) The production committees don't want reverse importing because it's becoming a major problem, as the price for BDs in Moonland is ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br><br>okay that sounds reasonable</br></br>  <br>Well that was just pure speculation on my part. Glad to see that it's actually the case. I didn't want them sacrificing quality for speed.</br>  <br><br>you're precious jap va's do that too tard</br></br>  <br>Does FUNi have a seperate crop of VA's for the broadcast and non-broadcast? They just dubbed Noragami and the cast is mostly veterans.</br>  <br>How is it?</br>  <br><br>these kids don't remember the dark days. although those manga entertainment commercials were bad ass</br></br>  <br> eyes were built </br>  <br>It is literally impossible to dub Monogatari with all of those Japanese puns.</br>  <br>No idea. When they did the broadcast dub of DxD BorN, they switched out the MC for some reason, yet they were able to restore the cast of Haruhi. I don't know what goes into these decisions.</br>  <br>Yato's voice is pretty weird, but everyone else is decent.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uOj<wbr>CKI2RXoM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> yet they were able to restore the cast of Haruhi <br>Gotta give em credit on that one. What a fuckin miracle.</br></br>  <br>Broadcast dubs are new, so it's hard to say. There are still a few shows in Funi's catalog that aired a few seasons ago that need to be dubbed and released, because they aired before broadcast dubs became a thing.<br><br>That being said, there are a lot of reoccuring actors in the broadcast dubs. Ian Sinclair, Monica Rial, Chris Sabat, Sonny Strait, and Aaron Dismuke are all popping up a lot. However, so are a lot of new voice actors. A lot of the people in these broadcast dubs are rookies in the field, only having prior experience in local theater, as do most of the Funimation regulars. <br><br>Broadcast dubs for sequels, spinoffs, or new seasons usually get the old cast back (with the exception of High School DxD, where two actors had to be replaced), even if they aren't Funi regulars, so again, it's hard to say. I know Nagato Yuki-chan was outsourced to Bang Zoom in LA instead of being recorded in house or by Okatron in Dallas.<br><br>Right now, Funi is still trying to figure out how to best go about broadcast dubs, so there's occasionally going to be odd casting throughout seasons or lots of reoccurring actors, but they're probably going to get better at it as time goes on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what the deal is with the girl who got recast, but I do know that the guy who voiced the main character is battling with some type of cancer and a general rough patch after a nasty divorce. <br><br>All the Haruhi VAs are LA regulars, so it probably wasn't harder than just outsourcing it to Bang Zoom. Kind of like what they did with Ocean up in Canada when they dubbed Roberta's Blood Trail.</br></br></br>  Reminder that the casting in the dub of Spice and Wolf for Lawrence is objectively better than in the Jap version, and Holo is possibly better depending on the viewer's taste.  The best part about broadcast dubs is seeing /a/'s reactions to all the voices.  Has someone compiled a list of watchable, modern dubs?<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/QEV0E2EAePo?t=705  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Depends on your criteria.<br><br>My list is simple: almost anything not licensed by Sentai Filmworks.</br></br></br>  <br> Dubbed Akira <br>TETSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></br></br>  <br>has sentai filmworks ever done a good dub?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J4C<wbr>OLV6CleU</wbr>  [ ]<br>It's a classic</br></br>  <br>CANADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>Sure.

That cute, high-pitched way of speaking doesn't work in English. Dubs a shit.  <br>I remember watching this shit in VHS dubbed.</br>  <br>elfen lied? whenever i think ADV i think elfen lied. the dub wasn't bad, but i have this one dvd case of it that was pretty big, like a VHS tape box, but had no extras and had all 3 disks stacked on one disk holder. it's weird, but it's the best looking release of the show there is</br>  <br> Bang Zoom <br>If they were able to restore the cast for Haruhi, why couldn't they do it for ufotable's UBW? They fucking mangled the original cast, which was consistent for DEEN's TV and movie releases, save for Saber.</br></br>  <br>does he have down syndrome?</br>  <br>Azumanga (even though Japanese is still better)<br>Ghost Stories<br>Evangelion<br>RahXephon<br>Those are the first 4 I think off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow.<br><br>I'm actually impressed. Too bad literally every other VA is horrendous. I hope this chick gets more (and better) roles though. Sugu is a low bar.</br></br></br>  萌え is impossible in English. That's why I almost never watch English dubs.  <br>She was also Kyuubey in Madoka, Amy in Gargantia, and Taiga in Toradora.</br>  <br>in english please?</br>  I watched Nagi no Asukara dubbed because I had never watched anime dubbed; it was decent  <br>You still watched SAO tho</br>  <br> not liking the Ranma dub <br><br>Shit I first watched it as an adult in the 2000s and I still think it's enjoyable.

Aniplex of America has first dibs on the Uforable stuff because the Japanese branch is part of the production committee.

I don't know who has the final say in the casting decisions, but unless the VAs themselves have an excuse, whoever didn't want to restore the original cast must be fucking delusional or so new that they don't even know about the other dubs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> RahXephon <br>this dub confuses me. it's like, there are some good performances sprinkled through it, but then there are some really terrible ones. and then the guy who plays the lead, you can tell he's trying really hard to be good but he just falls flat, which is strange because he was really good in NHK and Soul Eater.</br></br>    <br>I prefer the Japanese. There is no better Reika than Maaya Sakamoto.</br>  <br> Speaks completely fluent English <br> I really think my English is improving! </br></br>  <br><br>The only exception I can think of is Space Dandy</br></br>   still watching dubs <br> still watching low-budget production voice actors too untalented to join a union and make a living that doesn't require following animu conventions like a rodeo clown <br> still watching an adaptation with a script so far off-base that it gets its own set of close captions because it doesn't count as a translation anymore <br> still doing anything that encourages non-literacy and wasting money on a dub when VIRTUALLY NO ANIME AIRS ON MURRICAN TV ANYMORE <br>There is no reason to still watch dubs.<br>Email Funimation and whoever else is stupid enough to still be making dubs that you will not buy a physical copy of any media containing an English voice track, as you could be paying less money and waiting less time for it were there no dub.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i always love this stuff</br>  <br>And Aldnoah.Zero.<br>And Bleach.<br>And Busou Renkin.<br>And Kanokon.<br>And Noein.<br>And Vampire Knight.<br>Ignorant faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did you even read the thread?</br>  <br>I think you're in the wrong part of town, man</br>  <br>obviously, the sub can't be beat.</br>  <br><br>I'm convinced that when Sentai decides to dub something that they've licensed, they literally go around their office asking their employees "So, who wants to do the voices in this?"</br></br>  <br>An actual nigger voices Nyanta.</br>  <br>yeah, and he was in some halo thing too</br>  <br>I was convinced that they were gonna do a shitty British accent to try and sound classy.</br>  <br>To be fair, it's not like black guys are all that common in anime. I'm pretty sure they'd give him any voice he could fill. I didn't watch the LH dub (though the clip earlier with Akatsuki's dub voice was off-putting), but the bits I hear with Yami Nyanta sound alright to me.</br>  <br>the black guy they used has a really smooth voice</br>  <br><br>I can't stand Kuroko the character, but Kuroko the dub voice was good.</br></br>  <br>The only two of these acceptable to watch dubbed are Bebop and PSG, the former because of how iconic it is and the latter because it fits the western style of the show better. The FLCL dub is passable, but there's no reason to not watch it in its original Japanese. In fact, even if a dub is extremely good, unless there's some special circumstance or factor that makes it notable you should always watch any media in as original a form as possible, meaning that you should be watching subs 99.9% of the time, in anime, live-action movies, anything.</br>  <br><br> Who would voice Yui in the Yahari dub? </br></br>  <br>Isn't the guy who did the voice for Jet black?</br>  <br>hey man, i totally agree. but that doesn't mean that there aren't still good dubs. it's nice to appreciate a show in both formats, but again only if its a good dub.</br>  <br>No, Jet Black was Beau Billingslea. Nyanta was a guy by the name of Jovan Jackson.</br>  <br>Half the joke of PSG is that it's a western-styled anime. The other half is VAs shouting FUCK.<br><br>Why would you even?</br></br></br>  I thought Gungrave had a decent dub.<br> the dub ending actually made me cry for some reason. </br>  <br>It's hilarious how a post that actually uses common sense gets ignored.<br><br>Truly, /a/ has ascended autism.</br></br></br>   I liked the KMB, Cromartie high, Haruhi, and PaSwG dubs <br>Usually it seems that dubs have zero effort put into them, they're not even reading from a script, they sound like they got shoved into doing the job and they want to go home then die a miserable death.<br>It's so terrible and depressing.</br></br>  <br> liking the KMB dub <br>i can defend the others but i can't defend that.</br></br>  <br>Eh, they sounded like their characters at the very least, at the bare minimum level.<br>And out of the many other dubs that have people bubbling out their lines with the gusto of a fax machine, it's the slightest step above.</br></br>  <br>Haruhi was decent all around save for Mikuru. She does serve as an example as to why the high-pitched girl voice doesn't work right in English. Her character as a whole was annoying and shitty anyway. We did however get based Freeman voicing Kyon to a crisp.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128103831 <br>I'd take excessive swearing and camp over the latter.</br>  <br>is Freeman the only consistently great dub VA? no matter how bad a dub is he always manages to salvage it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128103831 <br> excessive pop culture references <br>This is legitimately acceptable when the original joke is a Japanese pop culture reference that simply does not translate. If there's an acceptable alternative the intended audience will get, it's okay to use it. I have no idea why you'd prefer to hear a joke you wouldn't understand.</br></br>  I watch subbed shows during the day. I watch dubbed shows at night when I'm too tired to read shit. I'll watch a show dubbed after I've watched it subbed just to hear the whole story again in English. <br><br>Aniplex usually does a good job, but that's because they can afford to continuously use Bang Zoom, and because of that their blu rays cost a small fortune compared to Sentai and Funi. <br><br>Sentai only seems like they dub about a third of what they license. Most of their VAs are literally whos, and the only decent ones are the couple that are shared from Funimation. I'm butthurt as hell that they've licensed a lot of shows that I like, and now I'm expecting a bad dub, if they even choose to dub them. <br><br>Funimation has the best in house dubs. I like most of who they use in their dubs.<br><br>tl;dr: I watch both. I like both. I have opinions, now go ahead and shit all over them because this is /a/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What I think of when I hear his name<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=95m<wbr>wIi8lVHQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128104422 <br>What's an example of proper localization?</br>  <br>Pop culture reference are fucking garbage and date a product. You should never have them in your translation.</br>  <br>Any Mario game.<br><br> Because there's nothing to ruin. </br></br></br>  <br>The dub is even more vulgar and over-the-top, which I like for that one specific case (they do the same thing to a lesser degree in the KlK dub and I hate it), however the lack of FACK FACK FACK and the rolled r's in RRRRUUUUUURRRRRRUUUUUS does miss some of the charm of the original.</br>  The Panty and Stocking dub was fun and gave me the giggles.  <br>Panty's VA was the best.<br> You look like Mick Jagger's grandpa </br></br>  <br>Blood Lad got dubbed?</br>  <br><br><br>FLCL was good.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm on an even higher level. <br><br>One time I accidentally started watching an anime raw and it was about 5 minutes in before I realized there were no subs and I didn't understand most of what they were saying. <br><br>I recently went a whole episode of a show ignoring the fact that there were no subs cause I read the manga and knew what was going on.<br><br>I only understand a few words and phrases in moon (probably only as much as your average /a/non)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how that show would handle getting a dub. I bet it would be horrible.</br>  Subs are way more consistent. Subs are usually decent enough (though I think part of that is the inability to understand the language, so it sounds better than it really is), but dubs can very enormously in quality. A perfect dub is objectively better than a perfect sub, but most of them aren't perfect. A good number are shit and most have at least one character who just sounds wrong. Using subs is a safer bet, and once you get acclimated to subs you stick with what you know.<br><br>Also there's definitely a draw to listen to the original audio, regardless of quality.</br></br>  <br>I don't think there's even a single scriptwriter in the business that would know of or care about any of the references.</br>  The thing I don't get is that, why even watch a dub in the first place?<br>Dubs come out slower or not at all for most anime and very rarely are they better or on par with the original cast.<br>There are so many factors that must align for it to even feel worth it, so why do you do it?<br><br>I'd rather not gamble on a dub when I can watch a sub and get consistent quality with well known actors that are given roles they know they fit.<br><br>Not to mention that hearing English in something you know was originally Japanese is extremely jarring.<br>I used to watch dubs when I was a little shit until I realized how off everything sounded when I knew what the original language was supposed to be.<br><br>Disney dubs in Swedish made me hate dubs in general.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why was the Dub for this so fucking good? It's arguably the best, and if not, considered one of the best Dubs ever produced.  Voices like the teacher in Index and Goemon from Oda Nobuna, how would a dub even come close to those voices?  <br>Anime hasn't been niche for over a decade anon.</br>  <br>Johnny's still in everything, he's just side character instead of MC these days.</br>  I thought Texhnolyze's dub was breddy gud<br> Doc's voice <br>HNNNNNNNNGH</br></br>   This whole fucking thread <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=f_G<wbr>ruNNmbKM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Nothing about Big O was good, unless you are just a giant robot fetishist. <br><br> Except Steve Blum[/spoiler </br></br></br>  <br>In conjunction to being dyslexic they are also literally autistic.</br>  <br>That's the only hentai I've downloaded just for the plot.</br>   mfw I thought the School Rumble dub was pretty good <br> mfw I never once watched it subbed </br>  <br> watching any of those shows dubbed <br>I'm pretty sure ignorance is the heterosexual choice here, faggot</br></br>  <br>School Rumble dub is amazing.</br>   Soul Eater  was ok dubbed right?  I'll watch a dub if it's good because it's way more comfortable not having to read subtitles, even if I am used to them, baccano, FMA brotherhood, cowboy bebop, and a few others have been great dubbed   Am ok and like dubs <br> Like subs too though <br> Have a friend who is absolute dub Jevoahs Witness <br> I LIKE ENGLISH VOICE ACTORS I LIKE THE EMOTIONS MORE YOU CAN'T CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE I WILL WAIT FOR A DUB IF I HAVE TO I WILL WATCH A SUB IF I HAVE TO BUT I DON'T LIKE IT <br>Was tempted to tell him off but I didn't</br></br></br></br>  <br>he might be autistic if he can't tell the emotion coming from a voice just because it's a language he doesn't speak</br>  Alright, /a/.

As a side note, is there any show in english that successfully performed that routine? </br></br>  I've learned that good shows tend to have good dubs while shit shows have shit dubs, so as long as I stick to good anime I don't have to listen to garbage voice acting.<br><br>And don't pretend that the seiyuu are paragons of acting, most of their acting is hammed up beyond reason.

Most professional actors are comparable in skill; an actor succeeding in Hollywood depends on many factors unrelated to acting talent or skill.

Fucking normies. </br>  <br> I'll often watch the dub for a show I missed.

Not once have I met someone, locals or not, who can't tell that English anime VAs are shit tier when compared to Nip VAs.<br><br>Of course there's not to say that there aren't bad nip VAs.<br>On the top of my mind there are that commander from AgK, the sister from denpa kyoushi. But even the worst of nip VAs are comparable with the best of English animu VAs.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of VA talent in western as well, it's definitely not a jap thing when it comes to voice acting. <br>They just aren't working on tiny budget production like localizing chinese cartoons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Valid in some cases but a lot of anime have long static shots.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure you have one of those wasting away diseases where your brain melts.</br>  Fucking muricans  The only dubs you are allowed to talk about are THESE.  <br>I ask myself the same thing about fags who are constantly looking away from what is going on to read subtitles. After about two years of that I had enough and decided to learn Japanese. Seriously fuck having a bunch of the screen obscured by text. English dubs may be fucking terrible most of the time but at least those plebs can watch everything on the screen without any obstruction.</br>  <br>Wait, you've been watching anime for the past 15 years and still haven't bothered to learn Japanese?

I have no problem reading subtitles but the point is it is a distraction. I watch anime to watch it, not read it. I am capable of doing many things at once but that doesn't mean I want to. I can drive a car at the same time as eating a bowl of porridge. Generally speaking I choose not to, in the same way I choose to enjoy the content more by not having subtitles on the screen. <br><br>Answer me this: if you were watching a movie in English and it had subtitles on the screen: would you prefer they remain on screen or be removed?

Sometimes they will also make more differetiation between accents in english dubs like in hellsing. In the end you won't watch as many dubs anyways. Most series don't even have one.

No faggot, it's common courtesy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Are you trying to imply that knowing the names of Japanese seiyuus is a good thing <br>No.<br><br>Being on a dubs thread I only talked about the dubs case. I also don't care about the seiyuus' names.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Akira dubbed <br> FLCL dubbed <br> the Rebuilds dubbed <br> Disappearance of Haruhi dubbed <br> SAO dubbed <br> Soul Eater dubbed <br> Wolf's Rain dubbed <br> good <br>Goddamn, this is why I don't let people on /a/ know there are dubs I like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except the only bad one there is SAO.</br>   MAL <br>nah^<br> ANN <br>nope XD<br> Reddit <br>lol is this 2011?<br><br>no; i cum 2 /a/ for d epic dubbed anime recz:D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Funi shill, Akira and Evangelion are EXCEPTIONALLY bad dubs. All the other ones I mentioned are just bad.</br>  <br>Yore bad.</br>  <br>Have you watched them?<br><br>I used to download dual audios from a sub group that were the only ones at the time that released the shows in 480p, and the dubs were bad, man. (I haven't watched Soul Eater though)</br></br></br>  I don't watch dubs because I'm not voicing any of em.<br><br>And after watching some of those dub youtube clips I really don't want to be the team carry by helping everyone else overcome their shit skills.</br></br>  <br>Except I said SAO was the shit one fuccboi.</br>  <br>And I said your taste was shit</br>  <br>At least Kaji is actually talented when he isn't pigeonholed as the whiny faggot.</br>  <br>The worst thing about watching monster dubbed was trying to figure out what language characters were actually meant to be speaking in some parts. Like they are speaking Japanese but it's supposed to be German but it's English<br>Otherwise I thought the dub was great</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=szd<wbr>S3tt_xy0</wbr>  [ ]<br>I found this in some tread a few days back.</br>  <br>Holy shit.</br>  <br>nips' russian is so much better than their engrish. some sounds almost native, if only not for the soft L's and the lack of a proper ы sound.</br>  The madoka dub wasn't very impressive.  I didn't care to watch it again subbed either   For all the dubfags:  Who are your three favourite VAs?   The only dubs that I would consider bad are all from Sentai  <br>Crispin Freeman, Chuck Huber and Michelle Ruff</br>  <br> watamote dub </br>  <br>I don't need to know japanese to know that.</br>  <br>  not liking based Laura Bailey </br>  Am I the only one that thinks the Code Geass dub was good, if not better than the Japanese version? It just made more sense that the Britannians would, you know, speak English and not the language of the subhumans they conquered. Plus the voice actors like Bosch and Lowenthal were actually pretty good.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eqn<wbr>268e_EVk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I enjoy Brittney Karbowski's voice acting and the one who voiced Sena from Haganai</br>  <br> Code Geass <br>Michael McConnohie's Emperor Charles was great. Big, powerful, and charismatic as he should be.</br></br>  <br>Actually some of the CG staff thought Lelouch was better in english in particular. Something about the Japanese VA being too hammy all the time even when Lelouch was supposed to be more reserved or contemplative.</br>  <br>I think JYB did a good job on him even if he only has two voice modes.</br>  <br> JYB <br> not hammy </br></br>  <br>He is, and Zero is supposed to be. But Lelouch has a few scenes that called for a more reserved performance. JYB was able to deliver on that better than Jun.</br>  <br>Lelouch wasn't even Jun's best role, I think. It was Yuuta.</br>  <br> the one who voiced Sena from Haganai <br>Jad Saxton. She's bretty gud.</br></br>  <br> tfw she still came back for NOT!'s dub despite being roped into triple AAA game role purgatory like Troy Baker <br><br>She's alright.  NOT in general on the other hand is shit. </br></br></br>  <br> someone writes on the internet that they read on some site that in some 2chan thread at some time some people reacted positively to the english dub trailer <br>Turns into:<br> Actually some of the CG staff thought Lelouch was better in english in particular <br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jonny Yong Bosch and Yuri Lowenthal.<br><br>I mean, those are literally all the English voice actors that exist.</br></br></br>  <br>And then there's Crispin Freeman and Vic McPedo, I guess.</br>  <br>This is just like when people claimed that watanabe said that english spike is better than jap. At best, he said that he couldn't understand it, but thought it was good.</br>  Kouen getting NTRd  <br>aww shit Hakuei. You probably have no idea on how much you fucked up.</br>  The haku siblings are Sinbad bitches now   Subject as name <br>OP never learns.</br>    <br>Alibaba feels insignificant.</br>  <br>I can't see how he could change the situation, fighting for Kou? it woudn't make sense</br>  <br>Didn't Hakuryu just kill Alibaba? I smell a unhappy general in Sinbad's army</br>  <br>There should be quite a few unhappy generals in Sinbad's army</br>  Hakuei best onee-san now<br><br>And by betraying Kouen she probably retains her christmas cake status<br><br>It's a win however I look at it</br></br></br></br>  Fucking traitor slut  <br>Nah, Alibaba betrayed them, some of the kings from the SSA don't have a good relationship with the generals either</br>  <br>she's trying to save her Ototo anon</br>  <br>Is shitposting all you can do now, Ren Kouen?</br>  <br>What I mean is, Alibaba isn't like a protagonist. He has very little impact on the story, unlike Aladin.</br>  At this point, can Mu, Ignatus, Nerva and the Fanalis corps equal the equation?  Friendly reminder there is no chapter next week.  <br>Just you wait until Alibaba is elected president of the world.<br><br>Then you will see. You will all see!</br></br></br>  <br>not really, it also doesn't make sense for Reim to side with Kou, they said they wanted to asimilate them in the summit.</br>  <br> Dat sadness <br> He wanted to destroy Kouen with his Edge Bro <br>Aladdin ruins everything.</br></br></br>  <br>Sinbad always neutralises Haku's edge</br>  <br> Siding with the Sasuke </br>  <br>Man, Sinbad looks molester as fuck there.<br><br>I'm happy Hakuei betrayed Kouen, but sad she isn't getting her bitch on.<br><br>Why can't she be more like her mother?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gyokuen will burst out of someone's chest soon enough, anon</br>  <br><br>You are an unfunny guy.</br></br>  <br> implying <br>He went there to talk, Haku just had to make a soap-opera of the situation.</br></br>   Sinbad no bouken OVA 5 comes out today. <br>Hope it gets online soon.</br>  <br>what? Alibaba was Kouen subordinate and said he was going to fight against Sinbad</br>  <br>Because he had no choice. Also Sinbad was being a manioulative dick to fish princess, so I hope he dies hated by all his genrals and with a erectile dysfunction.</br>  <br>Did hatsuyuki translate ova 4?</br>  <br>True, but it doesn't really change him having to fight Hakuryuu. <br><br>Given the choice between having to fight Alibaba right there and having to fight him when backed by an entire army, well, it makes sense Hakuryuu would choose the former.</br></br></br>  <br>oh you are a koufag</br>  <br>No but JnMBS is translating it right now.</br>  <br>I don't particulary care for Kou. To be honest I just like seeing Hakuryu getting fucked and Sinbad denied me of that. Other han that I'm fine with Sindria as a whole.</br>  <br> To be honest I just like seeing Hakuryu getting fucked and Sinbad denied me of that <br>Actually, no, Hakuryuu pride was destroyed thanks to Sinbad.</br></br>  <br>Eh, I will probably wait until all 5 are done and watch them in single sitting.</br>  <br>I always thought that Alibaba would have the become a third force of his own to counter both the SSA and Kou, but who would even join him at this point?</br>  <br>The damned and lost, obviously</br>  <br> but who would even join him at this point? <br><br>America or Europe can join Alibaba.</br></br></br>  <br>Alibaba is going to conquer the Dark Continent, everybody is going to be fuck.</br>  <br> Alibaba <br> Third force <br> Ever <br>He's just be Aladdin's sidekick after Sinbad goes full David and everyone has to team up to stop him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alibaba's soul is unique.<br><br>Everyone else who died has moeblob souls while Alibaba's soul has a clearly defined shape.</br></br></br>  <br>Cactuars can never be leaders anon.<br><br>No matter how much we wish otherwise.</br></br></br>  This is the only recorded instance of NTR that I can appreciate. Didn't expect Hakuei to have the balls to do this.  Can someone explain why Sinbad's backing Hakuryuu up? What does he have to gain from this? I think i'm missing something.  Can someone just up date me on what's happening because I've miss like five chapters and don't feel like going to read them. I just really need to know who's on who team  <br><br>He gets rid of one side of the Kou Empire and the other side is his puppet.</br></br>  <br>Alibaba is a king candidate who's trying to be a nice person for a change. Every other candidate is a type of narcissistic sociopath. Alibaba on the other hand is a sensible person who genuinely wants to help the people to help themselves.<br><br>Just you wait, he's going to revolutionize the world by the end of this manga.</br></br></br>  <br> Just you wait, he's going to revolutionize the world by the end of this manga <br>yes, because he's the MC best friend</br></br>  <br>Alibaba makes the series worst when ever he shows up, I will say him going to a distant planet was the best thing to happen to the series since the creation of Aladdin</br>  <br>Because fuck Kouen.<br><br>In the long and short term, Kouen is way more dangerous than Hakuryuu.<br><br>Especially since Hakuryuu doesn't have Judar anymore. <br><br>With this, he eliminates a guy with three metal vessels and his two brothers who also have metal vessels. Kou is then left with two metal vessels and maybe Kougyokou in addition to having to follow SSA rules, making it way less of a threat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> there are still people reading this manga who don't realize Alibaba is the MC </br>  <br><br>Thanks, that makes a lot of sense.</br></br>  <br> I hate the voice of reason and love mary sues. <br>If there's nobody trying to be sensible then it's not a realistic depiction of politics. It makes sense that Alibaba's methods haven't been effective so far but in the long run if he can stay alive he'll win.</br></br>  <br>Proletariat will rise! Glory to the working man! Down with the kings! Democracy baby!<br><br>Alibaba is the ultimate american communist.</br></br></br>  <br>emm, no, Aladdin is</br>  <br> I don't know what a mary sue is </br>  <br>how is Alibaba the voice of reason? are you trolling?</br>  <br><br> What are dual protagonists? <br>Both Aladdin and Alibaba share the MC role.</br></br></br>  <br>he's the deuteragonist</br>  <br>He never at any point endorsed a democracy. He endorsed a Republic.</br>  <br>No Hakuryuu is the deuteragonist.</br>  <br>Irrelevant details to think after the revolution.</br>  <br>It's not irrelevant at all. They're completely different systems of government.</br>  <br>Democracy is a republican form of goverment, isn't it.</br>  <br>not really</br>  <br>Never actually thought Hakuei would do something like this for her brother.<br>Kouen Koumei BTFO<br><br>I can start liking her now. Thank you based Ohtaka</br></br></br></br>  Sinbad is a douche.  <br>yeah, he should just let Kou invade Sindria</br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3895189482<wbr>?fr=frs<br>chapter is out in ching chong</br></wbr>  <br>Bro alibaba is the voice of beta man everywhere, he cries because he doesn't have a bitch, he gives up his country and then cries for it back, he followed a evil nigga who betrayed because he was beta, he let Prince zuko basically kill him and the list just keeps going on</br>  <br>Delicious catgirl.<br> More spacebros incoming. <br>Fuck yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck the war. Look at them.</br>  <br>I guess the fact that the focus shifted back onto Spacebros means we get what we saw. Kou is gonna get rekt with no sudden surprises</br>  <br>I'm guess that and a Gary Stu is just a character who's just the shit, like he or she is the main character ex:soma from food wars. But aye I could be wrong</br>  <br>No fuck you.</br>  <br><br>Let's agree and fuck Kouha.</br></br>  <br>Please don't bully the cutest Kou!</br>    <br>When I say "fuck Kouha" I mean it in the most gentle and tender way possible.</br>  <br><br>Oh come on another bitch for Sinbad to fuck? Like he didn't have enough.</br></br>  <br><br>What happened to her scar?</br></br>  <br>Ohtaka probably forgot to draw it.</br>  <br>Sinbad healed it with his dick.</br>  <br> Kouensfacewhen </br>  <br>man i want to see his reaction so badly</br>  <br>Broken Hakuei looks delicious.</br>  <br> Can only save people by whoring herself out <br><br>Why didn't she just whore herself out to Arba?</br></br></br>  <br>dat chest</br>  <br> Kouen getting NTRd <br>wut?</br></br>  <br>This actually looks like NTR<br>Based Sinbad</br></br>  <br>Sinbad: What's up<br>Kouen: Huh!!!</br></br>  <br><br><br>You people really don't realize what the roles are in Magi?<br><br>Ok let me explain. <br>When Alibaba and Aladdin are together Alibaba takes 1st place. Why would that be? <br>Because of the simple reason that that is EXACTLY what the place the King is supposed to have. <br>When they are together Aladdin is there to back Alibaba up, the Magi is there to guide and follow the King. <br>You can't tell that much the story clearly takes focus on Alibaba.<br><br>When they go separate ways Alibaba takes a shorter arc focused on him and Aladdin takes the biggest arc and most of the protagonism. Same thing I put up there :It's not much of a difference either but you can tell the story focuses a bit more in Aladdin. <br><br>It's like faggots that hate a character refuse to believe he's important to the story, it's like you blind yourselves because "I don't like this character!!!".<br><br>tl;dr Alibaba takes protagonism when he's with Aladdin and Aladdin takes protagonism when they go separate ways.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Page shows Hakuei going over to Sinbad's side.</br></br>  <br>Because Arba only likes guys she can marry to control their empire before killing them.<br><br>And Hakuryuu who is obviously part of her plan to have the best hate sex ever,</br></br></br>  <br>I like both Kouen and Sinbad (I like Sinbad more) but damn this really feels like NTR and it pisses me off. <br><br>Really Ohtaka? Did Hakuei really have to do that face?<br><br>Now that I think about it, no joke. Is that really Hakuei? She doesn't have the scar in any of the pages posted </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Alibaba takes protagonism when he's with Aladdin <br>not really</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's Yamuraiha in a wig. She's not in the group shot is she?</br>  <br> Really Ohtaka? Did Hakuei really have to do that face? <br>It makes my dick hard so yes.<br><br>All my yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He kind of does though. Obviously Aladdin is more powerful but Alibaba calls all the shots and is the clear leader of their group. Hell, as soon as Alibaba dropped out of the picture Aladdin became depressed and irrelevant.</br>  <br>Ohtaka forgot to draw Kouen's goatee a couple of times</br>  <br>Technically, he does.<br><br>The problem is the Aladdin is noticeably the more successful of the two which makes him look worse. <br><br>Especially when added to the Alibaba suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He does. <br>He takes the lead and he's the one that pushes everyone up. <br><br>Alibaba is Shonen MC that makes everyone "believe" in him. Aladdin is drawn by Alibaba because of this and he states it many times.<br><br>Also just read the fucking manga without Bias</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does Ohtaka hate this Hakuei/Arba of design? They are all sluts holy shit.  <br>I thought this was obvious<br><br>For some reason, a lot of people love either Alibaba or Aladdin, but rarely both, so they tend to ignore the dynamic</br></br></br>  <br>Hakuei hasn't done anything deserving to call her a slut you fuckboi</br>  <br>She is already fucking Sinbad.</br>  <br>No she's not. <br>She wants to fuck Aladdin</br></br>  I think this is the sexiest thing that came out of Magi.<br>This incest felt so wrong but so right at the same time<br><br>Also when is Anime coming back? Next year? the other?</br></br></br>  <br>Anime will come after Sword Art Online Season 4.<br><br>Obviously.<br><br>Also, you have excellent taste.</br></br></br></br></br>   tumblr   <br> She wants to fuck Aladdin <br>Nah that ended when she fucked Kouen. Like mother she is a fucking slut.</br></br>  <br>She didn't fuck Kouen tho</br>  <br>You can't be this dense.</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Kogyoku acting jealous of her onii-sama doesn't mean they were fucking around. It was never even implied, not even once.<br><br>I mean if you're going to post things at least make sure they're canon not your fanfiction.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You guys are okay, you know that.<br><br>That chapter was one of the best of Magi.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Alibaba calls all the shots and is the clear leader of their group <br>tell me, how much aladdin has helped Alibaba to be a king? not much, in fact a couple of chapters ago, people were comparing Judal and Aladdin saying that he was a shit magi and that Alibaba looked more like a follower than Aladdin while it should be the other way around. <br>I think both Aladdin and Alibaba are equals , none of them really leads ,Alibaba is just a more generic MC, he's also older, so people assume he's the leader of the group which i don't think it's the case.</br></br></br>  <br>I was seriously asking if there were news. <br><br>The entire fight was amazing</br></br></br>  <br>You seriously are unable to realize that Alibaba is the one that gets protagonism when they're together? <br>Jesus christ read the fucking manga.<br><br>The fact that Alibaba is not a good king doesn't mean anything. We're talking about the 2 of them here. <br>Aladdin is not doing his part as a Magi well do Alibaba doesn't make his part as a King well either. It's pretty obvious they both need to improve in that sense but that doesn't change the fact that Aladdin follows Alibaba's steps, he himself says so several times</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>None yet sadly. <br><br>As it is now, they probably have enough material for a season, but no announcements yet. Would have been nice if they announced something after the Sinbad OVA was released but no such luck.</br></br></br>  <br> Jesus christ read the fucking manga. <br> When someone doesn't agree with my opinion it means they don't read the manga <br><br>Oh, You are one of those</br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally I hope they don't do a new season until next year.</br>  <br>The 2nd season had some of the worst animation i have seen in recent years.</br>  <br>The first few minutes were pretty cool though.</br>  <br>But what about the giant blue breasts?</br>  <br>By who though?</br>  <br>Nobody because she wasn't with him in the first place. <br><br>This seems live /v/ screaming "cuck cuck" every second.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Sinbad the only one smiling?</br>  <br> Wasn't with him <br><br>Right. And Sinbad's a virgin.</br></br></br>  <br>The same reason why people still like alibaba, nobody knows</br>  <br> Siding with suffering </br>  <br>because he's fucked up in the head</br>  <br>Because Alibaba did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Well yeah...</br>  <br>Because he's a douche and he's about to becoming the leader of most of the world. <br><br>The others are probably more than a little annoyed at having to team up with the guy who killed Alibaba.</br></br></br>  <br>Besides be a super moralsfag, a terrible king candidate and crybaby. Now tell me again how he did nothing wrong</br>  <br>Show me proof that she ever was together with kouen. <br><br>Like I said to the other anon. If you want to post stuff at least provide evidence, not your headcanon</br></br></br>  <br>that's not even the reason why he fell into depravity, nigga had a hard life<br><br><br>Alibaba joined Kou, he might appear in any minute to fight against them<br><br><br>I thought NTR meant "taking away your loved oenes" or something like that, if that's the case, this is indeed NTR</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can someone sink this ship already? I'm tired of having false hope.  <br>No.<br><br>Alibaba will have Morgiana and Kogyoku eots</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because he literally did nothing and still got shat on. It is to imply he does things wrong all the time but because he didn't actually follow through with his actions it is to say he did nothing at all. <br><br> Sinbad stole Fog Troupe from Alibaba and had Cassam loose his trust. <br> Allowed himself to be taken by the darkness and did not want to escape from it.  <br> Lost his authority of main diplomatic contributor of his kingdom by running away after shit went down.  <br> Actually got attacted by fish princess from Kou that wanted to destroy Balabad if negotiations had it her way. <br> Cucked himself when he went for the Mor route but instantly pulled out when a sent of master X servant started to blow. (She still like him though)  <br> Got cucked onna ship when he had a years chance of hitching up with the Coliseum girl. <br> Failed to stop Haku. <br><br>Beta 4 Lyfe</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Believe anon. <br><br>Believe!</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah he may come any minute but then again I could say he could actually become a alpha soon but we know both of these are lies</br>  <br> nigga had a hard life <br><br>Taking care of mother who loves you until she died =/= Being forced to love a person like a mother in an obedient and respectful way or get punished daily.<br><br>Everyone has a breaking point. That is why this Sinbad arc we get Finalist kid as supporting role.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is Sinbad slowly become evil?  <br>dickgoeshere.jpg</br>  <br>Why? It has been proven time and time again that it doesn't matter if they have better chemistry or who's best girl.<br><br>All that matter is the author is a Morgfag and their ship already has the endgame flags raised.</br></br></br>  <br> got fooled not once but twice by the same person <br>  gave a beta answer for why he joined the fit troupe  <br>  cried his ass off because no bitch wanted him and cried mor into a force confession  <br>  hasn't done anything note worthy  <br>  always in Aladdin  <br> after abandoning his throne now cries about wanting it back <br>  for into a marriage and unwanted partnership <br> not just failed to save haku but but lost to him and basically died while only getting some legs  <br><br>The beta is strong in him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek koumei's btfo face</br>  <br> middle east <br> not having more than 1 wife </br></br>  <br>It's like you aren't reading manga at all, Alibaba said he won't have harem like his father.</br>  Oh boy I bet the nips ain't taking this well since most of them ship kouken. And hacked<br><br>This just proves that sinbad the best character in this show. Dude just raking up kou princesses also the Princess from his spinoff</br></br>  <br>Based SinBAD</br>  <br> the episode where they became friends <br>THANK YOU A-1 FOR PUTTING SOME EFFORT INTO IT</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate Aladdin and Alibaba</br>  I hate and love mindbroken Sinbad at the same time. Wat do?  <br>Your kind is the worst</br>  <br>Ohtaka shouldn't have pussied out just because Sheba became her daughteru, she should have stuck to the original plan of making Sheba both Aladdin's mother and the final boss Gyokuen instead of making the meat-puppet Arba into the bad guy</br>  <br> /v/ <br><br>On /co/ they attribute "cuck" to /pol/<br><br>In reality it is a /tv/ meme, it has always been a /tv/ meme</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can, if they join Kouen side, it will get 2 magi, which is a tremendous power.</br>  <br> Not what happened to her mole. <br><br>Such quality</br></br></br>  My fear that Kougyoku’ll end up being the one literally backstabbing Kouen when Sinbad uses her is ever growing.<br><br>I don't think I'm ready for that level of suffering for her.</br></br>  And you made fun of me when I've said that everyone would be on Hakuryuu' side and that Hakuei would betray without being Arba. I also was right that Hakuei was doing negotiations with other countries and that's why she wasn't showing in any Kou meetings. If would have know about it, he would lock Hakei in the basement.  <br>Ohtaka recently forgets to draw it. It's not the first time that happens.</br>  <br>You are going to see Aladdin and Alibaba saving Hakuryuu from Kouen trying to kill him. Judar wouldn't let Kouen to kill Hakuryuu and Alibaba wouldn't let to kill Hakuryuu too. Aladdin wouldn't let to kill Hakuryuu too.</br>  <br> Alibaba joined Kou, he might appear in any minute to fight against them <br>I doubt that he would fight. Alibaba would make a diplomatic choice and save Hakuryuu and Kouen killing each other.</br></br>   early chapters of this manga <br> think its a adventure manga it a little bit of drama, but mostly dungeoneering and fun times <br> it turns full edge, darkness and suffering <br><br>god fucking dammit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kou siblings btfo. Kouen Koumei NTRd kek</br>  I have a feeling that Al-Tharmen might have altered Kouen's body. They supported him.<br><br>When I read the David's passage about true singularity. I get a sense that it's talking about Illah's revival - that reborn Illah is a true singularity. Since no on is pregnant, I think it's magi rebirth.</br></br>  <br>My name is Sinbad, and I hate every single one of you.</br>  <br> she stopped being an ungrateful cunt </br>  <br>It's a fetish not a meme, idiot.</br>  <br> tfw Hakuei can finally be my waifu <br>I've been waiting.</br></br>  <br> hating on best boy <br><br>what are you, a faggot?</br></br></br>  <br>That's really sad.</br>  <br> hating on shota Gary Jesus. <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br> he would lock Hakei in the basement. </br>  <br>  Hakuei was doing negotiations with other countries and that's why she wasn't showing in any Kou meetings. <br><br>Really Best Woman, isn't she?</br></br></br>  is it really a coincidence?  <br>It's a coincidence. Kouen always has a disappearing beard.</br>  <br>Ohtaka has been known to forget important details lots of times.<br>Hakuei hasn't appeared for like a 100 chapters or so. <br><br>Even if we assume it's deliberate, the only explanation is Arbakuei. But then I don't see her stabbing the fuck out of Sinbad who's standing right next to her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least it's not the embarrassing edgy, anon.</br>  <br>Except Judar was so embarrassing edgy Ohtaka herself made fun of him.</br>  <br><br>It's a ruse. Just wait for the reveal and kouen's smug face.</br></br>  <br>His voice was so annying in S1. For some reason he was much more tolerable in S2.</br>  <br>What if KouEn knew about her betrayal and prepared a magical nuke inside Hakuei that would kill everyone within one km so that he gets rid of SimBad?</br>    <br>THE ROSE</br>  <br> I don't know what a Gary sues is </br>  <br>But I know. And It's Gary "Stue" not "Sue".</br>  <br>You obviously don't if you think Aladdin is one.</br>  Whole chapter:<br>http://mh.dmzj.com/magi/40782.shtml<wbr></wbr></br>  M8s, I don't see Alibaba joining the fray at all. Him and Judar will likely return long after the war ends.  <br>same. They may return right after war ends or long after the war ends. Unless Ohtaka wants to make their come back a huge turn off and let them "return in time"</br>  So is this the end of edge master Hakuryuu or will Judar make it in time to turn the tides around?  <br>I mean unless they can get back right this second it looks SSA and Kou are going to wipe each other out. Before it was an assured victory but now it's going to be a long hard fought battle with many casualties.<br><br>Shame Alibaba isn't there. His forces could easily turn the tides of battle one way or the other. He could essential decide the winner of the war if he wanted to.</br></br></br>  <br>  wipe each other out <br><br>Are you retarded? SSA is going to crush Kou.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, maybe if the SSA deployed all of their forces at once they could do it as of right now they're merely forcing Kouen to fight seriously until the last man standing.</br>  <br>I am going with return right at the end of the war but they don't have time to act at all because everything has been decided. Or right after the war. <br><br>I wouldn't mind if they come back after a few weeks/months but we will need flashbacks of what happened during that time if Ohtaka gives them the spotlight of how they returned. If she goes with the war, we will still need flashbacks of how our space duo made its comeback and who won the war etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn I forgot to delete the name, sorry pals.</br>  <br>  Sinbad, Armakan and Mira  <br>  8 Generals and Armakan/Mira assimiliated household members <br><br>Versus <br><br>  Kouen  <br>  2 of his remaining household members <br><br>Tell me again how that isn't incredibly one sided? And I'm being kind here by excluding Hakuei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if this is possible, but count Aladdin at Kouen's side. I still don't find a reason why he would help him, but we should count all possibilites.</br>  <br> Also just read the fucking manga without Bias <br>That's literally impossible.</br></br>  <br> I still don't find a reason why he would help him <br> the most hlarious thing is if that happens the author will try to convince us that he's doing the right thing</br></br>  <br>dat ass</br>  <br>You're an idiot if you think Alibaba is a Mary Sue/Gary Stu. <br><br>He's fucked up so many times and almost every main player in the story looks down on him.</br></br></br>  <br> shit reading comprehension </br>  Jafar looks pissed  <br>Who's the overall strongest of the 8 Generals?</br>  <br>probably Drakon</br>  <br>she even forgot the spot on her face.<br>And that the most important gene in her family</br></br>  <br>Yamraiha is a wildcard with her magic but I guess Drakon is the strongest since he fused with his household vessel</br>  <br>I hope Hakuei meets Hakuryuu, sees his amputated arms and legs, his weary face and how much depravity he's fallen in and feels bad about herself.</br>  <br>Thats his normal serious look, no?</br>  <br>Sharrkan looks like the only one with any kind of facial expression.</br>  <br>Thats because he's feeling uncomfortable he's being watched by his older brother, who he doesn't seem to have a good relationship with.</br>  <br>Drakon, easy choice. Its more interesting to pick who is second.</br>  <br>Well, Alibaba’s household is still there, isn’t it? I don’t think they would willingly join the side that helps Hakuryuu, Olba in particular.<br><br>And then there's Balbadd. Protecting it might become the incentive to enter the war, so Aladdin could follow their lead.</br></br></br>  <br>Arba is coming back and butt raping Sinbad.</br>  <br>Sharrkan got exiled no? I haven't read Sinbad yet, what's their relationship anyway?</br>  <br>Isn't Alibaba's household useless without Alibaba there?</br>  <br>I'd say Masrur.</br>  <br>Pretty much. <br><br>Even with him they are seriously under powered compared to the other households involved.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Jafar is probably the one who's most fed up with Sinbad's crap</br></br>  <br>Don't know, we haven't got to Sharrkan yet</br>  <br>Yeah, he got exiled.<br><br>Well the first thing Armakan said in the manga is where the fuck is my idiot younger brother. That says it all.</br></br></br>  <br>True. I don't see how they can be of much help unless Alibaba attains a decent power-up.</br>  <br> Simbad better not get drunk and naked again and fuck Hakuei </br>  Does Sinbad have a surname?  <br> Sinbad Madaura <br>huehue</br></br>  <br>Oh prophet predict more.</br>  <br>Yes. But I was viewing them more in the line of helping the citizens and stopping ordinary soldiers instead of going after the powerhouses who will be busy with Kouen.<br><br>Or something like that. I just want them to do something and not staying in the sidelines.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean exploit the fact that Kou's military forces are occupied and start winning over the local populace so that they have support when they stage a coup in the weeks after SSA crushes them?</br>  Why can't the sand niggers be at peace even in fiction. Fucking hell there's no oil to fight over in there.  <br>They are if can't if he can't supply rukh. And he's kinda dead so...</br>  <br>What on earth are sand niggers</br>  What will happen to Balbadd if the SSA defeat Kouen? I recall Hakuryuu telling Alibaba he'll enslave and brainwash the citizens with Zagan.  <br>He's not really dead. He's still very much alive and kicking unlike everyone else who just poofs into Rukh.<br><br>It seems death magic is the only thing that isn't capable of killing people.</br></br></br>  <br>How on earth did you get the idea that the kou were based on anything other than imperial china</br>  <br>But he is dead in the physical sense. Though we don't know what's happened to the body yet.</br>  <br> Dat Hakuei face <br>Jesus</br></br>  <br>She is going to be alright once Sinbad's dick is deep inside of her.</br>  <br>It's much better how it is now than whatever bullshit you thought it was.</br>  <br>They probably cremated or buried him. Thought then again maybe them mummified him. I have no clue what the sand people do to heaps of dead human flesh. Hell, maybe they fed him to the vultures so that his death could sustain life or something symbolic.</br>  <br> "Alibaba, Aladdin" <br> Sand everywhere </br></br>  <br>I only tried to even out the war and make Aladdin join by finding a reason that could kinda work but that idea is interesting.<br><br><br>SSA will take over it probably. Hakuryuu can do shit now without Sinbad's consents, so no brainwashing.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm still trying to think how much time have passed since Alibaba's funeral. Even if they didn't bury him yet or cremated him, shouldn't his body already begin to rot? I guess it's impossible for him to return to it now.</br>  <br>Sin Bad.</br>  <br>Oh definitely. At this point not even his organs would be worth harvesting. His body is useless unless they do some magic bullshit to suddenly fix everything.</br>  <br>Maybe he comes back with someone creating a body for him somehow?<br>I'm still hazy on what exactly djinn are, but if they're beings of pure rukh or something maybe he comes back as something similar.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't make sense why she's blushing.<br><br>He disgusted her not too long ago.</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>We're talking about Kou you fucking retard.</br>  <br>All to save her Otouto. Truly, Hakuei knows sacrifice.</br>  <br>I reckon she's a hostage.</br>  <br>Maybe he comes back as a female and gets a harem?</br>  <br>Probably Ugo will.</br>  <br>Not that much of a sacrifice when Simbad eventually beds her.</br>  <br><br> Welcome back Alibaba! I've taken a few liberties in constructing your new body, and you now have compound eyes, a little growth 'down there', and cup holders!" <br>Not that that would ever happen, but I would lose it if it did.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But then how will he give his seed to the Fish Princess?</br></br>  <br>Haven't seen such a long thread for Magi for a while.<br>Good job Ohtaka.</br></br>  <br>Well, shit is finally starting to happen.</br>  <br>SinEi sail</br>  <br><br>True suffering is that Hakuuryuu has the best faces when Magi is going comedy, yet he will never smile again.<br><br><br>Whatever happens I expect there to be a gag of how his new body is incapable or doesn't need reproduction or something and how he's not going to ever get laid.</br></br></br></br></br>  It will not be Alibaba or Judal that turns the war up side down.<br>It will be fucking Gyokuen kek.</br>  <br>Clearly, he would need a donor. The question is though, who?</br>  This is my assumption, but I guess the structure Ohtaka is going with is having the Kou War and Spacebros transition from one to another every few chapters?  Alibaba and Judal in space is like Guts on the board.  Everything because of Sindobaddo!  <br>Why would he need hee to be his hostage when Hakuryuu is already an official member of the SSA and she on her own free will sided with them? <br><br>Why are people trying so hard to make Sin look bad?</br></br></br>  <br>And I'm talking about Magi in general you buffoon.</br>  <br>she was crying</br>  <br> Why are people trying so hard to make Sin look bad? <br>He's doing a pretty good job of that himself.</br></br>  <br>Lets be honest here, there's a side to him that's pure "ruthless politician". Whether or not that's good or bad is up for debate, but it is there.</br>  Will Magi ever get the anime it deserves?  <br>We had one like this just last week.</br>  <br>Accept it she isn't going to end with anyone.</br>  <br>This page still cracks me every time.</br>  <br>sinbad has caused many shitstorms</br>  <br> Hey Alibaba it's me! You're waifu </br>  <br> tfw edgebros arc discussion about Hakuryuu and Sinbad having sex through Alibaba and Kougyoku </br>  Am I a retard for not remembering who all these names are connected to? I've read every chapter, but I had to go check the wiki to know who is who when you guys talk about kouen, hakuei, arba etc.<br><br>I remember Aladdin, Alibaba, Sinbad, Morgiana and some of the more unique names. All these Kou people I forget after every chapter. I feel bad.</br></br>  <br>Not at all. After that year long flashback arc I wouldn't have been surprised if people forgot who Morg was.</br>  <br><br>does someone have the comic that goes with this?<br><br>i think sinbad was possessing her talking to alibaba about sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Morg <br>Who? Some minor character, I bet.</br></br>  <br>Because David.</br>  <br>You're not exactly wrong in saying that. She's nothing more than Alibaba's henchman who provides semi moderate assistance with fights every once in a while.</br>  <br>why is op's hand so small?</br>  <br>Wont happen, but it would be amazing.</br>  <br>Besides the fact that Kouen leads the Kou empire, they're not all that memorable so no, you're not a retard for forgetting their names.</br>  Hakuryuu clearly regrets the things he's done. It'll be fun to see him break down and cry when he realizes that there was no sense of joy or elation in winning his war and he now has nothing to love for.  <br> Love for <br>Live for. Shitty tablet.</br></br>  <br>No he doesn't regret it. He's actually feeling down because he has to rely on Sinbad to get his country back. His pride got shitted on.</br>  so when is ayybaba and Jew comin back 1 or two months after the war or 1 or 2 years  <br>few months I think, but I would prefer few years. That would be a good mindfuck</br>  <br>This. He isn't regretting shit.</br>  <br>After the war, I can tell you that much.</br>  <br><br>would give my left nut for alibaba to come back with hakuryuu ruling balbadd with a deprived older aladdin next to him</br></br>  <br>Wow you couldn't be more wrong if you tried. The fact that it won't be him who kicks and shames Kouen in this war is what's making him depressed.<br><br>The entire mini arc with Belial was supposed to make it clear how he would no longer regret making his enemies suffer no matter who they might be.</br></br></br>  <br>why would Aladdin ever join the killer of his best friend and rule over the land the said friend tried to protect ?</br>  <br>Because he's an impure whore.</br>  <br>i dunno maybe so that he can watch over the people of balbadd in alibabas place</br>  <br>I would wish for this to happen but with Aladdin not on Hakuryuu's side.</br>  <br> Am I a retard for not remembering who all these names are connected to? <br> Kouen <br> Arba <br>Yes you are a retard.</br></br></br></br>  I'm, like, 90% sure that before the year is out, Aladdin will be Sinbad's Magi.  <br>How do you know that was ever the original plan?</br>  Is Sinbad no bouken ova 5 online yet?  <br> deprived older aladdin  <br>absolutely fantastic</br></br>  <br>Aladdin should definitely either be Sinbad's or Hakuryuu's Magi at some point. <br><br>Alibaba should also have a new Magi.</br></br></br>  <br>Everytime I see post like that, I recall this.</br>  <br>Dat blatant foreshadowing.</br>  Will Yunan be someone's Magi?  <br>Magi double NTR?</br>  <br>Yeah.<br>Aladdin NTRs Alibaba with Sinbad<br>Alibaba NTRs Aladdin with Judar<br>Judar NTRs Hakuryuu with Alibaba<br>And Hakuryuu doesn't NTR anybody for maximum suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hakuryuu could marry Morg, that'd work.</br>  <br> And Hakuryuu doesn't NTR anybody for maximum suffering. <br><br>He still has Arba.</br></br></br>  <br>Mor can NTR Alibaba with Hakuryuu. That'd send the fanbase into a frenzy as well.</br>  <br>Arba's dead bro.</br>  <br><br> Mor <br>who?</br></br></br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>This is a fun meme and all, but Mor will get her time to shine when we reach the Dark Continent.</br>  <br>No, not Saki.</br>  Is this actually good or is it just another manga you picked up because you have nothing to do with your life?  <br> Arba's dead bro <br>Literally as dead as Alibaba.</br></br>  <br>read it and find out fgt</br>  <br>I picked it up because I have nothing to do with your mom :')</br>  Post yfw Ayybaba kills Hakuryuu  <br>Good. All according to plan.</br>  <br>As dead as Iwata.</br>  Magi has been really bad since the flashback.  <br>Really? Personally I think it has really picked up the pace recently.</br>  <br>This is b8, but I'll bite:<br> Edgebros <br> Gyokuen vs Hakuryuu/Judar <br> Alibaba/Aladdin vs Hakuryuu/Judar <br> Civil War finally happened <br> Based Sinbad arrives to fuck everything up with his new waifu <br> Spacebros </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aladdin is obviously mantaining his body with FUCKING MAGIC FOR GOD SAKE HE'S A FUCKING MAGI</br>  <br>You fags should stop shitposting so much, it's annoying.</br>  <br> Magi has got much better than ever since the flashback. <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br>  <br>Happens every thread, they are usually accompanied with the "muh dungeon adventures" fags.</br>  <br>he isn't, he refused to do it so Alibaba won't end as Al Thamen dolls.</br>  <br>This. He said to Olba and co that Alibaba wouldn't want to have his body preserved, because there's a chance Al-Thamen could capture and use it.</br>  <br>Feet.</br>  <br>Magi has been on a roll since the flashback.</br>  I can't help but feel as though Magi is rather wasted potential, like all the interesting and fun bits haven't received as much attention as they should have while the less interesting stuff is getting all the focus. Like, this war thing is just kind of boring, the only way it'll become interesting is if Kouen actually wins, but he won't, because Sinbad and Hakuryuu have to remain in the story for Alibaba and Aladdin to defeat later.  <br>Why would Kouen winning be interesting?</br>  <br>No reason, he just doesn't pay attention and doesn't care about anything that happens in the manga, so he wants something that clearly wouldn't have happened.</br>  <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br><br>It would be less predictable, at least. <br><br><br><br>Where the fuck did this salt come from?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unpredictable does't automatically = good.</br>  <br> mindbreak <br> battered <br> fit <br> feet <br> pretty <br> dat ass <br><br>He's like a fucking goldmine.  Not actually into feet, tho </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, but it usually helps keep a story fresh and interesting.</br></br>  <br><br>Actually, post flashback Magi has been fucking unpredictable.<br>No, "Hakuryuu will win" doesn't mean being predicable.</br></br></br>  <br>In some cases, yes. But I don't believe Kouen winning would make the story more interesting. I mean, where would it go from there? What would be the point of Alibaba/Judar coming back if Hakuryuu is already taken care of? And Kouen doesn't have the same Big Bad aura that Sinbad has.</br>  <br><br>Ohtaka is making it seem like ntr on purpose isn't she</br></br>  <br><br>I don't see what hasn't been predictable about the events post flashback? Hakuryuu killed his mom and fell into depravity, which was foreshadowed from the start. Then Hakuryuu beat Alibaba, again something foreshadowed since Hakuryuu was shown to have talent beyond that of Alibaba from the get go. Judar lost to Aladdin before he even learned proper magic, so it's not surprising that he would lose again to him and in a more permanent fashion. <br><br>And of course, Hakuryuu has always hated his half-siblings, so naturally he'll take the throne of Kou and start a civil war to eradicate them. <br><br><br><br>Well that's the question, isn't it? Storytelling is all about "where do things go from here?" While a twist like that seals off some possibilities, it also opens the way for new ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I this from some volume special? I missed this.</br>  <br>Sinbad is more interesting than Kouen</br>  <br> While a twist like that seals off some possibilities, it also opens the way for new ones. <br>Okay. I'm not necessarily dismissing that, but can you give me an example of what interesting possibilities can arise from Kouen winning?</br></br>  <br>he's probably just a koufag</br>  <br> Hakuryuu killed his mom and fell into depravity, which was foreshadowed from the start. <br><br>Of course, killing the boss in that moment, when the other characters were busy with a movie night about how essential fighting togheter that boss would have been, was really predicable. Totally changing the world balance of the series, taking out Al-Quaeda and so Allah from the game for so many arcs, Haku becoming one of the centers of the new balance and basically the new MC, was really predicable as well.<br><br> Hakuryuu killed his mom and fell into depravity, which was foreshadowed from the start. <br><br>Yeah, no. Everybody and their moms expected just litte and useless skirmish as a prologue a war where Aladdin&amp;Co would have been the pacifist heroes as usual, not a fight that was as intense as a final battle, something that took the two main characters and Judar out of the story for the most important climax of this phase of the manga, that would lead to Aladdin getting finally some real developement and doubts, that would introduced some comedy chapters with the space bros arc, and so on.<br><br>  Judar lost to Aladdin before he even learned proper magic, so it's not surprising that he would lose again to him and in a more permanent fashion.  <br><br>Yeah, no. Judar was the strongest magician at that time, it even took a fucking huge asspull, "Solomon's wisdom is literally OMNISCENCE and OMNIPOTENCE" power up to beat him, not even fucking Solomon's magic was enough against him. Thankfully, it was a good idea, and led to many good things.<br><br>And there many, many other things that could be listed.<br><br>You have a really strange idea of "predictable". You don't like it, it's ok, but try to not write something as unreasonable as that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kouen is literally Lenin: Chink Edition.</br>  <br>I'd say he's more Mao Zedong.</br>  <br>and that makes him interesting?, he's by far the less interesting and boring of the three ( the other two being Hakuryuu and Sinbad)</br>  <br>To me he's more interesting than Hakuryuu, but less interesting than Sinbad.</br>  <br>hakuryuu is not interesting but he's entrataining to watch.</br>  <br> and that makes him interesting? <br><br>Not him, but yes, a leader that wants to use his own fucked up communist to make the world a more stable place is more interesting than Sinbad. I liked his way of bullying as well.<br>Haku is literally the driving force of this phase of the manga, so, yeah, he's still the most interesting one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>communism*<br><br>To add something, I think that after Kouen's death and that the whole Kou Empire becomes one of his allies, Sinbad is going to get much more interesting and characterized, though. It's time to see what he really wants to do with so much power.</br></br></br>  Crabs will try to undermine this.  <br>SLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT</br>  <br>I don't get it, why is that cruel?</br>  <br>She has better chemistry with Kaiki. She should've stuck with him in the first place.</br>  <br>It's cruel to Kaiki because she chose the manlet instead.</br>  <br> Stuck with him after destroying her family <br><br>sure thing bud</br></br></br>  <br>still mad your shitty waifu didnt win the rrrg bowl?</br>  <br>This, when they were talking in the cafeteria it seemed like something was off, gave away the vibe of an old couple getting away with seen each other again.</br>  <br>Skee didn't even win the imoutobowl.</br>  <br>Degenerates deserve this treatment.</br>  <br> rrrg bowl <br>Why waifu gatarifags are bunch of cucks?</br></br>  <br> cucks? <br>so there's still no auto ban for this word?</br></br>  <br>Can't ban the truth</br>  <br> Hibikek <br>Why is there still no autoban?</br></br>  <br> kek </br>  <br>There's nothing to undermine if you actually read the books. It's supposed to be a shock to Araragi that her first love was Kaiki, but it's gradually revealed through the story that Kaiki is Araragi from a different timeline. So it's actually that their love for each other is real enough that any version of them will find one another. Like a lot of things though, it wasn't included in any of the adaptations, but that's probably inevetiable, since the books are too elaborate to include close to everything.</br>  <br>Was he just her first love, or did the fuck?</br>  <br>Nah, they just regularly walked home gently some nights.</br>  <br>she just had a crush on him because she thought he could save her.</br>  <br>WHAT A FUCKING SLUT HOW COULD SHE DO THIS TO ARARAGI</br>  <br>Phew. The first reading of OP literally stopped my heart. Then i re-read it and saw it might mean something else.</br>  <br>Are people really this autistic?</br>  <br>I honestly think Senjougahara and Kaiki makes the perfect couple.<br>God Snake arc made it even more apparent.<br>They even made a ending for them so I'm guessing I'm not alone in this.</br></br></br>  You're waifu is cute and I hope you have a nice lifetime together.<br><br>Does your waifu watch anime/read manga? If so, does she have any specific genres she likes?</br></br>  <br>Some lews outfits, like a skin tight dress, japanese swimsuit or  lingerie. <br><br>Goodnight man!<br><br>And now i'm leaving this  amazing  thread.<br>Have a nice evening, everyone!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Leave her be and fret about it.<br><br><br>I have no talents, especially for that sort of thing.<br><br><br>Neater than I would have expected.<br><br><br>I would just like her to wear whatever she feels comfortable in.
