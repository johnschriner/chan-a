Go cry to the liberal trash that wants to protect people from everything.</br></br>  <br>What kind of idiot would think that about a show blatantly meant to be softcore porn?</br>  <br>But my chinese softcore porn!</br>  <br>Then Shingo confirmed for faggot.</br>  <br> Censorship is always a bad thing <br>I used to think the same when I was a horny teen.</br></br>  <br>It's not 暗闇三太 but is pretty good</br>  <br>Why the fuck does the background art look so mismatched with the character models? It looks bad.</br>  <br> detest the ecchi <br>Faggot.</br></br>  I thought it was going to be terrible with the art and aggressive censorship, but it did still make me laugh. I guess I'll keep watching this unless it gets unbearably bad  Gonna watch this shit even if it's censored as fuck need my prison school fix since 1 chapter a week for the manga isn't enough.  <br>and now you're a dumbass adult. Why the fuck would giant white bars across the animation eve, under any circumstance, be a good thing?</br>  <br>Dropped as soon as any filler shows up.</br>  I'm convinced that they don't give a fuck about the anime, they only want to sell the manga.  <br> Why the fuck does the background art look so mismatched with the character models? It looks bad. <br>CGI.</br></br>  <br> The Studio has to buy Airtime <br>I'm not convinced studios have any real revenue. Isn't the budget allocated by their financiers, such as major publishing houses wanting to adapt their product. <br><br>The only time a studio makes money is when they own the IP and then it's though merchandising.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should criticize it then.<br><br>And then you enrolled in the Hitler Jugend.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this you're first anime?</br>  Well atleast they made it easy for me to decide whether to drop this or not.  <br>What'd you expect goyim? Buy the Blurays if you want your precious fanservice.</br>  <br>I don't see a point when the bds are coming. I have to wait to see nipple shots..so what? Nothing we can do about censorship until idiots are purged off the planet.</br>  this is shingo's bitch, right?  <br>Aren't you suppose to make your advertising material good if you want to sell something? Shitty anime will only result in shit manga sales.</br>  <br>Thats kind of the point of an adaptation are you retarded?</br>  Do they overlook her panty shots on purpose?  <br>Yes, why? I just finished streaming it on Funi and I wanted to discuss it with you guys.<br> What I meant is that they don't give a single fuck about the sales of the anime. </br></br>  <br>yes</br>  can someone explain this?  <br><br><br>is it because cameltoe? so it means the studio only had to remove a few lines and everything would've been fucking fine? kill me</br></br></br>  <br>To protect the children from indecency. It also helps the company sell their BDs. I could list more but yeah fuck you for being an idiot</br>  <br>Yea she looks kind of off though</br>  <br>the point is that the animation studio doesn't add the bars - they have absolutely no say in the matter.<br><br>the tv station handles all censoring, this is why you usually have uncensored raws coming from other stations.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off and read it<br><br>There are so many nipple it is fucking insane, there is even a full blown lesbian sex scene showing everything but the vagina</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, just make people interested. It's not like a magazine or even tankobons are expensive.<br><br>No, that's only one point of an adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  Why is Funi doing every anime this season?   there are japanese niggas who pay for cable to see these white laser beams   <br>but they could censor it themselves with some kind of animation trick, anything would've been better than light rays<br><br>so it's their fault</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127883057   <br>I'm watching 11 shows and not a single one is Funi, stop watching garbage shows like this or Gangsta.</br>  It's not like everything about the anime was bad though.<br><br>The comedy was good and the seiyuu were all perfect. I didn't really like Gakuto but I guess it makes sense for him to be like that because he's supposed to be disgusting.</br></br>  <br> gangsta <br> garbage <br>jesus christ /a/ this thread is fucking shameful</br></br></br>  Holy fuck this is bad. VAs (except Kamiyan), pacing, art, censoring, fucking everything. The adaption couldn't be worse. <br><br>Well at least Kamiyan is doing a good job</br></br>  <br>Its entry tier trolling.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> I don't see a point <br>That's your problem. Censoring has always been a cancer.<br><br>For every single one of us to be able to be here one time a penis had to penetrate a vagina and shoot sperm inside of it, why the fuck can't we see a drawn ass in an anime?<br>There is something really wrong about this.</br></br></br></br></br>   added to Plan to Watch <br> tag BD <br><br>See you faggots in six or so months. I'll pick the manga up again after that.<br><br>Waited for Yuushibu BDs and got maximum enjoyment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, noone could do this author's artwork any justice anyway.<br><br>Unless Bones adapted this and went all out with their budget, this was going to be shit no matter who made it.</br></br></br>  <br>VAs are fucking terrible</br>  <br>It's one of the worst shows this year. It's gangsters chopping people in half with katanas while dodging bullets with dubstep blaring. It's "how do we get 14 year olds to watch this?": The anime</br>   Wasn't even hyped for the anime <br> First episodes are usually the best when it comes to animation to hook the audience <br> This was only the first episode <br><br>Good luck J.C. Staff</br></br></br></br>  <br>You really think so?</br>  Never know this may be like terraformars and they may chill with the censorship in the later episodes.  they should just release this and TLR:D as BD instead of airing them  i'm glad they're going with best pairing right away  I'm not even enjoying this but I want to see more of Andre's stupid fucking face  <br> It's "how do we get 14 year olds to watch this?": The anime <br>That would be Prison School</br></br>  <br>Even they know that censoring the main cast would take away too much.</br>  <br>You mean just like the manga...?</br>  the voice actors though<br>was I watching prison school or monogatari?</br>  <br>I'm sorry it doesn't have enough loli schoolgirls for you, anon</br>  <br><br>Wait a minute, this show is pandering to femdom cucks? Absolutely disgusting</br></br>   mfw they spent all their budget on the ass or tits scene   <br> cucks </br>  <br> It's one of the worst shows this year. <br> one episode in <br> not decent <br>I'm not saying its the greatest thing ever, but its more watchable than many of the shows that have come out this season.<br>The source material doesn't try to be "2deep4u", sure, but it is respectable for what it is-an action oriented series</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now it makes sense. They didn't censor Chiyo or Mari, just the mob characters. There's still hope.</br>  <br> 6 chapters adapted in 1 episode <br><br>Bravo JC Staff</br></br></br>  <br> I only watch MANime <br>You've probably unironically watched Jojo as well. No, but Gangsta tries way too hard to be serious. It makes it kind of cringeworthy, it's a very similiar feeling to SAO.</br></br>   mfw Hana voice  <br>At least zetsubou sensei is actively saving this shit from being utterly unwatchable</br>  It can't be worse than Shaft censoring more in the BD  <br> he hasn't read the manga </br>  <br> Mari <br>That should've been Meiko.</br></br>  <br>Gakuto's voice is annoying, Andre too slow, Shingo's voice too deep<br>Jo is alright<br>Kiyoshi is perfect</br></br></br>  Son, ore wa dissappointed desu.<br><br>This show is rekt infested.</br></br>  <br>How can someone shamelessly say that while posting otakubait?<br> I have nothing against Working or loli. </br></br>  <br>Do you realise how dumb you are?</br>  <br>They are not to blame for the censorship itself but for the lazy and obnoxious way they did it.</br>  <br>Why do JC Staff shows always have the most generic voice actors</br>  <br>it will be worth it</br>  <br>Gangsta may be bad but you're the fedora one. Maybe the other guy too, I don't know.</br>  <br> "how do we get 14 year olds to watch this?": <br>Appeal to maturity is the worst argument you can make, especially when you post shows with little girls in them.<br>I liked that episode of Working, by the way, before you try to call me out on being an anti-lolifag.</br></br></br>  It's been a while, angry HanaKana  <br>What?</br>    <br>Not just femdom fags, although Andre antics and VPs sweaty cunt are VERY present throughout the manga(the 'main' part of the series is essentially her talking cooch).<br>There is also pandering to piss fags, ass fags, yurifags, legfags, bondagefags.<br><br>But yeah, its mostly BDSM type shit</br></br></br></br>  Show me your desktop, bitch  <br>Damn I forgot what a horrible Monogatari ripoff that show was</br>  From seeing Prison School's Website it seems it's gonna have 6 Vols which means it's gonna be 1cour. 2 episodes for each Vol. since the first episode covered 5 to 6 chapters they are probably trying to finish up the first arc. This doesn't give me any hope, it might turn out to be a rushfest.<br><br>You might as well read the manga.</br></br>  <br> same studio <br> rip-off <br><br>what the fuck are you smoking</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least it's not Tera Formars.</br>  Digital production and CGI killed anime.<br>This is so soul-less.</br>  <br>I almost forgot how much of a Nisekoi ripoff Monogatari is.</br>  <br>You talk as if those chapters had heavy content.</br>  <br>Gakuto's my favorite character and I'm somewhat disappointed that his voice is so raspy.</br>  <br>It's still a ripoff. Just like Hibike is a ripoff of K-On</br>  This show is pretty hilarious<br>Hope its atleast 2 cours</br>  <br> filler <br> when there's like four cours worth of material </br></br>  <br>point went over your head<br><br>rip-off implies it's by a different studio<br>same studio means its just their style</br></br></br></br>  Am I seeing that properly? Those are dicks, right?  <br><br>It's probably just me but especially with the latest half of the manga I expected Gakuto's voice to be more gentlemanly.</br></br>  <br>It's gonna be 1cour looking at the BD Vols.</br>  what happened to this scene?  Censorship aside, episode was good until the second half. Hopefully they slow things down now that character introductions are out of the way, give everything a little more room to breathe.  <br>So they wont even get to the boys release since thats volume 9?</br>  <br> 2015 <br> still believing the dark ages were a thing <br> applying a euro mindset to fucking japan </br></br></br>  <br>If they try to reach to that arc in 1cour it's gonna be rushed. 9 fucking Vols in 1cour is stupidly idiotic. That would be Tokyo Ghoul all over again.</br>  <br>Except porn got banned in the UK.</br>  <br><br>Joe is packing</br></br>  <br>Not just you. He adresses everyone with dono and is generally the first one to come with a plan when a problem occurs. At the very least I expected a more calculated voice?</br>  <br>No it's not fucking idiot the chapters in the prison school manga are not heavy in content like ghoul. The anime really should end when they get released.</br>  <br> 6 volumes <br>Great,we'll have a shit season finale on top of that<br>Sasuga JC staff</br></br></br>  <br>children shouldn't watch this in the first place. it's the very reason for which rating systems work in order to inform parents to the contents of it all.<br><br>this is just a good example of the incompetence of new parents who instead of actually taking proper care of their children expect it to be done for them and blame tv an games for their inability to educate their children and manage what they see.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Way to ruin the hype.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget small tits. Fucking cowtitsfags spoiling fun for everyone.</br>  I liked it.  <br>BDSM too so this show is banned from the get go.</br>  <br> children shouldn't watch anime  <br><br>Kek.</br></br></br>  <br>Animeonlyfag?</br>  <br> children <br> watching anime at 2am <br>You are retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>So they can sneak dick past censors, but panty glimpses are too much. Nippon is really really gay.</br>  <br>No.</br>  This went from the most hyped anime this season to dead in the water<br>I'll see you when the blurays come out</br>  <br>Yeah the hardons were in the manga too,not as evident though</br>  Despite the story, this series doesn't really pick up until a little ways in, where they trade the hijinks for an actual plot.  <br>If they're doing 6 volumes they are most likely ending when shingo comes and cant open the gate expelling them all.</br>  <br><br>Will Prison School air on AT-X?</br></br>   BGM fucked on another funi rip <br>Seriosuly, again? FUCK funishit.<br><br><br><br>This. It is was 2 cour we would have had the perfect pacing. It felt rushed as fuck, worse than Yamada-kun's adaptation. <br> anons actually trying to defend the pacing by saying it was lax on content <br>Go fucking re-read the manga, the pacing was abhorrent. You don't even get a chance to take in what happened because it's already halfway into the next chapter. The light beams are just the icing on the cake.<br><br><br>BD's won't fix the terribly rushed adaptation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too many exposed legs for tv buy the BD, perv.</br>  <br>i see you haven't learned to read properly yet. it's fine you'll manage one day.<br><br>i didn't mean all anime retard, i meant shows that are clearly not meant for children and could be deemed "improper" for them.</br></br></br>  <br> children not staying up till 2 am to watch cartoons </br>  <br>Holy shit, I didn't even notice that.</br>  Wait, is this really what Kiyoshi says? Is his mom a sumo otaku like Chiyo?  <br>I'm also a manga fag and I enjoyed it, even with all the censoring.<br><br>They are different mediums so it's not going to be translated the same way. However the comedy is still there, so I'll enjoy it. The censoring is annoying as hell though.</br></br></br>  <br>No, hes bullshitting. Hes just glad his mother bought him the eraser because he got to meet a girl with it.</br>  <br><br>Certain types of porn got banned from being PRODUCED in the UK.<br><br><br>You're confusing Australia with the UK.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS</br>   Ok fuck me, I'm stalling on qbt for days. And I got a shit ton of rss setup so I don't want to uninstall, can somebody help me? I know it's offtopic, if you give no shits just ignore me.   <br>Source material is not from the same guy<br>So yes, it is a rip-off</br></br>  <br>This. Also I found the peeping scene to be one of the weaker parts in the manga but they managed to make it funnier. They really fucked up with Hana, though.</br>  <br>They'll probably end it at the end of the first arc, it will just be rushed.</br>  <br>24 episodes would make the pacing slow as fuck if they were gonna end it after the prison break.</br>  <br>This. Episode should have been about the first half of the first volume,ending with them getting imprisoned. Stretching it until Hana clovers fucked the pacing beyond belief.</br>  <br><br>He doesn't say it, he thinks it. His mom likes sumo.</br></br>  <br>Fucking this.</br>  <br>He's talking to himself. I don't remember that line being in the manga.</br>  <br>So you're saying they should have added filler all over the place to introduce the characters? They followed it panel by panel.</br>  <br>No,it was in the manga,I remember it.</br>  Why can they show some pantsu but not others? There were definitely some of cow tits panty shots intact  Holy fuck this was hilarious, The comedy is on point., Gakuto is the most based nigga you'll ever find.<br><br>Starting the manga right now I can't wait any longer.</br></br>   all these niggas getting beaten up by women <br><br>Literally worse anime of 2015.</br></br>  <br>In it's defense, it looks like only the background characters get censored. Hopefully it stays that way.<br><br/></br></br>  <br><br><br>Holy shit dropped<br><br>Fucking dropped. <br><br>dropped with the force of 1000000 suns</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vice President dies</br>  Damn, Gakuto is hot.  <br>Prepare for tiddy</br>  <br>It wasnt. In the manga he first hates thats his mom buys him this sumo shit he thinks will keep her away from him then does a complete 180 when the eraser is what worked.</br>  <br>He looks better with character development.</br>  You guys do realize that the manga is mostly reaction shots and each chapter has very little actual content right?<br>Stop looking at the chapter count and yelling "rushed". It was fine</br>  <br>double picked up</br>    <br>And gets revived</br>  <br>Is she genetically engineered or just the result of superior German breeding?</br>  Fuck you manga faggots, it was great.  <br>She doesn't</br>  <br>totally agree with you anon</br>  <br>Because backgrounds are taken from Google image search, and all modern anime is disgusting CGI.</br>  how can the manga be so much better than the anime, gee whiz<br><br>vp best girl and most fappable</br></br>  <br>Kiyoshi dies</br>  Garbage anime.<br><br> hurr b-but COMEDY <br><br>What are you? A retarded 12 years old kid? Is this shallow "comedy" possible able to entertain you? Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  the adaptation is bad compared to the manga, it always is.<br>but I am sure this series is a blast for those animeonly.</br>  <br>Filtered not censored<br><br>If you mess with your contrast you can see the nipples just fine</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> newfags replying to att whore tripfag </br></br></br>  <br>That line definitely was in the manga (bottom right balloon). Though it probably was translated like shit so you didn't notice.</br>  <br>But it did end on the first half of the first volume you fucking moron. They were imprisoned in chapter 3.</br>     mfw my friend is finally gonna read this shit after seeing the episode  <br><br>Thanks for the excessive censoring japan.</br></br>  <br>How can people watch utter fucking horse crap like this?<br><br>Fucking 5 seconds into the show the art style, horribly blurred drawing, voice acting, and the basic attitude/speech of the characters is yelling THIS IS CHEAP WORTHLESS CRAP STOP WATCHING IMMEDIATELY and if I give it 10 more seconds my whole body begins to cringe.<br><br>Skim through the ep in 20 seconds, maybe watch some select scenes, and it's just full of the absolute cheapest, most garbage, trash, worthless kind of fan service you could ever find in an anime.<br><br>How the fuck can you watch this and not have to almost LITERALLY vomit?<br><br>For fuck's sake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>This shallow attempt at trolling seems to entertain you so that speaks volumes about your retardation.</br>  Wow they censored so much that they even put a bleep when he said fuck<br>I'm pretty sure the time this comes on their is no need to bleep out words like fuck</br>  <br><br><br>Jesus, Prison School threads are gonna be awful.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't give a shit about that, I'm ok with it actually, but, is there an ''alpha'' in the series? Or everyone is a beta fag? Because this ''I love getting hit by women'' thing is just so annoying, there are no series that do the opposite.<br><br>A friend told me that the director is a pretty cool guy, is he different from the other faggots?</br></br></br>  <br>Because not all of us are allergic to fun or basic bitch prudes</br>  <br> posts Mirai Nikki <br>You're trolling, aren't you?</br></br>  <br><br>There is an alpha. Won't spoil more though.</br></br>  Should I just read the manga or is the anime good?  <br>All of the men 'level-up' throughout the story, it's pretty great.</br>  <br>Read the fucking manga<br>The anime is rushing the jokes.</br></br>  <br>Elitist Manga fags will carrying on just acting all retarded.</br>  <br>You dont even need to read past the 4 first words of his post to know hes a shit tier troll.</br>  <br>I want Tien shopped into every flare censor now.</br>  <br><br>That's sounds great, then I'll just read the manga, because the censorship is terrible. Thanks guys.</br></br>  <br>Stop lying and just say the anime is censored so he should read the manga.</br>  <br>Not suffering from autism helps.</br>  <br>Well what do you expect? Monogatari was complete shit too. You rip-off shit, you still get shit.</br>  <br> not unironically watchign Jojo and enjoying the shit out of it, and then waiting for the comfines of Part 4 <br><br>your life must be sad</br></br></br>  <br><br>Extremely valid reasons. <br><br>Anime status: dropped<br>Manga status: picked up<br><br>Thanks guys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You read a manga at your own pace though. It's not like you have a timer to read each page, so how can you talk about "rushing jokes"?<br>The anime is just moving fast, it's not like it's rushing anything.</br></br></br>  <br>What is this mean? Is it about the VAs?</br>  I wonder what ANN will say about this show  I will continue to watch it because I like the manga.  <br>MAL score is 8.00</br>  <br>yes it is sherlock</br>  I don't understand how the ecchi genre can exist if there are censors.<br><br>I can understand censoring fanservice but censoring the entire point of the show? What the hell.</br></br>  <br><br>Do they start dominating the women though? I hope not, I only want to read this for the femdom, and I hate when it gets reversed</br></br>  <br>I won't care about the censorship until the second arc which won't be animated.<br><br><br>The transitions between scenes are awkward and the pacing too fast, it doesn't let you savor a good joke before moving to an entirely different scene</br></br></br></br>  Rushed as fuck.  <br>Very briefly, and only for the sake of pissong them off so they dom the boys even HARDER later on.</br>  <br>Great, picked the fuck up</br>  Are some of you faggots trying to defend this adaption. I know you love the manga but that shouldn't blind you on the big flaws this adaption has so far. The pacing is going too fast and doesn't give enough of a breather for the jokes. The animation looks below average and the background art mismatches with the character models. The censorship is bad though that can wait till the BD release.<br><br>Before you say muh it's still hilarious and that this is a different medium so it's alright. Then that's a really poor argument because the different medium doesn't mean the anime needs to be rushed or for the animation to look mediocre. This is coming from the person who enjoys the manga.<br><br> Animeonlyfags saying manga elitist <br><br>You guys can fuck off because this isn't being elitist but just providing the flaws the anime has so far. The anime isn't shit but it's meh/average so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He becomes one. Kind of.</br>  <br>fuck off elitist</br>  <br>It's the lipstick. Honestly while I was fine with most of it she is supposed to be a tomboy, fuck lipstick.</br>  I enjoyed it, I'm not watching it for fan-service and I never read manga. Deal with it nerds.  <br> Alpha  <br><br> Getting pissed on <br><br> Breaking down mentally after. </br></br></br></br></br>  Guess I'll avoid these threads for a while.  <br>Kiyoshi takes it up in the ass by Gakuto</br>  <br>He has alpha moments and reverts into a huge pussy beta. Im sure eventually he'll go full alpha its building up like that and starting to show.</br>  Look, anon, all the girls of the school are looking down on you!<br>How do you feel?</br>    <br>Pacing seems fine to me but whatever i guess.</br>  Did you guys truly expect any better?  Aaaand dropped. Guess I gotta wait for the BD rips. Fuck you Japan.   Expecting the land of pixelated pornography to not censor things <br>You fags set yourselves up for disappointment, you know.</br>  <br>Great. Now we have to deal with this fucking sludge of a person.</br>    That shit felt more like a brief summary of manga rather than proper adaptation. Thet bathroom scene was supposed to be on-the-edge comedy with close calls and Kyoushi's autistic inner monologues, Meiko's character was basically glossed ever and quickly replaced by Hana who should've appeared by ep 3 at earliest. Animation is shit and stupid vapor/lightbeam censoring looks retarded  <br>  should've appeared by ep 3  <br>So 1 chapter per episode? Are you retarded?</br></br>  Assman and the way he<br>talks<br><br>Is it<br>good?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, maybe the end of ep 2. <br>Hana appears in ch.5 which is actually ch.6 considering that pilot chapter is double-length.</br></br>  Anyone have a link to some 2ch Prison School thread? I want to see how the 11's react to the first ep.  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pre<wbr>view-guide/2015/summer/prison-schoo<wbr>l/.89903</wbr></wbr>  Can we just talk about how the OP is the literal GOAT for a second?  <br> Meiko's character was basically glossed over <br>good<br><br> and quickly replaced by Hana <br>also good</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hana "appears" in chapter 3, she isnt properly introduced if thats what you mean till 5 which the anime did exactly as it was in the manga.</br>  <br><br>Bets on this getting a second season.</br></br>  <br>No you fag. The first half of the volume is up to the end of chapter 3. The first 3 chapters are longer than the others.</br>  I hope you people aren't only interested in this because of the deliberately ridiculous lewd shots.  <br>When did that happen? And what series? Seems interesting for people who are not fags.</br>  What the fuck is wrong with this guy?  <br>did you stop watching at that exact moment</br>  <br>That's exactly how the manga goes.<br><br>It being animated and still being that fast reminds me of Gyagu Manga Biyori.</br></br></br>  <br>I just mean what's up with his anatomy.</br>  <br>Someone post dinodre</br>  <br>And they followed all of it as it was. Are you suggesting filler?</br>  <br>It wouldn't have such a huge following if it was just fanservice like a gorillion other series.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127887616 <br>Shit. misclick.</br>  What the fuck is a "tamale"?  <br>Mostly everything.</br>  <br><br>Yesss. Exactly the kind of outraged impression I tought it would get. Couldn't have asked for anything better really.</br></br>  <br>Mexican food?</br>  <br>he's undisputed best boy and the only one who's currently together with a loyal waifu.<br>otherboyfags can go fuck themselves, which is all they can, apparently</br></br>  so, in order for the last, tiny glimmer of hope that I have to get destroyed, allowing me to easily wait for bds with my conscience clear, when will we be certain that at-x will be full of solarbeams too? when does it air on at-x?  <br>No he isnt. Its one sided as fuck and hes brainwashed.</br>  The fuck? This was way too fast.  <br>f/z has brought some wonderful new posters here  :) </br>  <br>I'm into that.</br>    <br> 1436544626730.jpg <br>08/10 would bang</br></br>  <br> it's one sided <br>if it were one sided, it would be from risa's side. she's clearly into him.<br>he's the only one from the boys who managed to a) get a girl to like him and b) get said girl to treat him as he wants<br>he's far more successful than the rest of the male cast.</br></br></br></br>  Huh? You came already? Do you want to get killed?  <br><br>Dipshits, that's how fast the manga went. Not to mention it's comedy, it's imitating the Gag Manga Biyori anime's style.</br></br>  I honestly do not get how some of you can say this is a perfect adaptation. <br><br>Animation and censors aside, did nothing seem off at all? I feel like a lot of what makes prison school feel like prison school just wasn't there.</br></br>  <br>Holy fucking shit. Who do these people think they are to take anime that seriously? That shit may be the most pretentious thing I've read in a long time.</br>  <br>because all they managed in their lives it to become bloggers that review anime. if reviewing anime isn't a serious thing, then they didn't manage anything serious in their lives.<br>it's a defense mechanism.</br></br>  So fucking rushed.  The tone is fine, the pacing was fast but they had a lot to get out of the way in the first episode. I liked the voices and the OP and ED are fine. My biggest problem is not even with the animation, which could do with some improvements, it's the fucking color scheme they went with. It fucks up most scenes. <br><br>It was an alright first ep, here hoping it improves when it gets to the best early moments.</br></br>  FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKK<br>Now I'm angry.</br>  <br>Yeah i aint gonna read that<br>But i saw that the female reviewer gave it a 1.5 rating, the lowest.<br><br>What does that tell us?</br></br></br></br>  <br>the good thing is that the episodes should have less censoring as we go on. <br><br>The scene where Kiyoshi and Hana duke it out in the room alone shouldn't be censored much, and yet it's still lewd as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>He recovered from that.</br>  <br>And that was because he only gives a shit about meiko and risa trying to be something shes not to appease that. He never actually intended to get risa to like him just like kiyoshi never intended to get hana to be crazy about him. Risa only treats andre the way he wants because thats the way he likes meiko to do it.</br>  <br>It could have been slower and get more episodes, yeah.<br><br>Animation\art argument is meh. It was impossible to have art as good as the manga.<br><br>On the other hand good voice acting gives the whole thing a new dimension that you can't get from manga.</br></br></br></br></br>   censoring oantsu <br><br>why</br></br>   Funi <br><br>Is any other group going to pick this? I'll even take commie.</br></br>  <br>So now instead of one joke of a reviewer per show they have a handful of them? Linking to that shithole should be banable offense.</br>  <br> nick creamer </br>  Why the fuck would you censor cartoons? This is what you fuckers get for supporting shit like crunchyroll and fucknimation  <br>This shit is going to far.</br>  <br>the ??? was also a woman.<br><br><br>Why the hell would they have 4 people write reviews within a few hours of airing, feature them all on the same page, and have every single one of them recap the premise for at least one of their 4-5 paragraphs?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking feminist shit.</br>  <br> The scene where Kiyoshi and Hana duke it out in the room alone shouldn't be censored much <br><br>Do you mean the kiss? How are they even getting that far if someone said they are only doing 6 volumes?</br></br></br>  <br> PrisonSchool_c167_-_p09_Utopia.png<wbr></wbr> <br><br>His face and haircut is the bottom of a dick</br></br></br>  <br>we understood things differently then. imo, risa was originally weirded out by the s/m stuff, but she grew into it.<br>and even if we ignore that, while both kiyoshi and andre didn't intend to make hana and risa like them, respectively, andre managed to get risa to express her "liking him" in a way he enjoys, unlike kiyoshi who's still getting pushed around by hana.</br></br>  <br><br>That's their anime season preview thing, each writer writes about whatever show he feels like to let readers know what to expect from the first ep. Too bad their tastes are fucking awful.</br></br>  why do people care about the censoring? just go read the manga for the good art.  <br>3/5<br>2/5<br>1.5/5<br>???/5<br><br>Well they seem to all have different opinions.<br>And wow, even the person who didn't like it criticized the censorship.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> why do the people care about seeing ecchi stuff in an ecchi anime </br>  The fuck? You guys told me in the manga threads this isn't an echhi shit show, and now everyone is dropping it because they can't see their precious ecchi?<br><br>Hypocritical much?</br></br>  <br>Why the fuck are women watching this shit?</br>  Why are the armies of the Empire's tributaries so proud to fight at the command of the Empire that they are desperate to be the vanguard? They enjoy being under the Imperial thumb and paying tribute?  Im getting Generation Kill vibes from this  <br>Being the vanguard means getting to the action first, means getting the best opportunity to win glory and fame and renown. It's not about the good of their country, it's about personal reputation. Feudal nobles love war.</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  They had a culture of honor. Something foreign in today's era unless you're east asian.<br> only japan has a genuine culture of honor <br> china has a culture of nationalism <br> korea has a culture of shame </br></br></br>  <br>She is strong like a bull for her size</br>   mfw they keep changing character designs   <br>More like sucking up is the best way to be promoted.</br>  I'm surprised they learned the language fast enough to draw these chicken scratches, but I'm more surprised they bothered to write the Japanese translation under the sign.  <br>They should had written the warnings in english too, just to be sure</br>  <br><br>The anime messed up her build. She's a 5' manlet (?) with quite a rack.</br></br>  <br>How much time did exactly pass since the gate was first opened?</br>  <br>Not even close as good or cathartic, there has to be magic and a campaign complete with a story. A good Company of Heroes - GATE edition if you will.</br>  <br> not latin <br>The sign should have read "Catapultam habeo. Nisi pecuniam omnem mihi dabis, ad caput tuum saxum immane mittam"</br></br>  <br><br>IIRC the invasions are a month or more apart. They had plenty of prisoners and time.</br></br>  <br>At least 3 months plus a week or so to build fortifications and tunnels.</br>  <br>I was afraid they would go with the route of the natives speaking Japanese and never acknowledging it</br>  <br>3 months</br>  Man, that was like playing a RTS in easy.   roman niggers invade Japan, slaughtering civilians, including children, without warning or mercy <br> JSDF retaliates, only killing armed soldiers who attacked and continue to attack them <br> /a/ will defend the former <br><br>Are you this butthurt your anime fantasy land got btfo?</br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/jivskrfyrh.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br> just to be sure <br>You make it sound as if the area is administered under UN. <br><br>US-Japan security treaty did not get invoked in the story btw.</br></br></br></br>  <br> plebs play Civ 5 </br>  <br> They should had written the warnings in english too <br>Why?

And the outcome is obvious.</br></br>  Is the novel translation ongoing? Or should I just read the manga instead?  <br>The tension in OPM comes from "how long can everyone else hold out until OPM arrives"</br>  <br>it's more about politic than war itself, read the manga</br>  <br>You dumb mother fucker, how are they to dig trenches and fortifications when they are under heavy fire and are within range of 105mm howitzers? Shut up</br>  <br>zero. it's been said noriko has no more family left on earth or something</br>   you will never go on patrol in fantasy land while singing your favorite op with your bros <br>Why even live.</br>  <br> I too don't see much point of the battle. <br>Actually this battle was VERY important. The Emperor sacrificed the forces of the Vassal States to prevent them from rebelling, but that has long term consequences.</br></br>  <br>It's a very deliberate attempt to parallel the 2nd Gulf War, but with dust mudhut desertland replaced with verdant european fantasy kingdoms, and smelly muslims replaced with elves and catgirls.<br><br>It's largely a political series juggling the personal story of a soldier and his company seeing things firsthand as occupying 'liberators', and a larger picture of the geopolitics of a technologically and culturally less developed nation being forcefully initiated into the 21st century by an occupying military, while also being plundered for its valuable resources in a geopolitical power struggle.</br></br></br>  <br> short chicks will never be around to tell you off for singing our favorite op <br>You don't even need to be in the military for that.</br></br>  <br>much appreciated</br>  <br>Its a medieval fantasy world meeting modern.<br>If you aren't getting kicks out of that and still need some super saiyan sharingan aizen villain to kill, you should just stop watching this.</br></br>   Their vehicles are current <br> Their weapons are old <br> Supposedly in case they have to be left behind <br><br>In that case, surely it should be the other way round? Their personal arms and armour should be current, but they should be travelling in old shit that they can leave behind?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Join the SDF today and make your dream come true!

Walking?</br>  <br>That one guy in the center of your picture<br><br>There's no kill like overkill</br></br></br>  <br>"The empire played us like a damn fiddle!"</br>  <br> not shooting corpse just to be sure </br>  <br> Stannis Baratheon.jpeg </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cYr<wbr>h5h9acg8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>In the manga the armies actually pointed out that JSDF were digging holes in a mocking manner.<br>Doesn't look like they cared much for trenches even though their world is filled with magic and arrows so long range battles should be even more important.</br></br>  <br>They were pretty far away shooting at targets only occasionally illuminated by flares.<br>Probably just firing until the cease fire order is given.</br></br>  How is this nigga planning to deal with the SDF? Surely he doesn't plan on conventional medieval combat. Or will the SDF do something stupid like spread themselves too thin because of &gt;budget?  <br>Not even the dead can know peace from this patriotism.</br>  <br>Abandoning your vehicles would be last resort, since they constitute your primary means of retreat.<br><br>If you run out of ammo, or it becomes inoperable, you can abandon your gun without much consequence. If you're fleeing for your life, it's desirable to abandon the dead weight even though it might be fixable if you carried it back with you.</br></br></br>  <br>They are suppressing the darkness.</br>  <br>yes<br><br>perfect</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>watch helplessly.</br>  <br>Diplomacy through her daughter, Alnus was the last real battle fought between JSDF and the Empire</br>  Holy shit just send some guys there under flag of truce to "establish a dialogue" and find out more about them then. Once they come home with their report then you'll know more.  <br>Not-Saddam thinks he'll block their advance by scorching all of the earth between the gate and the city, thus preventing them from resupplying on the march and forcing them to spread their supply line too thin to siege.<br><br>He doesn't realize his enemy moves around using technology he's never, ever heard of. When they demonstrate that the scorched earth tactics don't really have any affect, he bends over backwards for the JSDF and sues for diplomacy.</br></br></br>  <br>They can drive the old shit back.<br><br><br>But in an emergency at the base, you are not going to spend time collecting vehicles if you need to retreat back through the gate, you're going to haul your ass outta there with just your gun and helmet. Surely your personal protection is far more important than some vehicle you sign out of a pool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic was shit before modern science (high elves excluded) and trench are useless when you can just send dragons who resist arrows.<br>In CQC battles the one with higherground wins. They could use them to slow down cavalry , that is if the land dragons they have can't just jump over them. And they don't seem to know black gold to use to fill trenches with fire to stop cavalry from jumping over it.</br></br>  <br>The nigga probably realized that if the invading forces trully wanted to just have everyone dead, the invading forces would already be in their doorsteps.<br><br>He used the allied nations to attack so that their forces thin like theirs. The JSDF has no choice but to attack only when provoked due to their oaths and shit anyway. And that smug smart bastard took advantage of the powerful yet docile invading forces.</br></br></br>  <br> How is this nigga planning to deal with the SDF? Surely he doesn't plan on conventional medieval combat <br>He doesn't know shit, anon. He has no idea how impossible it is for him to win, he seriously believed that his army has a chance if only they buy more time to train more troops. The lack of instant communication means info get diluted, you find out later that for the majority of the series the Emperor never believed any of the stories that the survivors told him.</br></br>  <br>Why not sending your troops in with shit that is so old they are on the same level as the enemy's equipment, so you can call yourself a fair guy?</br>  <br>You don't stop shooting because you think there are no enemies left. That's retarded and can get your men killed.<br><br>You shoot until your commanders think that there can't be any enemies left. You don't want one arrow to somehow hit someone in the neck due to a strong arm or magic just because you stopped shooting.</br></br></br>  <br>This. He wants to keep his control over the other nations so he used them as sacrifices while not sending even one of his soldiers after he noticied he would not be able to win and that they arent conquering them.</br>  <br>They weren't concerned about retreating back through the gate.<br><br>Only the deep recon teams were given dated equipment, and only because they knew nothing of the world outside of their encampment and were concerned that they might have to abandon their gear and retreat.<br><br>The 'retreat' being addressed here isn't egress through the gate, but the recon teams fleeing back to the defensive perimeter in the event that they encounter a situation.</br></br></br></br></br>  So how much did they censor this episode?  <br>Although all of that went out the window when Itami and co found Japanese citizens being enslaved by the empire.</br>  <br> The nigga probably realized that if the invading forces trully wanted to just have everyone dead, the invading forces would already be in their doorsteps. <br>This too. The Empire basically mistaken Japan's reluctance to invade as a sign of weakness. And this means for far too long they still thought they had a chance.</br></br>  <br> How is this nigga planning to deal with the SDF? Surely he doesn't plan on conventional medieval combat <br>Did you miss the bit where he said he'd poison all the wells and take all the livestock so that the army will have no resupply on their way to the capital? Even people from other planets have to eat food, right?<br><br>Unfortunately for him he's never heard of supply trucks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Was the first also censored in a way?<br><br>Man I need to know now so I don't download the Horriblesubs version again. What's the alternative that uses an uncensored version?</br></br></br>  <br>I really enjoyed the scene when the dragon's head is placed at the empire's capital as a result. That one gesture was more powerful than even taking out the senate.</br>  <br> Holy shit just send some guys there under flag of truce to "establish a dialogue" and find out more about them then. Once they come home with their report then you'll know more. <br>The Empire didn't believe they need to. They were the sole superpower for too long.</br></br>  <br>The Blurays you will be able to buy in 6 months.</br>  <br>Oooooh that's fucking smart. That's why he's a conqueror afterall.<br><br>So he has not heard of 2 years expiration date canned goods.</br></br></br>  <br>They also explained that why would they bring their next century scifi shit if they have no satellites to back them up. Everyone watches this with eyes closed or what?</br>  WHY THE FUCK HAVEN'T THEY FIXED THE TRANSLATION OF ITAMI'S RANK YET  <br>They are like 5 meters from the gate. Resupplies aren't a problem.</br>  <br>This makes more sense, but I still think that personal protection gear should have been current if they valued their soldiers, the army isn't so cheap to not be able to replace a dozen rifles and body armour.</br>  <br> 2 years <br>ayyyy</br></br>  <br>You can watch the raw in HQ and see the subbed version in mp4.</br>  <br>Here's a better idea. The ones on Arnus Hill send an envoy to tell the empire what exactly they're up against. A simple advanced reconnaissance force with enough firepower to wipe out a 75,000 man army in less than a day. And they aren't even the full force of their military and they aren't even the most powerful military from their world. Then tell them about nukes and the ability to wipe out a city in the blink of an eye. <br><br>See if the Empire is still willing to fight after that.</br></br></br>  <br>That fucking nationalistic boner was amazing for me.<br><br>Comparing the nation to a griffon that's had her young taken from her was great. Although it's probably unlikely this would happen in reality. I was expecting Itami and co to overreact, but when glasses also got serious/angry it became kinda unrealistic.</br></br></br>  <br>Humans have had ways of preserving food for thousands of years besides canning them, are you an idiot?</br>  <br>I love how fucking mad everyone is in GATE threads<br>Just a beer-drinking manga reader along for the ride, man</br></br>  <br>What is it meant to be?</br>  This seems interesting.<br>Please tell me it won't become elf harem shit.</br>  <br>Just like Japan itself was so eager to capitulate when they were told of nukes.</br>  <br> beer <br>wasted dub quad</br></br>  <br>No my intellectually bankrupt anon. He meant the distance between the gate and the main Capital.<br><br>To ensure that you actually reach the far place you still need to eat and drink. If everything between the Arnus Hill and Capital is burned and poisoned (no food and water) then assuming a 2 month journey on horse to the GATE then it would be fucking impossible to reach the capital.<br><br>But alas modern technology can both purify water from pee and have canned goods that last 2 years without rotting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was hoping for more /k/omfy threads, but I guess this show attracted the shitposters this season.</br>  <br> Please tell me it won't become elf harem shit. <br>If it did it would have already become one by now. Don't drop it just yet anon.</br></br>  <br>One rank above 2nd Lt.</br>  ROMUM ITE DOMUM  <br>He was second lieutenant promoted to first lieutenant after the Ginza incident.</br>  <br>Yes. That anon is an idiot. Always assume that anon are buffoons so that you don't drown yourself in disappointment. <br><br>This guy obviously doesn't know about marination, pickling, deep-frying, smoked and barreling.</br></br></br>  <br> . The ones on Arnus Hill send an envoy to tell the empire what exactly they're up against. <br>Over and over again, the Emperor were told what he is up against. He doesn't believe it. He still doesn't believe it when a gigantic decapitated dragon head appeared one night without anyone noticing on their castle walls.<br><br>Quite simply, the tech gap is so huge that there is no way words or letters could be convincing. It is too unbelievable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon....2 elfs, emperor daughter, a sorceress, a demigod and few random monster girls looking for a quick fuck</br>  <br>Remember that somewhere along the line the goal changed from bringing the Ginza perps to justice to finding oil and resources.</br>  <br>Ok so ONE demonstration for a nuke may be in order. No one would be willing to fight after that.</br>  <br>What you don't remember the glorious Total Eclipse subs?</br>  <br>What exactly was censored in the first episode to prompt you to even ask this?</br>  <br>The only thing I remember about those was calling Yuuya an Ensign even though he's Army not Navy.</br>  <br> when glasses also got serious/angry it became kinda unrealistic. <br>Yeah, any real diplomat would have dismissed her as inconsequential and focused on "the bigger picture". You can almost feel their annoyance of Itami's petty morals if this had happened with a real state department official.</br></br>  <br>You talk like a true american.</br>  <br>They weren't given old equipment because they were less valued or because it was too expensive.<br><br>They simply didn't want weapons or equipment falling into enemy hands. If the worst should happen and gear must be abandoned, it's better that it be inferior equipment so that the enemy isn't turning sniper rifles and LMGs back on the JSDF's position after a few months of training guerrillas.<br><br>Unintentionally leaving equipment your enemy can turn against them is probably the biggest threat to the JSDF, since the actual empire has little to no means of attack outside of whatever they can scavenge from the JSDF.<br><br>The recon force is armed for their own protection, but they aren't being sent out to search and destroy. They would be expected to avoid direct combat where possible and not carry out combat operations on their own, so they don't need 'the big guns'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what? Eating Jam? Eating Pickles? And eating salted fish? Is that even enough calories and nutrients to last you? Not to mention you need purewater, the dude wanted to poison all water resources from the gate to the castle. Water purifiers aren't a thing back then I would imagine.<br><br>The weather is hot/summer as we are shown at the show for now. And since it's a new big world, one can assume that the gate is extremely far from the capital, enough that your supply will rot unless you have some kind of magic/tech.</br></br></br>  <br>they're just going from series to series until someone bites<br><br>last week it was the gangsta threads, next week will be something else.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll keep watching for the setting alone.<br>I just hope it won't become all goofy.<br>i like the serious tone.</br></br></br>  So do they have other magic besides dragons?<br>I assume they do because the villagers aren't treating them as aliens or trying to stone them for witchcraft.</br>  <br> muh flags and muh gore <br>Apparently implications and french flags aren't enough</br></br>  <br>From the manga:<br>Other than one scene where he sleepily lusted over the magician sorcerer, the only semi-romance is between death loli and Itami.</br></br>  <br> Remember that somewhere along the line the goal changed from bringing the Ginza perps to justice to finding oil and resources. <br>Bring to Justice also meant repatriations, i.e. making the Empire pay for damages. Since the Empire can't pay with gold alone resources would have to do. Justice doesn't just mean prison time, it can be money too.</br></br>  <br> I just hope it won't become all goofy. <br>It's like a mix of goofy and serious.</br></br>  <br>Does it make much of a difference? Can you just simply promote someone from NCO to officer? I thought you had to go through some officer school first.</br>  <br>With their lack of knowledge artillery fire has the same effect honestly. Besides the leaders don't give a fuck unless they are at their doorstep.</br>  <br> Japan  <br> in charge of learning other languages <br>This is probably broken engrish tier.</br></br></br>   Right now, Meikon! Meikon!    they poison the wells using elves <br>Elves are confirmed for being AIDS-ridden cumwhores only used for public meat toilets.</br>  <br>It can't be that hard to hash out something that means "WALK HERE, ASS BURNS"</br>  <br> So do they have other magic besides dragons? <br>Magic is too hard and even Roman technology had surpassed battle mages. So basically magic is stagnating because it is hard to scale up.</br></br>  <br>You are a complete imbecile. It was not the nukes, but the Soviet conquest of Manchuria that Japan was truly sweating about. I shouldn't be responsible for your education, but please do others' sanity a favor and look into the deadlock of the Imperial Council for god's sake.</br>  What kinda outdated tanks are these  <br> sleepily lusted <br><br>More like "sleepily treated her like his daughter."</br></br></br>  <br>He was already an officer.<br><br><br>Itami didn't lust over Lelei.<br><br><br>Mind control.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whiskey if I feel like regularly drinking above my means<br><br><br>Going by how these threads always ended up even before the anime, there's just no way that would have happened.

They always had to forage or plunder to maintain their food stores. Logistics before the mid 20th century could not keep up.<br><br>Napoleon's army was defeated by scorched earth and winter. His soldiers ate their horses and then knawed on boiled leather out of desperation. They turned into what was described as an army of scarecrows, and this was as recent as 1812.<br><br>Germans in WW2 ran into a similar fate even with supply trucks and over 1 million horses hauling supplies. Scorched earth and winter are a deadly combination. They did not suffer as badly as Napolean did, but it still took an enormous toll on a modern army.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> harem of fujos <br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Just the usual blood and gore.

There are a lot of international treaties limiting what Isreal is allowed to do with its military because, if they were given a free hand they'd be marching through all of Anatolia burning and killing as they went. Isreal was formed knowing full well that its eventual leaders would champion manifest destiny harder than the Nazis and their military has various restrictions placed on it to help prevent them doing any more harm than they already do, restrictions that are regularly violated and then handwaved because Papa USA aproves.</br>  <br>i don't care if she may become a fujoshi, look that ass.</br>  <br>Japan doesn't technically have a full military. It's written into their constitution as a condition of their surrender in 1945.</br>  <br>The very fact that you lack the faculty to construct a properly formed sentence gives little credence that you could cite any proper source on the subject matter. Foreign Policy's paper, the analysis done by The Asia-Pacific Journal and Institute of Historical Review all pointed to how that Togo did not change his mind even after the report by Dr. Nishina was made (on the atomic bomb damage) until it was clear that USSR had declared war and invaded Manchuria. <br><br>You asinine baffoon.</br></br></br>  <br> acting intelligent on the internet <br> acting intelligent on 4chan even </br></br>  What are Pina's knights good for?

If harems become more niche about who they pander to, the genre can become less repetitive and more enjoyable for everyone.</br>  <br>The problem most people have with harems isn't the fact that the guy has several girls after his dick, it's the nigh-inescapable conventions of the genre. The beta MC, the main girl being the worst girl, the "accidents" and the girls inevitably resorting to intentional physical violence in retaliation, the shitty tsunderes.<br><br>Monster Musume doesn't really have any of that.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe but I want a Miia.</br>  <br>I need to know this please.<br>Cant download anything from where i am now</br></br>  <br>Yet they still lay on the puns, and 12beast isn't that great of a read with all the shit they fluff into it.<br><br>I may have issues with both sides but I won't stop supporting both sides.</br></br></br>  <br>With  a shotgun. </br>  <br>This. <br><br>Haremshit is part of the bread and butter of seasonal anime, and even more so after the LN adaptation craze the publishers are on.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon you're my hero, your post is perfect.</br>  Is protag ever turned on by Papi, or was miia more attractive to him despite not having legs?  <br>Stop asking and just read the fucking manga yourself.</br>  <br>S E C O N D A R Y</br>  <br>Darling loves all of the monster girls unconditionally.

Also bought an electric drum kit a few days ago thanks to Ritsu.</br>  <br>Guitar and keyboard.</br>  what kind of books do the keions read?<br> assuming yui and ritsu can read </br>  <br>Azusa - Guitar books/non-fiction<br>Mio- Love stories<br>Mugi - Classic novels<br>Ritsu - Manga  and love stories secretly <br>Yui - Manga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fifty shades of kei...on.</br>  <br>Exactly, the anything sexual about the keions in the steam group is a bannable offense.</br>    <br>I want to remove kebab with the keions</br>  <br>Ritsu belongs to Mio though.</br>  <br>how about removing cops with the keions?</br>  <br> How did you do that </br>  <br>It's a mod I made. do you want it?</br>  <br> Yes </br>    <br>here you go:<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/1<wbr>tft5xyarbgcso2/aimpoint_template.zi<wbr>p<br>the folder has aimpoints for each keion, but you can only use one at a time. for example if you want to use yui, put the "yui aimpoint" folder into \PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides<br>It only works for the military red dot sight.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>How are people still playing this?<br><br>I played for 60 hours after it was released and never touched it again. It's the same boring bottleneck with cops thing.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no mod_overrides folder, do I just make one or am I missing something</br>  <br>I am glad Yui likes manga, I cant wait to read Evangelion with her.</br>  <br>I'd imagine she reads more cute SoL type things</br>  <br>you have to make the folder.<br><br>I don't know. I've sunk almost 300 hours into this game, and I still can't stop playing.</br></br></br>  <br>That's fine then , I have some of those too. I wonder what her favorite manga is.</br>  <br> that's it </br>  <br>I mean series not type.</br>  <br>Lucky Star.</br>  <br>Nice! it works. That's pretty amazing, makes me want to start playing again</br>  <br>I can see that, I can see her being a Miyuki fan as well.</br>  <br>What's the best build, you wanker?</br>  <br>Yui seems like the sort of girl who'd laugh at things she can relate to, so she'd probably like Lucky Star.<br><br>As for Ritsu I can imagine her reading a lot of shounen.  Maybe even Berserk but just for the fights and not really understanding the themes and stuff. </br></br></br>  <br>I prefer a tech-forcer build, but dodge isn't bad either.<br>just make sure you don't play like this guy</br></br>  <br>I can Mugi reading Akira, and probably gangsta as well.</br>  Is it true that Mugi is mostly liked by mostly Blacks?<br><br>C/D?</br></br>  <br>She canonically has a black boyfriend</br>    <br>keions are sexy</br>  <br>Yes but they are also pure, nice, kind, modest,respectable people.<br>They are perfection  Azusa especially </br></br>  Which keion will get a boyfriend first and which one will get married first?  <br>Mio I reckon</br>  <br>I want to say Mugi</br>  <br>I thought gay marriage was illegal under the japanese constitution.</br>  <br>they'll move to canada then</br>  <br>Mio will be the first to get a boyfriend but Mugi will be the first to marry, an arranged marriage by her parents.</br>  <br>which keion will be the first to  do drugs? </br>   Mio getting a boyfriend <br><br>She won't</br></br>  <br>Ritsu by choice, Yui maybe if she's tricked into it.</br>  Calling it right now. At the end of One Piece, so in around 1000 chapters, Urouge will be a Yonkou called "The Highest Priest"!  <br>As opposed to what, him being a Yonkou called "Gan Fall" ?</br>  <br> A certain sky <br><br>there's only one goddamn sky</br></br></br>  <br>Says you.</br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  So how long until we see Doffy again<br><br>I miss him already</br></br>  <br>"Sky island"<br> shitty translation is shitty </br></br>  <br>No, but Fujitora and Urouge will.</br>  Why Capone is so based ?  Post your &gt;yfw when you found out the Foxy arc was not filler.<br><br>Here is mine.</br></br>  <br>The same for me anon , he was so perfect...</br>  <br>Satan pls stop haunting threads for the only sake of shitposting</br>    <br>Yet Mihawk dueled him, and considered him an equal. And once again, food is food. Luffy will eat anything, but prefers meat. Do we know that bento was only rice?<br><br><br>That was me as well.</br></br></br></br>  Reckon Capone actually fought Kidd ?  Why is it that no one calls Oda out on his character designs?<br><br>Why is it okay for him to take a famous person's appearance for a character instead of designing his own?</br></br>  <br>We call him out all the time on his sameface girl characters.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>Half of it was in the anime.</br>  <br>Why not ? What are you, his mother ?</br>  <br> Why is it okay for him to take a famous person's appearance for a character instead of designing his own? <br>because countless artists do that all the fucking time</br></br>  <br>Because he usually adds a unique personality to said celebrity and then adds another element to their look/design?<br><br>Plus, it's downright funny to see a caricature of a celeb getting beat up or act silly.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont personally mind it since a lot of my favorite characters are facerips<br><br>it just seems lazy and something i'd think people would criticize. I can't even think of another artist that does this so blatantly</br></br></br>  Will we ever see breasts used in combat again?   shanks spanks the 3 supernovas <br> gets weakened a bit <br> BB appears laughing <br> Starts beating Shanks badly <br> Is about to finish him off <br> but wait,something appears in the sky <br> is it a bird,is it a plain,no its fucking Marco <br> kills BB with his talons of rage <br> they become best buddies with shanks <br><br>Please Oda let this happen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;gets weakened a bit <br>eh<br> deus ex Marco <br>I like you</br></br></br></br>  I don't even know who I want to win this thing. I love both sides too much.  <br> pls write like a 10 year old Oda-senpai <br>pls no</br></br>  <br>I can see Marco swooping in and smashing Teach away, giving Shanks enough time to recover his posture.</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>no<br> baby 5 will </br></br>  <br>Oh come on, Kid is cool and all but this fucking Shanks we're talking about here. His whole crew is full of loveable bastards. Even fucking Rockstar wanted to jump WB's ass for insulting Red Hair.</br>  <br>Who is Diamante based on?</br>  So Law is just going to be okay with the marines taking Doffy away, so he can eventually get out of jail and cause harm to the world again? not even going to try one last ditch shot at killing him?<br>lame.</br>  <br>Steven Tyler</br>  <br>Doffy is dying in this very moment retard. The marines don't know that law shot his organs, so they aren't aware about his life ending right there.</br>  <br><br>Thought Jango was supposed to be Jackson tho</br></br>  <br>He fainted. I don't want to hear a thousand people screaming "asspull" over and over again, thank you very much.</br>  <br> implying Oda killing the biggest party animal in the OPverse is mature <br>Apply yourself BBfag</br></br>  <br>He never wanted to kill him per se. He wanted him to suffer. The original plan, if successful, entailed having Doffy run for his life from Kaido and if caught, then beaten enough to have Doffy run away without fighting back any longer. Rinse and repeat if applicable or have Doffy die then. Regardless the outcomes, the suffering would be real.</br>  <br>some get used twice I believe<br><br>Hody is Michael Jackson<br>Franky and Bentham are both Jim Carrey</br></br></br></br>  <br> WBfags being this butthurt <br>How about you get over it, son?</br></br>  <br>Doffy's organs probably repaired themselves before the fight ended. He's fine</br>  DUMPING!    <br/>    <br><br/></br>  <br>I miss パン</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  Read before posting buyfag.moe    <br>Yeah but they don't have a prototype yet.<br><br><br>Pre-painted ones are limited mail-orders after C88.</br></br></br></br>  I just got the Lupin Revoltechs from an anon on /toy/. They're really on point with their likenesses from the first series.  <br>I can't really afford 39k for a single figure, even if it's this magnificent Jiji. I need to have some money saved if Imanotsurugi gets anything. <br><br><br>They should just make both. I hope OR stops being boring with the poses, some damaged ones would be wonderful to have.</br></br></br></br>  Bought a fig off Manda and it came shrinkwrapped. Whole box is completely shrinkwrapped. Okay then.  It's a filler episode  fuck off  <br>When's the next Evangelion movie?<br>Hopefuly never.</br></br>  It's a flashback episode  <br>LMAO</br>  Sup /a/, I'm looking to get into Fist of the North Star for the first time, but I'd like some advice on ideal places to start. Should I watch a specific anime? Or should I just jump into the manga?  Manga. Has better art and pacing. Both 80s anime and manga are cheesy, but the anime is cheesier in a bad animation kind of way.<br><br>Oh, and don't read HnK2.</br></br>  read the manga  Mad Max.  the anime has one of the best soundtracks ever, great voice acting, and superior character designs  I never thought there could be a bigger bitch than Kirino...  <br>How self-centered. I hate people like you.</br>  Umaru uses Leach Seed!<br>Umaru uses Fake Tears!<br>Umaru uses Attract!<br>Umaru uses ???</br></br></br>  HOW IS THIS LEGAL?  <br>Anon uses single-penis bukkake!<br>It's a critical hit!<br><br>PREGNANCY ALL OVER!</br></br></br></br>  <br> great <br>That's a weird way to spell shit</br></br>  New material for the movie: Hinata and Himawari's sketches.  <br>What does she care, she's got Sai on lock<br><br>No other girl can do freaky mindswap sex with him</br></br></br>  <br>wouldn't her trick be basically roofy date raping herself using some guy's body?<br><br>where does the other person's perception go?</br></br></br>  <br>It can stay were it is, subdued or they can pretty much switch places and/or link their perceptions.<br>So Sai would feel himself in Ino''s body getting fucked by his own body, feel his own body's pleasure of fucking Ino, who would likewise get both body's pleasure but also the echo of them sent via perception link from Sai, and send it once more back to him etc.<br>It's a small wonder they ever stop fucking.</br></br></br>  <br>Whoops, meant to reply to </br>    IT'S FUCKING EP 2 AND WE ARE ALREADY HAVING CRAZY TURNS.  <br> out of the blue <br>heh</br></br>  <br>The 4th one is probably light.</br>  <br>Patchouli's spells.</br>    </blockquote>]
