I WANT TO FUCK A BIRD  <br>Didn't she have big boobs only when transformed?</br>  Zombina and Polt are top tier.  But everyone is best girl.   Now watch the threads become so much more enjoyable while a certain someone is banned(?).    Why is this anime so perfect? Production, direction, soundtrack. Not a single complaint. How is that even possible, especially considering its Lerche.  <br>You guys might think i'm weird for this but... I want her to sit on my face with her human body...</br>   Miia's mom says he's packing <br> is a slut <br> Suu calls him small <br> rapes girls <br><br>Which is it, /a/?<br>Does Suu only like it huge?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Stitch where?  <br>I missed something ?</br>  <br>Will come buckets when get to hear her voice some more.</br>  Papi's VA is perfect. She's too cute.  <br>seems fair, I'd like a chokehold with her thighs</br>  I want to Zombina's bone-dry holes and use her blood as lube.    <br>You know the guy who'd make the whole "ignore the shitposters/secondaries yatta yatta" ops, turns out it may have been the same guy that made the same threads on different boards so he got b&amp;</br>  <br>Notice the 100% reduction in terms like 'secondaries and animeonlyfags'.

I... I need to know  <br> blood <br>About that...</br></br>  <br>PAPI THE HARPY!</br>    <br><br>There was some guy who was spamming the thread crosslinking to various boards, saying only "NEW THREAD." There was also a guy screaming about "secondaries" and such. They also got deleted. So there's suspicion that they were all the same person.<br><br>It seems to be a 1 day ban, if this list is correct:<br><a href="https://www.4chan.org/bans" target="_blank">https://www.4chan.org/bans</a></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>suu likes all kinds of sizes</br>  <br>Hmm, since suu can change her size at will, its likley that her standards of size are different.</br>  <br>he was obviously trying to get people 'mad at secondaries' by spamming the anime everywhere</br>  <br>There's Monmusu Quest. Basically an RPG, but if you lose a battle, you get raped.</br>  You guys talk about Miia's belly all the time but what about Mero's belly? Her's is nice too until you reach the gills  <br> she can become smaller and tighter if your dong is small <br> she can become bigger to fit all of you in <br><br>Why is she so perfect?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not parpy the papi <br><br>Kek, this guy.</br></br></br>  <br>She knows nothing about sizes so she's probably wrong.<br><br><br>She's toxic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her gills are cute, don't bully Mero.</br>  <br>Mero's cute, but I just don't really like her character all that much. Hopefully the next chapter will fix that.</br>  <br> parpy the papi <br> not harpy the parpy <br><br>Get out of here kid</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mero's design is actually crazy cute. The issue being that Okayado is damn uninspired when it comes to have her character do shit.</br>  <br>I trust snake slut over slime slut. Snake slut would thoroughly know dicks while I don't imagine slime slut would. Good for Darling.</br>  <br>parappa the rapper</br>  <br>I have to say that the op song sucks. But the op animation is enjoyable.</br>    I want to fuck Papi raw.  <br>Am I the only one who absolutely adores the gills? Like ignoring the tail aspect, its my favorite monster thing about her. <br><br> You will never run your fingers over her gills from behind causing her to gasp in surprise as she turns back to kiss you. </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck.</br>    <br>Nigga that'd be like someone running their finger over your exposed lungs.<br><br> I'd do the same too it's probably ticklish. </br></br></br>  <br>That ED is amazing though</br>  <br>How many times?</br>  <br> Implying she wouldn't be the one fucking you raw first <br><br>Like you have the stamina to keep up.</br></br></br>  The lack of uncensored titties is making this anime terribly lackluster compared to the manga.

With all the TLR:Ds and Shinmais and Prison Schools out there now, it's nice to see an anime that doesn't treat its TV audience like complete dogshit.</br></br></br>  So if they run out of monsters to give subspecies for, will they just loop back and list more subspecies for lamia, etc?  <br>Will the BD's even matter if character's are always standing in the way of the tits so they can't be uncensored anyway</br>  Tell me there is already highres wallpaper with pic related.  <br>Suu is saying the pool is too small.</br>  <br>With the pacing we're on, they'll never have a shortage of new species.</br>  <br>All three</br>  <br>Mero while wearing a rebreather.</br>  <br>Mero.

I think Punk Hazard, myself. No way they're getting by two Logias and a Haki master without Haki skills of their own.  How the hell do you think Big Mom fights? Her ability most definitely has to do with food/eating, but I can't see it working without just rehashing Wapol's ability. Besides she's fat and big as fuck, can she even stand?  <br>They'd get through by the power of nakama.</br>  <br>My father's cock has been limp for years now though.

Is it possible full-body Haki is proportionately weaker than concentrating it all in one place?</br>  <br>he doesn't need to. he mastered his devil fruit pretty well instead</br>  <br>who are those people in between luffy and franky?</br>  <br>They're supposed to join the crew later on, they're friends of Jinbei.</br>  <br>That's the slaver, I think his name was Duval, that drove the crew to the Slave Auction House on Saobody on the flying fish.<br><br>Robin used to have orange hair.<br><br>And the One Piece mascot, who doesn't appear in the show, it's just cute and moe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drip and Rebecca<br><br>The raccoon is probably Pato</br></br></br>  <br>Duval, Koala, and Mansherry</br>  <br>I'm 100% sure Crocodile is going to bail him out. <br>Their "friendship" has already been foreshadowed a lot of times. <br>Plus,  Doffy x Croco OTP </br></br></br>  <br>Doffy and Luffy can, however you're seeing it as some sort of superior technique/power up when in reality it's just better to coat a single part of your body to either attack or defend, for the look of things full body coating waste too much haki and was used for brawlers to go against swordsmen, it accomplished nothing both times.</br>  <br>Doffy and Croco will do the fusion dance and form Crocoffy.<br><br>He'll have both the Ito Ito and the Suna Suna</br></br></br>  Reminder that Garp is coming to Dressrosa and hes probably forgotten who Chinjao even is.  <br>Though Zoro is an expert in AH, and he needed a Haki-infused, souped-up version of his strongest non-Asura attack to bring Pica down.<br><br>It likely wasn't as easy a victory as it appeared.</br></br></br>  <br><br> That's not Rikudo no Tsuji </br></br>  <br>Garps strongest mode is probably when he goes full body haki<br><br>He can probably sink an entire Island with one punch in that form</br></br></br>  <br>Was that the thing he used on the Kraken? Eh, didn't impress me as much as Sanzen Sekai, considering he used it on a squishy squid.</br>  <br> Crocoffy. <br><br>It's Dofladile you uncultured pleb.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But look at the damage area. Imagine that with Haki.</br></br>  <br>What is this exactly?</br>  <br>great taste</br>   people actually think Crocoboy was a female   <br> People actually think crocomom was male </br>  <br>I believe it depends on if using CoA for attack or defense, both Vergo and Pika tried to protect their entire body from flying slashes, full body haki is basically tekkai, though I would say (If not against swordmen) it's better to use it like Doffy or Luffy and just activate haki through your body at please.</br>  <br>You don't like Lady Croc?</br>  <br>Celestial Dragons will probably just assassinate Doffy and his crew to keep the secret</br>  <br>You stupid.<br><br><br>He's a guy though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't care much for the theory, I'm just here for the fanart.</br>  When was the last time Luffy defeated someone who was his rival in strength but also around his age?<br><br>Does Luffy do nothing but fight power-hungry old men?</br></br>  <br>If your CoO haki is on point, full body armament is a waste as pointed out by others. Just coat the part intercepting the hit.</br>  <br>Like a fucking flower: Doffadile! (Well... almost).</br>  <br> not dofuwani <br><br>do you even cute, anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuckin' sand strings as a weapon? How would that even work</br>  <br>That was actually my first impression as well.</br>  Isn't it kinda sad how far he's been left in the dust? Even the Vice Admirals were singing his praises, once upon a time. Now most people seem to think he'd lose to freaking Hody. I don't agree personally, but still.   Crocodile is born female <br> She runs into Whitebeard and somehow ends up admiring/loving the guy and wants to sail the seas with him. <br> She finds out that he's a homosexual and only allows dudes to be on his mobyDICK <br> She seeks out Ivankov and begs it to turn him into a dude, penis and all.  <br> Iva complies. <br> Crocoboy goes back to whitebeard with a penis between his legs and asks to join once more. <br> Whitebeard recognizes croc regardless of the change and tells her that tricks are for kids and to gtfo his ship.  <br> Crocoboy is BTFO and goes back to paradise with his newly acquired tail between his legs.  <br><br>Makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot one part<br> &gt; &gt;Crocoboy is BTFO and goes back to paradise with his newly acquired tail between his legs.  <br> Fucks Doflamingo to cheer himself up <br> starts planning to conquer alabasta </br></br></br></br>  <br> Doflamingo can't forget about him and relentlessly pursues him </br>  <br>He's an assassin. He's much better at killing people who don't know he's there.</br>  <br>To be fair, Hody took a whole bunch of magic pills that doubled his power each time. He also turned super saian, and was fighting under water.<br><br>Luccy could wipe the floor with Hody's entire gang at base level.</br></br></br>  <br>I find it hard to believe any form of Hody could beat Lucci, actually. All Hody is is tankier. Lucci's greater speed and versatility would win him the fight, IMO.</br>  <br>Super Hody, when barely even trying, managed to throw drops of water hard enough that it went through buildings and it kept going for miles.</br>  <br>Bravo Mashima</br>  <br>Still not very impressive by this series' standards IMO. Given all the hype the Rokuougan got, I suspect about 7-10 of those would drop Hody.</br>  <br><br> tells her that tricks are for kids and to gtfo his ship. </br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_XU<wbr>PVyzZXRM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>good song<br><br>I miss the ending songs</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even going by Lucci's own bullshit power levels, Hody is MUCH stronger.<br><br> The average soldier is 10 doriki <br><br> Fishmen are 10x the strength of men (100 doriki) <br><br> Lucci is 4000 <br><br> even saying that Hody was average for a fishman, it would only take Hody 6 pills to be stronger than Lucci (100 - 200 - 400 - 800 - 1600 - 3200 - 6400) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doriki only measure physical strength and didn't take his DF in account, or Rokushiki or anything else.</br>  <br>That would mean the difference between the pre and post-skip Straw Hats would be absolutely absurd...</br>  <br>and then Goku's is around 50 000 so he must be stronger the pre time skip Gohan</br>  <br>Did you see the latest chapter?<br><br>Zeref, Natsus brother and creator is the emperor of the Albareth empire<br><br>Mashima can't go an entire arc without announcing zeref</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Took me a while.</br>  <br>They did. Just look at how they performed against the Pacifista before and after</br>  <br>Oh, right, those guys. Could one of those beat Lucci, you think? Lucci was a match for Luffy. The Pacifista was a match for the entire crew.</br>  <br>And wait, if Pacifista &gt; Lucci, and Luffy can OHKO a Pacifista... does that mean Luffy could OHKO Lucci now? Hot damn.</br>  Been rereading the colored version of one piece. I dont know if it is just this translation but is this the reason Zoro is so stronk now? is the present the first time since the mihawk fight where Zoro has been at 100%?  doflamingo could beat luffy in a 1v1<br><br>only pissbabby luffyfags would deny this</br></br>  <br>I think it was strongly implied that Doffy could solo Luffy without all those handicaps.</br>  Gear Four is the ultimate counter to Doffy's fighting style  <br>Zoro almost always has a handicap. Previously wounded (Cabaji, Hachi), missing swords (Nyaban Bros., Ryuma), opponent almost impossible to actually hit (Mr. 1, Pica), take your pick.</br>  <br>Of course, retards here will deny it which is why I'm posting it.</br>  <br>hm, I might do that too, where's a good place to find the colour version/</br>  <br>I read while at work so i use Batoto. But im sure there are some anons here who know of a better way</br>  <br>In general yes, but we don't know how Gear 4 would have stacked up against Doffy at 100%.</br>  <br>It would've been more even, but I still predict Luffy would have won.</br>  <br>doffy handicapped took gear 4 and was still standing, healthy doffy would have raped luffy</br>  Post yfw Luffy OHKO'd the Pacifista  <br>Sure, why not. But guess what, by round two, Luffy would have found some way to take him out, be it pure skill or some weakness exploit. That's kind of the OP formula. The best similar case being the fight with Crocodile. Hell, you can look at the citizens keeping Luffy alive for those 10 min as Robin saving him after his first fight with Crocodile.</br>  <br>Progress.</br>  <br>Kek. Dat filename.</br>  <br>This<br>Kek</br></br>  I just caught up to the anime. Should I read the manga from the start or start off from the Dressrosa arc?  <br> I just caught up to the anime. <br>how you managed to get through the torture that is everything past enies lobby/thriller bark is beyond me</br></br>  <br>well meme'd friend. now gtfo</br>  <br>Your choice really. The art is incredible in manga form, but if you really want to just start from Dressrosa. Make sure you don't read cancerous translations though.</br>  Shouldn't the VIZ scan for 793 be out by now?  <br>http://imgur.com/a/0Lxw6<br><br>VizAnon is behind but someone else uploaded it.</br></br></br>  <br>This is why powerlevel fags will never understand One Piece.</br>  I ripped the manga from mangastream.to - the first few chapters are good, but the next hundred or so are terribly translated, on top of being low-res. What source do you guys recommend?<br><br>I know, I'm very late.</br></br>  <br>bakabt has a pretty decent collection for the pre-timeskip stuff. So long as you see null or nep ece you're good.</br>  <br>To be honest despite annoyances like Zolo, I think Viz has the best translations, at least I think they try to maintain the character's personality in their dialogue translations, but it's hard to find scans of their old stuff online.</br>  <br> Mihawk cuts Zolo almost in half <br> Luffy jumps at him <br> screams "DARN YOU" </br></br></br>  Face it. Gin's dead.  Do any of you actually believe Crocodile was originally a woman?  <br>I really, really, REALLY want it to be true</br>  <br>No, but I like the fan art.</br>  <br>I'm not making any decisions about it, but it seems plausible.</br>  <br>It would make him a much more interesting character.<br>I'm still not convinced he never was.<br>Oda had to have hidden his face at Roger's execution for a reason.<br><br>The Luffy's mom aspect is dumb though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When was the last time Luffy defeated someone who was his rival in strength but also around his age? <br>When he fought Zoro on Whiskey Peak.</br></br>  <br>He'll be stronger when he appears again.</br>  <br>Lucci was in his late twenties, so he wasn't old old just older than Luffy by about ten years.</br>  <br>I needed to see how bad it could be. The Sabaody Archipelago was enjoyable enough for me, though.<br> <br>I think I'll start from the beginning then.

It's the same word that Sengoku used as a password for Rocinante.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did he say crackers in Japanese version?</br>  <br>Not him but it took me a while to realize this too. Probably because we used to see Sengoku in a much more serious light.</br>  <br>If he said okaki then it's Sengoku. If he said Senbei then it's Garp.</br>  <br>Yeah but it's important to note that the word is okaki, not senbei.<br><br>Plus you know... Inspector General.</br></br></br>  <br>What on earth Law.......... What is this? Can someone explain? I'm curious if there's more. What is this about? A deck of cards?</br>  <br>This.

That's why I said that. It shows him reading it this morning in chapter 700.</br></br>  <br><br>My bad, I made a mistake, you're right.</br></br>  Is there a chapter break next week?  <br>Find out on Thursday.<br><br>Probably.

I think there were even some lizardmen, and people was hoping we would get to at least the Shalltear fight, but I'm growing more and more worried about just barely making it to the graveyard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the way you think.</br>  <br>I've been a wizard for 2 years, where do I get my lich license?</br>  <br>Something about this image is...off.</br>  <br>You need to go down to the DMV.</br>  <br>Yeah, I expected the mirror to show up so episode 3 could lead straight to him fucking up the raiders with the death knight.<br><br><br>BUT I CAN'T BE A FUCKING WIZARD WHEN I'M MERELY A 3D</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just gonna start reading the LN, I didn't expect it to be translated up to the 4th vol (completely).</br>   This will be only 13 episodes <br><br>God damnit.</br></br>  <br> tripfag <br> shit taste <br><br>Why am I not surpised?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck, I hate going there, the vampire at the counter is always retarded.</br>  SHALLTEAR A CUTE<br><br>A CUTE</br></br>  KOTAE WA DOKO HEEEEEEEIEEIEEEEEEE  <br>SAGASH TEEEEEEEEIEEEEIEEE</br>  <br>WITH MY SOOOOUL</br>    <br>WITH MY HEARRRRTTTT</br>  <br>Are you sure it isn't a ghoul?</br>  <br>ITSUDEMO SAGASHITEIRUYO</br>  <br> Yeah, I expected the mirror to show up so episode 3 could lead straight to him fucking up the raiders with the death knight. <br>EXACTLY those are my thoughts exactly!<br><br><br>Its worth it, have fun.<br><br><br>Im gonna screencap my post and your post so I can later post them when you fags start trying to claim my Narberal<br><br>So, how far do you think ep 3 will get to? im thinking using the mirror, and only just releporting to Carne</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WE ARE RULING NOMARETEKU</br>  <br>put the name into the title you absolute cock mongrol</br>  How hard would your dick be daily if you had both of these vying for your dick and seed?  <br> when you fags <br>You mean other people with shit taste?</br></br>    <br>one more time</br>  <br>We need more crazy Alberdo fanart.</br>  How come MCs of these shows are supposedly #1 in the game but never have any of the personality traits of people who actually get world firsts in MMOs? Where's the elitism and min-maxing?  <br>It doesn't do anything if you're not yourself horny.<br>So if I were a skeletor with no libido then I'd be just annoyed, the same way as when an ugly girl tries to hit on you.</br></br>  <br>Slightly softer then with Narberal but still near max on the Mohr scale</br>  <br> I know their true forms, I don't want anything to do with them.</br>    IMO the OP is pretty generic and has way too much autotune, not sure why people are creaming themselves over it.<br><br>On the other hand, the ED is fucking amazing. DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION</br></br>    <br>I only found her  cuh-razey  fanart.</br>  <br>Your love isn't true<br><br>Begone<br><br>Heathen <br><br><br> complains the OP has too much autotune <br> likes the ED <br><br>Pick one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> MUH REALISM <br>Cancer</br></br>  <br>Am I the only one dissapointed in Momonga's ingame voice? I wish it would be something more rattling or demonic, like this  sorry for /v/ : https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4XF<wbr>Vlob57tY</wbr>  [ ]</br>    I have the urge to rabage Shalltear.  <br>Can we just agree that this is one of the better OP ED pairs we have seen in a while?</br>  <br>I recall someone saying that Gargantua was too big to move around, so Momonga decided that he shouldn't bother. Or maybe because it's not sentient. Honestly I don't remember which.</br>    Is the manga monthly or weekly?    <br> He isn't #1 and his build is kind of shit considering he went full RP.</br>    <br>Isn't Funi doing the whole dub simulcast thing with Overlord?</br>  <br>Calm down, tide hunter.</br>  <br>monthly</br>    <br>I'm not interested with dubs. I posted an english voice as example just because it was the closest thing I could find.</br>  <br>MUSIC GOT ME FEELIN SO FREE<br>WE GONNA CELEBRATE</br></br>   All this yandere albedo <br><br>I think I'm in love. Best girl of all time.</br></br>  <br>Am I gay for thinking that guy is sexy as fuck?</br>  <br>Yes but it's alright he's pretty sexy.</br>  Can we all agree that cocytus is best boy?  <br>It feels good being both and albedo and shalltearfag<br><br>Fucking double the faps</br></br></br>  <br>Wait. Shalltear's alternate form we know. But how's Albedo?<br><br>Also they look kinda as if they want someone for dinner in </br></br></br>  <br>You like the OP? I couldnt get into its mood. It doesn't seems to fit at all.<br><br>I get the feeling it should be either funny or grimdark, and right now its trying to be action and.... honestly I have no idea what the idea was. Its horrible.<br><br>I dont mind the autotune, I just dont like the mood it tries to go with.<br><br>The ED has a clear mood, so its good, but the OP... I dont know what im supposed to feel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You wouldn't date a non-human.  <br>If liking snazzy suits is wrong, I don't want to be right.<br><br><br>He seems like a bro, yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know, I know. I was just curious if they did do that. I get a good laugh out of dubs and thought if they did one for Overlord I would get a kick of the english banter.<br>As for Momonga, I honestly thought they would go with Koyasu Takehito given his track record.</br></br>    <br> Well, Albedo called Shalltear a "lamprea" and Shalltear called Albedo a "gorila", so guess.</br>  <br> Jitsu wa <br> Monsta Musume <br> Overlord <br><br>Fuck you I would if I could.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They aren't bad, but I don't see what's so good about them.</br>  Why is shalltear so cute when she's smug?  <br>She's just a semen demon anon. Aren't the horns enough for you?<br><br><br>You wouldn't bone a skeleton</br></br></br></br>  <br>Manga Cocytus is more bro than anime one.</br>    <br>Depends. Just how lewd and crazy does she get when around overbone?</br>  <br>Well, it's not that I care that much about realism but the MC of this and Log Horizon are fucking dullards and being casuals only exacerbates it.</br>  <br>But that's heretic love.</br>  <br>wrong fucking picture</br>  <br>Remember that one guy who married a video game 6 years back?</br>  <br>Pick up that bone or I'll unleash the venom.</br>  <br>Seriously, does she suck someone dry in that alter form?<br><br><br>  Muscled Albedo <br><br>Owww my GOD...<br><br><br>Doesn't mean that semen demons don't eat anything besides semen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Koyasu Takehito as Papa Bones <br><br>holy shit, I would cum if this was the case</br></br></br>  <br>We haven't seen much of anime cockytus yet, give it some time.<br><br><br>Don't mind the Nerbfags, they just enjoy their "devoted classical japanese beauty" maid fantasies. REAL best girl is obviously Albedo.</br></br></br></br>  Is there an Overlord height chart?  <br> &gt; Muscled Albedo <br>It's already confirmed she's got abs of steel. Or some other harder metal.</br></br>  <br>this picture gets me all sorts of fucking hard<br><br>Shalltear is gorgeous</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz is far from being a casual though. He's just careful, which is exactly what you should be in such a weird situation.<br><br><br>Semen demons feast on a healthy diet of semen, wet dreams and the undying adoration of their skeletal masters.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> if you like someone other than the retarded maid you're a secondary <br>Sasuga tripfag, hope you enjoy the shit tier girl who can't even follow basic orders like "don't blow our cover and don't have a bloodlust aura around humans"</br></br></br>  <br> personality traits of people who actually get world firsts in MMOs <br>Autism.</br></br>  <br>Just watched episode 2 and it's a pretty good adaption of the LN. But I feel bad for the anime only fags, the first two episode are slow and it doesn't have the impact to draw in new crowds. <br><br>Depending on what the goal of the anime is, promotion of the LN or a treat just for his fans, it could meet or fuck up it's goal.</br></br></br>  Fucking useless Google.      <br>Both</br>    Albedo for best waifu<br>Cocytus for best uncle<br>Shaltear for  slut <br>also, holy shit i like how they draw them in the fight scene after momonga left, im so hyped i don't want to kill myself anymore yay</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. I haven't read the LN  yet  but I'd say the show has peaked my interest and has my attention<br> What the shit captcha?

LN readers think they are doing a good job?  <br>Better than expected start.</br>  Go to Settings at the bottom right of this page.<br>Under 'Quotes and Replying', check the 'Legacy CAPTCHA' box.<br>At least that's how I remembered it.</br></br>    <br>He's 30 meters tall.</br>  <br><br>Whoops, forgot to quote.</br></br>  How fucking stupid must Brain feel that he's attacking godtear full force and she's yawning  <br>Who drew this?</br>  <br>Oh hey, it works.</br>    DEARINSU KA?  <br>Shalltear for  chair </br>  <br> Albedo holder her own horn <br><br>My fucking dick.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the artist, sorry should have worded it better.</br>  <br>Would read a crossover of this.</br>    <br><br>Ah, thanks for clarifying.</br></br>  <br>What a manlet</br>  <br><br>But if they wanted to show more impact on the first episode, using the prologue of vol 1 should be more exciting</br></br>  <br>Gamagoori please</br>    <br>The prologue was fucking boring and generic. I liked the animu opening a lot more.</br>  Someone tell me when they're finally shutting down WoW so I can become papa bones and get a Shalltear gf one day.  <br>/fit/ calm down.</br>  <br>bu-but Anon th-thats lewd</br>  <br>Yeah, if I had voice a major complaint is that he needs to do more monologues but that would be almost movie tier length if they added those in.</br>  Mare gatting boned  <br>Ishida Akira.

That's what got me. Anyways cute girls with brown hair always gets me.</br>  Do Kagafags not sleep? They everywhere.  <br>What are you talking about? No Kagafags spamming Kaga, it's the hater.</br>   specialize in fleet carriers, get Taihou in 2 tries <br> try making LSC battleships <br> nothing but yamashiro over and over again </br></br>  <br>Keep being delusional, Kagafag.</br>  <br>It's a sign.</br>  <br>This guy gets it.</br>  <br> spams Kaga <br> hates Kaga <br>I do not see the logic here, troll or otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, her sidetail, exposed neck, Tsurime eyes, her personality and voice really got me. Blue also my favourite color. She also got tragic back story.</br>   Kagahater is literally so obsessed about hating Kaga he spams her every thread <br><br>Damn, guy must have issues in real life.</br></br>  <br>Or the Kagafag is acting like a Kagahater because he seems to have two personality.</br>  <br>We're on 4chan talking about chinese cartoon girls dressed up as boats that killed a lot of people, we all have issues.</br>  <br><br>He spams Kaga and Ooi because he hates Kagafag and Pengo-san. He want you guys to get mad at Kagafags</br></br>  <br> implying this isn't the most healthy and real way of living </br>    <br><br/></br>  Fubuki is the cutest.  CUTEST   <br>I embrace the degeneracy.</br>  <br>There are no such thing, all Kagafag love Kaga. I know because I'm a Kagafag</br>  <br>Yes!</br>  Kaga is wonderful!  <br>Yes, Kaga makes my heart doki-doki</br>  Man I want to post cute Kagapic soo bad  thinkin about kongou  Kaga chan, kawaii. <br><br>Because she's a fucking sex goddess in the bedroom.</br></br>  <br>Yes, Kaga-san is moe and sugoi.</br>  <br>Fanart(giving fake personality to no personality chan) and stats.</br>  <br> no personality chan <br>Retard</br></br>  <br>?</br>  <br>How many more times are you going to say this? Is that all a Kagafag can say?</br>  <br>You're retarded, Kaga got personality, read her weddings line already.<br><br>Better than saying fuck you, penis, etc</br></br></br>  <br> still that one line argument <br>Based on that I can legitimately assume she's gay just based on that other line too, sounds fair, dont you think?</br></br>  <br>But Kaga is not gay</br>  <br>The wedding line can imply she's gay too. Nothing says that Admiral has to be male.</br>  <br>Which side you're on?</br>  <br> Kaga <br> personality <br>Kaga has the personality of a dry towel.</br></br></br>  <br>Not yours?</br>  <br>Kagafag BTFO.</br>  Haters gonna hate, I'm out.<br><br>Kaga is love and life</br></br>  <br>Also the people dont even like her non existent personality, just the group of traits she possesses. Most like her side tail and brown hair, more than one girl have those traits too.<br><br>Thats true too.<br><br>Explain yourself and dont run, you coward, how are you gonna protect that piece of junk like that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>How like a Kagafag to post like a reddit-tier cancer.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with plain girls</br>  <br>There's a big difference between plain and nothing.</br>  <br> Explain yourself and dont run, you coward, how are you gonna protect that piece of junk like that? <br>He can't even explain something that have no personality to begin with.</br></br>    What a pointless argument and Kagahaters ganging up on a Kagafag.  <br>Not our fault he can't even protect his no personality ship.</br>  <br>Cute, she got everything I like</br>  <br> "Damn, guy must have issues in real life" <br> this coming from a guy who browses kancolle generals everyday </br></br>   13k steel <br> 15k ammo <br> 12k bauxite <br><br> 380 fuel </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because</br>  <br>Yes, they're pathetic</br>  Kaga is fun to abuse, even more so than Zuikaku. <br><br>And I like abusing Zuikaku, a lot.</br></br>  <br>Why are you still here?<br/></br>  <br>Holy shit do you think your pathetic act is only about you and another person? Everyone is watching you being retarded, autistic cunt.</br>  <br>She's cute.<br>And I have a major soft spot for side ponytails.<br>And thigh-highs.</br></br></br>  <br> BTFO </br>  <br>Why are Kagafags so pathetic?</br>    <br>I think he's pointing at you for being pathetic.</br>    Can we go one thread without arguing over kagafags?!<br>It's tearing us apart!</br>  <br>Shit fetish</br>  <br>Why doesn't she have heart pupils?</br>  <br>And Kagafags butthurt but unable to explain themselves aren't?</br>  <br>It is my belief that Kagafags simulate the living conditions of the Kaga crew making it near impossible for them to sleep.</br>  <br>But forcing your opinion into others and arguing is much more pathetic.</br>   Does impregnating Yamashiro count as bullying her?   Mogami &gt; Kaga  <br>For you</br>  <br> forcing your opinion into others <br>Aren't that Kagafags? They post her in every thread and shitpost other girls to death when they are posted.</br></br>  <br>Why is there always such an abundance of ammo?</br>  <br>Because you aren't crafting enough.</br>  <br>Because expeditions don't use ammo and like half of the maps have ammo nodes.</br>  <br> shitpost other girls to death when they are posted <br>Why you always put everything to blame on Kagafags?</br></br>  <br>my current recipe only uses 30 ammo.</br>  <br>The most recent Taihou being shitposted came to mind. There's only one group of people talking shit about her.</br>  I don't like Kaga at all, her overall attitude annoys me, but for some reason I want to have hatesex with her.  <br>Watch it, I'm a Kagafag but I never shitpost on other girls especially Taihou. I always withdraw when you guys start arguing.</br>   (Me)<br>And you guys always attack every Kagafags on sight, you're the worse, mate</br>  <br> not her huge tits </br>  <br>Impregnation and mother making fetish.</br>  <br>None can dethrone dem Takao sisters.</br>  <br>I'm not into big tits, more of a small titsfag but Kaga makes them work or something.</br>    <br>I want to do naughty things to Shigure.</br>  Shigure smells like rain.

She actually got it first and the most among her CV sisters in midway. <br><br> We were coming down in all directions on the port side of the carrier.... I recognized her as the Kaga; and she was enormous.... The target was utterly satisfying.... I saw a bomb hit just behind where I was aiming.... I saw the deck rippling and curling back in all directions exposing a great section of the hangar below.... I saw [my] 500-pound bomb hit right abreast of the [carrier's] island. The two 100-pound bombs struck in the forward area of the parked planes.... </br></br></br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>You have pretty  good  taste.</br>  <br>Shit thread, even Stalker ignores faga thread</br>    <br> Well <br>You forgot your "ackchyually" after this neckbeard.</br></br>  <br>I want to hug Haruna</br>  <br>and translators, no one posts translation in your thread, Kagafags. You guys are part of problems</br>  <br>Maybe that's their plan. Using Kagaspams to get the thread kicked out of /a/.</br>  <br><br> Kancolle <br> small c </br></br></br>  <br>The ones who started the whole argument were the haters, so you're the other part of the problem.</br>  Best Yamato doujin?  <br> Ensign Takeshi Maeda, an injured Kaga B5N aircrew member rescued by Hagikaze, described the scene: "My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby. Even though I was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks, and everyone around me was crying; it was a very sad sight." </br>  So the last time I asked about your favourite pairings, but what about the ones you can't stand at all? Selfinsert pairings count as answers.  <br> autism </br>  Wannabe lady and wannabe praised.  <br>You and this thread.</br>  <br>Shitposters x this thread</br>  <br><br>Kaga is an example of a tragic heroin.</br></br>  <br> tragic heroin <br>Asanagi pls</br></br>  <br>Why do you hate yourself?</br>  <br>Akagi x Fubuki. I just can't understand how those who wrote the anime came up with it.</br>    <br>Not Asanagi but Kaga is seriously an interesting character</br>  <br>Hagikaze and Kaga interaction when?</br>  <br>After Hamakaze and Shinano.</br>  Hi guys, does the ability to launch seaplane bombers compensate for reduced firepower? Fusou/Yamashiro's remodel have reduced firepower but can launch seaplane bombers (other stats are increased too), is it worth it?    Subs and Seiran.    <br>There must be some huge fairies in there.</br>  <br> their <br>There is only one Kagaspammer and he's not a Kagafag</br></br>  <br>The Kagafag have multiple personalities.

When asked to post his first page sorted by ship level, he didn't post again. Not multiple personality?</br>  <br>That guy is more retarded than anti Kagafags</br>      <br>But that's hardly cancerous at all, yeah I remember that one from stupid Taihou vs Kaga argument, at least he married his Kongou</br>  <br>He could use his multiple personality to shitpost. He could be the Kagahater for all we know.</br>  http://apr.2chan.net/dec/60/src/143<wbr>6884428005.jpg</wbr>    <br>I'm wondering if it's better to wait until level 80 to remodel twice, rather than endure 60 levels of reduced firepower.</br>  <br>I refuse to believe someone like that being a Kagashitter because he's capable of making a decent argument, you can also call him a Kongoufag you know? Just admit that you guys are still salty at him</br>  <br>Just remodel them when you can. The reduced firepower is negligible as long as you don't sortie them to too advanced maps.</br>  <br>Consider the following: Yamashiro can achieve air superiority by herself with 5 destroyer or 4 DD/1SS escort in 3-2 or any map without enemy carriers and use that zuiun as artillery spotter. Reduced firepower isn't THAT terrible.</br>  <br>Zuikaku is better.</br>  <br>Kaga slap Zuikaku.jpg</br>  <br> making a decent argument <br>All he knows to say is "retard". <br><br>Don't forget that he turned tail and run instead of protecting Kaga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're better when they're together.</br>  <br>Just use any other BB when you're trying to clear shit and level Fusou and Yamashiro in PvP or in 3-2-A. The others BB are way better than the Fusous before lvl 80.</br>  <br>But that was me and I hate arguing. If only I can write English better or you guys keep false flagging me as 'that' ELS-kun.</br>  <br>Then try to stop those people from spam posting Kaga? Everyone is going to relate those spam as Kagafags.</br>    Abyssals will never get more backstory, will they? Not that they really need to, but it'd be nice.  <br>This mauposter<br> is the Kagaspammer, why you guys being this dense it makes me sad</br></br>  kaga is shit tbqh lads  <br>You really think the spammers are rational enough to be talked out of it? The only people who can stop that are the mods. But I'd expect the average anon to be rational enough not to group everything together under the blanket of xfags or let it influence their opinion of a character. It just begets more shitposting.</br>  The sempai factor  <br>It's Kaga pics. Who else but them?</br>  <br> m </br>  <br>sempai fi</br>    Dork is best though    I want an Atago nendoroid, is there ever going to be one?  <br>Beautiful Kaga</br>  I've fapped to many Kancolle sluts, but Kaga is always the one I come back to in the end.  <br>Fix </br>  <br>Best design.</br>  <br>What's wrong with that guy? He just stating his opinion</br>  <br>This guy gets it.</br>    Did I miss something or why is that outfit the new hot thing everywhere?<br><br>It looks cute on Kaga though.</br></br>  Should the devs introduce a human Admiral who defected in the past when he realized the Abyssals' ideals were right, and now fights for his Abyssal waifu? It would make you question your morality. Right now the canon is too clear-cut, humans = good guys, and Abyssals = bad guys.    <br>I don't why but Kaga looks lovely all the time.</br>  <br>Those posts are filling up 1/3 of the thread?</br>    <br>You can't assumed he is the same guy, we're all anon here</br>  Summer event soon!  <br>Even so, it's making him look bad just because he's part of the Kagafag gang.</br>   tfw you'll never hug Kaga and sniff her hair   <br>I can't hate another Kagafag, it feels very wrong. Sorry</br>  <br>Then there's no wrong in lumping you with them.</br>  <br>I am prepared to see KTKM-sama choke again.</br>  <br>Do as you please, I'm giving up.</br>  I want pictures.

I went to anime club in college sometimes. There was this one old bald man who'd shout things like, 'Take off the subtitles, I wanna see her tits.'<br>Yeah, I cringed.</br>  At my highschool was the Japanese club filled with weaboos. <br>During club exhibition day, the only thing on their booth was anime stuff like posters and merchandise. There were Bandai model kits of mobile suits from Gundam 00 and Gundam SEED. Nothing indicative of anything else 'Japanese' besides anime.<br> anon, join Japanese club!

I've mostly forgotten what we had, but I remember Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress and a One Piece movie.<br><br> College <br>I was in a Japanese course that also doubled as an anime club. Someone convinced me to watch Shana, it was shit.

The result was me swearing off the medium as a whole for 4 years. I was so disgusted by what I saw and heard in that classroom that even the idea that I would be associated with people like them was vomit inducing.</br>  <br>Naruto!<br>Naruto!<br>Believe it!<br>BELIEEEEVE IT!</br></br></br></br>      <br>I happened to rewatch this opening today because I had forgotten about it.<br><br>My bad</br></br></br>  <br>Nostalgia. Most of us had gotten into anime and from watching RTL2 as kids (and learned German along the way), and we still knew the verses.<br><br> Ich bin nur ein großer Träumer, doch ich weiss es kommt der Tag, irgendwann werden dann, meine Träume wahr... </br></br></br>  <br>And again.<br><br>Oha.</br></br></br>  <br>Well my mind set of joining our school anime club was this. <br><br>Since im a asian faggot that sorta resembles kpop stars, I would join the club and all the qtπs would fawn over my dick. So the mission to create my own harem began.<br><br>Club had about 10 girls and 5 guys. The guys were all disgusting like I expected but some had potential to be average. They just needed to fucking understand what personal hygiene was.<br><br>But boy I was wrong about the girls. None of them were fat but they all looked autistic as fuck. Dyed hair, shitty harry potteru glasses, wearing digimon beanies, you name it. Cutest girl was our prez but she was 7/10 on a good day.<br><br>First day we watch rolling girls but I couldnt even pay attention to half of the show because this kid with aspergers wouldnt shut the fuck up and go crazy every 10 seconds.<br><br>The girls be ugly as fuck by why not, I can still construct my harem. Channel my inner alpha and tell the kid to get the fuck out or shut the fuck up. Kid goes to a corner and quietly plays smash on his 3ds. Prez is obivously impressed and tells me "Thanks anon, we never figured out a way to deal with him and I couldnt kick him out either since hes autistic". <br><br>Eventually left the club because I got tired of toying with muh harem and everyone had shit taste. <br><br>Atleast I met a /r/anime fag that has decent taste so I have a person to talk about anime with other than /a/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy school shootings batman</br>    Yes, I went to a single session. It was maximum cringe.<br>A bunch of social washouts crowded in the moldy basement of a public library watching dubbed anime on a touchy overhead projector.<br>I joined the military the next day.<br>Ain't letting myself become like that.<br>Now I can watch shitty dubs on my laptop in the middle of sandy buttfuck derkastan like a normal person.</br></br></br></br>  <br>very good comrade anon</br>    <br>Thanks for bumping the thread, retard.</br>  <br>You're welcome.</br>  <br> bump </br>  <br>check my 5</br>    <br>/thread<br>Everyone who openly admits that he likes anime should kill himself.</br></br>    ayyyyy  <br>delete this</br>  <br><br><br><br>Where are all the black kids?</br></br></br></br>  Isn't Eris Lovely?
