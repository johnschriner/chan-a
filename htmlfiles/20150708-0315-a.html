[ Happy Birthday Kagami~n!<br><br>On this day Kagami turns  25 ! How does this make you feel?</br></br>  <br> 25 <br>oh god kill me already</br></br>   25   Merry Christmas!  They grow up so fast, don't they?   Lucky Star aired eight years ago.   <br>Underrated post.</br>  <br>   25 </br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Y3<wbr>5kLhst2Q</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>What age is Kagami in the manga now? Is she actually 25 or are they doing the floating timeline thing that Yotsuba has where the characters stay the same age regardless how long the manga has existed for?</br></br>  <br>No wonder people hardly talk about Lucky Star any more. It always had a barrier of having referential humour, but now all those references are 8 years old.</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL<br><br>Why does every jojo series start with one person doing a simple action that fucks over the whole story without reason?<br><br> Part1 <br>George Joestar is fucking trusting to a flaw. Even after Dario was obviously grave robbing him and stole his ring, and even had a letter detailing how he died, he still trusts and believes in Dio when he has the exact same sickness.<br><br> Part 2 <br>Straizo becomes a vampire and tries to kill joseph even though he already knows the pillarmen are awakening and that he is just food to them. He was the one who woke them up killing the speedwagon people in the first place, but just goes out to kill Joseph. Even if he succeeded he knew the Pillarmen were coming and that he didn't have hamon anymore, so the fuck was the point?<br><br> Part 3 <br>They take public a private boat but not a private plane? seriously if they just took a private plan with just Abdul, jotaro, kakyoin, and Joseph, only The Sun could have possibly stopped them from reaching Cairo in 1-2 days.<br><br> part 4  <br>Josuke could have easily healed Aya like he did Okuyasu at the end and found out who Kira was, but he just let her die. <br><br> part 5 <br>literally everything about Diavolo<br><br> Part 6 <br>Jotaro could have just time stopped and punched a hole through whitesnake. Star platinum is absolute in defending jotaro, so how the fuck did it not stop time and clutch the kill?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit writing.</br>  <br> Why does every jojo series start with one person doing a simple action that fucks over the whole story without reason? <br>Fate.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't Aya a set bomb at the time?</br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice pastebin OP<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br>  <br>I suppose that's true, the only reason why he got in the married life position was because the Morioh gang left him no other choice.<br><br>But still, it makes me think that, had his father not encouraged him to keep on being a psycopath, Kira would've been fine with some mental help.</br></br></br>  <br>either way, when she exploded Josuke could have just "fixed" her.</br>  <br>Goddamn, that looks like Doppelganger.</br>  I'm evil?  The song you're currently listening to (or the last one you had on) is the name of your Stand. What does it do?  Gay priest is here now    <br>Baka! I wasn't ready for you yet!</br>  <br>Fuck off with this austism standmaker shit.</br>  <br>El sacerdote homosexual a llegado.</br>  Is The World actually Jonathan's stand? It was his body DIO was using after all. What if Star Platinum might have been Jonathan's body and it was fighting its own spirit?  <br>FUCK OFF!!</br>  7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1&gt;6&gt;5  <br>aaaaarargghgrgfgh shut thhe fuck up aaaaa</br>  <br> *ha <br>Maricón</br></br>  <br> Knockin' on Heaven's Door <br>I guess I'm the best supporting character in the entire series.</br></br>  how can dio and jotaro fly do they ever explain that in the manga  <br><br><br>7&gt;4&gt;6&gt;2&gt;5&gt;3&gt;1</br></br></br>  <br> He can't fly <br>Woe is you, Anon</br></br>  I'm evil?  <br>Close.<br>4&gt;7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3</br></br>  <br>4&gt;6&gt;7&gt;2&gt;5&gt;3&gt;1</br>  <br><br>6&gt;7&gt;4&gt;3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;5<br> 5 has best crew tho </br></br></br>  <br>You're donut</br>  <br>I'm you?</br>  How can you seriously enjoy the OVA? It wasn't faithful to the manga at all. It's unwatchable for me.  <br>Only the N'Doul, D'Arby the Gambler, and Dio parts are good.</br>  Who is best JoJo and why is it Joseph?  <br>Josuke can't bring back the dead.</br>  <br> Who is best JoJo <br> Joseph. <br>That's not a dead Jojo.</br></br></br>  You now remember Avdol  <br><br>He didn't meet one jojo in his life.<br><br>He met a GIOGIO but not a jojo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being faithful to the part 3 manga shouldn't be considered an accomplishment.</br>  <br>Joseph can't even fix spaghetti</br>  <br>Giorno Giovanna is spelt Joruno Jobana in Japanese</br>  <br>He fixed Okuyasu and hayato with ease seconds after they blew up.</br>  <br> ORA </br>  JoJo is gay   40 posts <br> 14 posters <br> 80% recycled shitposts and memes <br><br>seriously, whats the point? Its all by one person.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2&gt;1&gt;4&gt;7&gt;5&gt;3&gt;6<br>Also hamon&gt;stand imho</br></br>  <br>Another thing that could fuck over the story.<br><br><br>Rohan could cured Kira.</br></br></br></br>  What if Alessi fought against Joseph instead and turned him young?<br><br>Imagine a young trickster Joseph against DIO, he would win immediately.</br></br>  <br>The real JoJo hater doesn't use capitals, you fake.</br>  <br>That's far to much shit taste for me to handle.</br>  Post yfw Soft &amp; Wet turns into  Crazy Queen/Killer Diamond  during the final battle with  Norisuke.   <br>Deal with it</br>  <br> Your next line is "The World" <br> THE WORLD <br>And then he throws a knife at his neck and he dies</br></br></br>  Can someone shoop DIO and Pucci in this pic?    <br>Not really, he would have loss Hermit Purple and so he couldn't have fought The World.</br>  <br> Okay. </br>  <br>If he killed the ultimate life form...</br>  DO YOU UNDERSTANDOOOOO<br><br>YARE YARE DAZEEEEE</br></br>  H O T P A N T S<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't do that either, even with maxed out luck and rolling numerous 20s.</br>  Is Shizuka actually dead or what? Because at this rate, the Colored guys are going to finish translating Part 5 before Shizuka makes any progress.  <br>He didn't. Cars never died and the volcano was what send Cars out to space. Joseph just distract him at the right moment.</br>  <br>Then why are you complaining to yourself?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> eventually there will be so many memes that every single post is a meme and JoJo will just be meme threads nonstop, being created and filled with memes until they 404 and the next thread being made to repost those same memes <br> eventually it will overflow so dual meme threads will need to be balanced and recreated  <br> eventually /a/ will just be a meme board </br></br></br>  im evil?  <br>Valentine was right.</br>  <br>guys i just started reading diamond is unbreakible after watching stardust crusaders<br><br>its really boring for me so far and it seems to be going nowhere unlike part 3 the only character i like is okuyasu, does it get better?</br></br></br>  Reminder that Part 4 anime will never happen. They included a Part 3 teaser at the end of 2012 but they didn't do it this time.<br><br>They'll probably skip to Part 5.</br></br>    <br>A shame because I fucking loved his translation. How far in are the colored guys?</br>  <br>Heaven, my child.</br>  <br>Cool gif but can it beat Enrico Pucci? And I'm not talking about just church boy Enrico Pucci. No, I'm not talking Whitesnake soul stealing jizz mode can make a mans head play gospel, can make a frog fly away and explode and stick his hand in someone and control them sleeps in bed with DIO , Let's DIO plow his ass, I can't wait for heaven DIO is just so sexy I'm a 39 year old in a black Italian twink's body with a huge black girl ass Enrico Pucci. I'm talking about finding 38 sinners and turning DIO's bone into a green baby then making it fuse with Whitesnake after reciting the 14 words (Spiral,staircase,Rhinoceros beetle,Ruins street,Fig tart,Rhinoceros beetle,Via dolorosa,Rhinoceros beetle,Singularity point,Giotto,Angel,Hydrangea,Rhinoc<wbr>eros beetle,Singularity point,Secret emperor .) Then travels to Cape Canaveral Air force station gaining the power over gravity and the stand C-moon causing, floats into mid-air and attains Heavens and kills everyone speeding up non-living things, while gaining the power of super speed, and resets the universe killing everyone Enrico Pucci. </wbr> </br>  Who would win in a fight, DIO or Diavolo? Do you think timeskip could be erased?  I hate how you guys turned my favorite villain into a meme.  jojo is gay  <br>It gets better when Kira appears.</br>  <br>Who? DIO?</br>  <br>Been while since I've seen this gif.</br>  we never woke up  Is Pucci the best example of how fucked super speed is in fiction?<br><br>He killed everyone with almost zero effort despite going against a time stopper with the equivalent of Substitute from Pokemon and the only reason that he lost was the side effect of speeding up the entire fucking universe alongside him<br><br>Compared to people like the Flash or Quicksilver who constantly get beaten by banana peels and shit, it seems a lot better written</br></br></br></br>  <br>DIO can only be defeated by the power of bullshit protagonism.</br>    <br> How many times have we had this again? <br>If they use their Stands at the same time then the stopped time will be erased resulting in nothing.<br>Whoever uses it first wins.</br></br></br>  <br>Jojo is manly, show me a single panel of two men having sex with each other.</br>  <br>DIO wins. Then he'd fuck Doppio while Diavolo watches.</br>  anyone have the ALIVE part 7 MAD?  Josuke will travel to the SBRverse shortly.  <br>don't you mean SBR josefumi will go to the original universe and save young Josuke?</br>  I hope mods give us a sticky to discuss the new episode.<br><br>They gave one to fucking kill la kill.</br></br>  What would Jonathan say to his descandants?  <br>Not this shit again.</br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm159<wbr>20014</wbr></br>  <br>You aren't gay enough to be a meme.</br>  <br>Hold on, couldn't a death inside Death 13 be an even worse death than Diavolo? If someone were trapped in a Death 13 nightmare and someone else kills them outside the nightmare, they'd be stuck in that nightmare forever right?</br>  <br> epitaph sees time stop <br> skips time <br> nothing in the skipped time happens <br> DIO's time stop has no cooldown because he never used it <br> but time skip and epitaph does <br> DIO stops time <br> punches a hole through Diavolo <br><br>aaaaaand were done here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Josuk- I mean Josefumi is here now.  <br>"Jojo was a mistake."</br>  <br> This is true heaven </br>  <br> new episode </br>  <br>No, not really. Professor Zoom and Hunter Zolomon Zoom are better examples and Professor Zoom mostly time traveled.</br>  <br>You don't think when you're dead.</br>  <br>you fucked up Pucci!!!<br>i didnt use a picture in my post!</br></br>  can someone post the that's bullshit but i believe it colored?  <br>Timeskip can be erased but Epitaph would only see DIO teleporting and instantly gibbing Diavolo<br><br>There's nothing Diavolo can really do even after Epitaph since DIO will probably timestop after King Crimson activates and he becomes disoriented</br></br></br>  Someone post the Doc D'Arby edit.  Can anyone please explain why everyone is so obsessed with Pucci?  <br> P-Padre gay? </br>  <br>Didn't Professor Zoom get impaled by a fucking sword while monologuing? How does someone with the reaction time required to see light particles move get stabbed?</br>  H O T P A N T S<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gay Priest catches groceries.</br>  <br>By not paying attention.  He had to die somehow so that Flashpoint can be undone. </br>  <br>Good to see nothing has changed after all these years.</br>  can someone post a stream link?  is it friday yet  「MADE IN STAR KILLER KING PLATINUM CRIMSON WORLD HEAVEN QUEEN」 is here now  <br>He was backstabbed. He can see light particles move but doesn't have eyes in his back.</br>  Reminder that Kakyoin died without anyone knowing he defeated Death 13  <br>This needs an update of newer memes.</br>  <br>That's a shitty png</br>  <br>"Why you don't use hamon?"</br>  <br>I killed you?</br>  <br>Jesus christ how horrifying</br>  <br>So wouldn't he be able to feel the tip on the blade entering his back before it gets anywhere near hitting something fatal?</br>  Just fuck already.  So I recently just finished the Part 2 manga and I'm on SC now. Are Stands permanent? This shit is pretty boring to be honest. Also does Jotaro ever get interesting?  <br>Please calm down mr. Newfag</br>  <br>Considering Gappy's balls are like a pool table, I don't think he should take the risk.</br>  <br> Pucci kills Jotaro. </br>  H O T P A N T S<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why didn't Fugo go with the rest of the group? Why was he the only one who was afraid when he had the best power out of all of them at that point?  <br>Yes and no.</br>  <br>Why didn't Joseph just destroy DIO's body with Hamon after he was killed by Jotaro?</br>  Isn't it funny that they're the opposite when push comes to shove?<br><br>Diavolo is a complete nutjob most of the time, clinically paranoid while DIO puts on this cool and charismatic facade that attracts people to him.<br><br>But when Diavolo fights he don't fuck around, so if we exclude Giorno, every person who has faced him died. He killed them, he didn't play around but instead was straight to the point. Diavolo seems very calm during his fights, analyzing while DIO, goes full ham and starts going crazy, making these faces and hammy speeches.<br><br>I feel like DIO's the more appealing, functional and charismatic leader, while Diavolo is the far more unstable yet competent leader</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because his stand was OP as hell. Araki literally came out saying he had to write him out because he would have ruined the later fights. <br><br>Either way his stand was just recycled for green day.</br></br></br>  <br>Diavolo = italian for devil<br><br>Dio = spanish for God<br><br>woooooooooooooow</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that Diavolo isn't a competent leader at all, part 5 is literally just him digging himself a deeper grave.</br>  <br> reading manga when anime improved everything <br>Yes, they are permanent.<br>Jotaro got interesting after Part 3.<br>SC is the most boring part so far but it have good battles.</br></br></br></br>  Why is Weather Report such an underrated stand? Every time the "strongest stand" or "X vs Y" comes up it always turns into a debate about King Crimson, The World/SP, MiH, D4C, GER, etc.<br>Weather Report fucks up Pucci's shit not once, not twice, but THREE times, ultimately killing him without a whole lot of effort after he single handed curb-stomped the entire cast. Being able to control the weather and elements is insanely powerful, and the oxygen attack would kill just about any opponent regardless of how broken their stand ability is. I don't care how much time KC erases or how much bullshit GER is, it won't matter when Weather Report paralyzes them and then smashes their head into paste.</br>  The most cancerous JoJofags are those that hate Part 6 with an inexplicable passion. None can compare to the degrees of shitposting and buttmad these faggots exude, whenever someone implies that part 6 is good.<br>Prove me wrong.</br>  <br>To be fair, how would KC deal with poisonous gases? It's not like he can "evade" them or "erase" the time when The Boss gets intoxicated, because even if he does he's still going to end up being poisoned.<br> That's the problem, it is useless against people who know who he is. <br>Have you read the page posted though? They perfectly know who he is, but he is still able (or, rather, gained an ability) to control and activate it freely and manually.</br></br></br>  <br>Dio is italian for God.<br>Dios es "god" en español.</br></br>  So the shitposter aside who doesn't know the difference between MiH and BtD, whats everyone opinions on the Eyes of heaven lineup?<br><br>I wonder if they are gonna reveal a large amount of early part 4 in anticipation for the anime or if they'll just keep milking 3.</br></br>  <br>The most cancerous JoJofags are those that love Part 6 with an inexplicable passion. None can compare to the degrees of shitposting and buttmad these faggots exude, whenever someone implies that part 6 isn't good.<br>Prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br> 666 <br>Oh lawd</br></br>  <br>you just need to open up to stands more. araki was able to do much more with them than hamon.</br>  <br>Because Weather Report is asspull in stand form.</br>  <br>I just did. You responded.</br>    <br> JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All Star Battle OST: A True Warrior, Wham <br>It gives me the power to awaken my masters,  before they go-go </br></br>  <br>Because it was more dramatic to wait to the morning.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZUi<wbr>0L28WJyc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>well its only obvious the anime is overhauling the game ie jotaro default outfit is now black and grey and not blue and purple<br>but i think theyll add in the other ones left out like Hot pants, FF, maybe santana?<br>if they can make water guy from part 3 work then they can do just about anything</br></br></br>  <br>Because reset to 0 is the most broken power in any piece of work</br>  <br> Stand Ability <br><br>It's punches stop time, setting you up the bomb for kill after 10 seconds, but then it skips that 10 seconds after leaving stopped time, then it accelerates time after you explode so you die faster. <br><br>Then it goes back in time and does it to you again.</br></br></br></br></br>  What's his name again?  <br>joey jojo</br>   tfw we will never get to see kira joestar's predeath and Joseph 2.0 adventures   <br>Religious man of ambiguous race-san</br>  <br>Queer Pope.</br>  <br>faggot cure</br>  Will Gappy get a partner in EoH?  <br>It's amazing how screwed Dio would be by even his early tricks, like increasing local air pressure. <br><br>Road roller style shenanigans are his only chance against even that, and either Dio has some trouble lifting things that heavy, or he's sexually excited by knives or something.</br></br></br>  <br>wasn't that kekyoin's theme song?<br><br><br>mrw i don't care</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yasuho</br>  <br> wasn't that kekyoin's theme song? <br>kek.</br></br>  <br>i thought that pucci was gay</br>  <br>He'll be getting in that rose garden eventually but it'll be either right before of right after the last fight.</br>  <br>Yasuho is the final boss you dip.</br>  <br>Alt universe Pucci is a straight atheist.</br>  Does Josuke just not care that Joshuu is a literal rapist or is he just unaware of how much of a freak he really is?  <br>He doesn't care  because he is also a rapist. </br>  Reminder that the first JoJo was Jesus  <br>someone didnt read SBR</br>  But why is Karera so cute?  <br>Josuke doesn't know what happened, and Joshuu is just such a dumb motherfucker he genuinely thought she wanted it.</br>  <br>Honestly the couple of times Jesus showed up it was a bit horrifying for me.</br>  quick /a/!  <br>Who do you think Saint was before he was turned into the Corpse Parts?</br>  http://gigamaker.jimdo.com/<br><br>Something to play with.<br><br>Here's a kekyoin I didn't make.</br></br></br></br>  <br> resets the universe killing everyone <br>Nobody died during the reset</br></br>  <br>What was the answer?</br>  <br>D</br>  <br>In that case, during.</br>  <br>I once did something similar to a girl. <br><br>I had to threaten her with violence to keep her whore mouth shut.</br></br></br>  Are the fighting games welcome?

And he was a super hamon user like Straizo...</br></br></br>  <br>Part 6 is my favorite and Jotaro jobs hard in it.</br>  <br>He almost killed Wham and therefore accomplished nothing</br>    <br>Good taste.</br>  I'm reading part 6, i have a question.<br><br>Is Pucci gay?</br></br>  <br>At least he was close, unlike Dire.</br>  <br> dio stops time <br> put his fist through diavolos head <br> time resumes <br> kc is already dead like his master <br> no more kc shit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>shit yeah best jotaro<br>great taste</br></br>  <br>i'm hoping for Red hot chili peppers and bad company. <br><br>Chocolate disco would be great given the arena nature of the game.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm fucking loving it<br>i doubt it now, but i'd kill for alessi<br><br>well i doubt they'd cut akira</br></br></br></br>  I just got done reading part 5. Jesus christ what a shitty ending.What a shitty part overall really. Only characters I really liked were Diavolo and Mista.<br> Also I'm still not sure I understand KC. Why doesn't Diavolo do more stuff like he did against Metallica where he let the bullets phase through him by erasing time? Is it an inconsistency?  </br>  <br>Part V felt like it was missing a lot of inbetween things, which I guess is ironic considering the nature of King Crimson. <br>The entire thing reminded me of how Dio's World felt rushed near the end, like Araki was setting up the fight to go on a whole nother chapter but then got rushed or something so just ended it quick. <br>All of Part V feels like that to me. Maybe it was a theme to go with King Crimson, or a gag that I'm not getting like Part 8 having Jo2uke constantly dodging plot hooks, but I didn't like it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess you two don't have the volumes.</br></br>  <br>Separate content, separately judged.</br>  <br> I really liked were Diavolo <br>He was the worst character on part 5.</br></br>  <br>More like his stand was poorly thought out. Depending on the time of the day, it's either extremely useful or really useless, not to mention that it's an enormous collateral damage risk. It's just a shit stand outside of its design. Araki could have written 2 ways to deal with him: he gets sniped by a ranged stand user, or Diavolo stealths and punches through him or impales him somewhere, like what happened with Narancia. Either would be pretty shit, taking him out of the story altogether was the right decision. GD is a much more interesting Stand than PH but you couldn't use it as a protagonist stand.<br><br><br>Because the fanbase is retarded and doesn't understand that fights between complex Stands would basically be like the high tier 2hus fighting to the death. To talk about the outcome you'd have to make comparisons between various vaguely understood concepts, based on extremely limited circumstantial observation of those concepts in action (and sometimes, actually based on nothing). It would only be conjecture at the end.<br>As far as I can remember, WR was normally talked about as one of the most powerful Stands, but I guess the final bosses became memes when JoJo became popular and WR has been forgotten. GER-wankery of course existed since Part 5 ended and it's been so strong that the fanfiction that's been established about it is now taken as actual fact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Araki literally came out saying he had to write him out because he would have ruined the later fights. <br>No he didn't, that's something fans made up. What Araki did say is that he planned for Fugo to be a mole for Diavolo, but felt he'd be letting his young readers down so he decided to get rid of him instead.</br></br>  So do any of you fags have any figures?  The paste has been removed.<br><br>Also, where can I find the colored scans for part IV after Kishibe Rohan's adventure? Batoto has the colored scans only up to that point.</br></br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br>OP posted a broken link</br></br>  <br>What do you mean? Do you mean the fan translations?</br>  <br>the volumes. in japanese r the translated ones.</br>  <br>6&gt;7&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1&gt;5</br>  <br>7&gt;2&gt;5&gt;3&gt;4&gt;1&gt;6</br>    <br>I'm guessing he just wasn't ready for it at the time. Later on, he was more prepared for any of Kira's shenanigans.</br>  <br>Josuke had potential but the end of part 4 really left me disappointed<br><br>He played second fiddle to Jotaro at the last minute<br><br>And him stealing Joseph's wallet like a faggot punk left a bad taste in my mouth</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He did it for the photo his mother wanted, he's so pure</br>  <br>Cutest JoJo is always purest JoJo.</br>  <br> no pyjama alt costume in ASB </br>  <br>is that [THE ROCK] ???</br>  <br> he played second fiddle to Jotaro at the last minute <br>You know, until now I've never really looked at it like that. A fair amount of fights involve working together, like when Koichi and Jotaro run into Kira. Besides, Jotaro just finished him off. Josuke is the one who fucked his shit up.<br>Only thing I could want more out of part 4 is more Okuyasu action.</br></br></br>  <br> Josuke is the one who fucked his shit up. <br>Josuke was about to get killed by an air bubble before Okuyasu and then everyone else showed up.<br><br>The entire final fight really belonged to Hayato.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The pacing in the manga was so much better. It feels so unnatural in the anime.</br>  <br>So pure</br>   Mista Guido's stand is the exact same as Hol Horse's stand except better   <br> part 4 <br> not Okuyasu gigantic fuckup </br></br>  Since Gappy has four balls doesn't it make him jizz master just like in my singaporean wood carvings?  <br>Who is the kid standing between Rohan and Giorno?</br>  <br>Mista's Stand is not a gun.</br>  <br>Mista is a thug while Hol Horse is assassin. Of course Mista's stand would just about spraying around. Hell, his stand isn't even a gun.</br>  <br> emperor = just a pistol. <br> mista = little automated stands that are used along with a real pistol <br>Yeah exact same</br></br></br>  <br>He was just a coward and had no control over his stand</br>  <br>Fugo had ridiculous stand considering he was just a puny coward. Stand that kills every living thing around it in 30 seconds? That's fucking Vanilla Ice tier soul he has.</br>  <br> except better <br>Really nigger? Hol Horse has infinite bullets and can't miss. Mista's stand is just a far depowered harvest,it sucks hard.</br></br>  <br>No,that would be Polnareff</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GvF<wbr>90NJS-84</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Speedwagon, he was a criminal and then became an ally, also they got the scar</br>  So you get teleported to part 6 of jojo, how would you kill pucci? carbomb? shive him while hes weak from fusing with the green baby/  <br> Implying I wouldn't help him. </br>  I know we have a lot of "whos the most op" circlejerks here, but is there anyone who could realistically kill or much less harm the green baby?<br><br>Everything coming close to him just gets divided in half and then once it touches him will be erased. Not even GER could do anything because as he closed into range to do something he'd just get halved until eventually being erased.<br><br>Green Grass of Home is the most unbeatable stand there is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> d'arby beats him by playing super mario kart  <br>Fugo could probably beat him, Risotto too</br></br>  <br> d'arby <br>The baby has to say I beat my soul. Pretty sure thats not gonna happen for 3+ years<br><br> fugo <br>inanimate objects shrink too as seen with the rock, so even a haze cloud at night activated from a distance would just shrink and hit zero point before it infected the baby.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if you used za warudo to stop time and get close to it, would it still shrink you?</br>  <br>seems like the power of the green paradox is a constant, so just like how magnets still work in time stop, so would the baby's stand.</br>  <br>That guy from part 5 who fucks shit up if it's lower than him, all he has to do is climb a tree or some shit</br>  <br> Not even GER could do anything <br>Reset to zero. No matter what it is. GER is not only the strongest Stand but also the strongest in anything.<br>But Giorno is shit so it balances out.</br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't GER work? His stand just wouldn't let Giorno to shrink</br>  <br>He loves Dio the way he loves God<br><br>So yes</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>has to be in gold experience's range to attack and "zero" the baby. And his range is halved every time he tries to approach the baby.</br></br></br>  Rock Men &gt; Pillar Men  <br><br><br> how does GER work? </br></br></br>  <br>I'll do it, but let me the time to procrastinate first</br>  <br>Rock man?</br>  <br>The effect hit giorno, The effect is turned by zero by GER, is fucking simple to understand</br>  <br/>  Anybody ever notice that these threads are pretty much the same thing over and over?  <br> Mold produces <br> baby at lower altitude <br> mold tries to get towards baby in potential lower altitude <br> halves every time it tries to get closer <br> mold hits zero point and vanishes <br><br>Baby wins.<br><br><br>Like KC, we don't know enough about GER to know if that is how it works or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I blame GER</br>  <br> BITES THE DUST </br>  <br> Not even GER could do anything because as he closed into range to do something he'd just get halved until eventually being erased. <br>That depends on whether the effect is active because of the baby's will, it's implied that the halving is automatic and the disintegration-on-touch is volitional. GER doesn't have the power to reset any and all actions to 0, it only has the power to reset volitional actions to 0. But of course you can't explain that to geniuses like  who think fandom is canon.<br>Stands that are purely physical can't do anything to GGoH, but what about Stands like Cream, which is not material as long as Ice stays inside the other dimension? Does the baby's powers affect any and all matter (doubtful), or is it just about "things that approach it" specifically (I can't remember if it was stated anywhere that it works specifically against threats)? What about Weather Report's atmospheric shenanigans?</br></br></br>  <br>GER acts a direct counter to any ability. If he was to face the baby he would double is height everytime he would be shrinked or the shrinking wouldn't work at all.<br>Green Day could also beat him, I guess.</br></br>  <br> GER doesn't have the power to reset any and all actions to 0 <br>It does. He already had this argument yesterday, in the italian translation is clearly stated it's power is to turn will, action, and power to zero.</br></br>  <br>its*</br>  <br> he would double is height everytime he would be shrinked <br>How did GER turn into this</br></br>  <br>Again, GER act as specif counter to any ability thus turning it to zero. During the fight with Diavolo it counters the time skip by "rewinding the deleted time". These are the actual words used by Diavolo.</br>  <br>Meant for</br>  <br><br><br>Risotto &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all</br></br></br>  <br>Do you think Josuke ever found love before MiH?</br>  Anybody ever notice that these threads are pretty much the same thing over and over?  http://goanimate.com/videos/0L3F1y_<wbr>zbne0</wbr>    <br>That's the fate of generals <br> inb4 gay priest joke </br></br>  <br><br>Well first off the baby is made of tree shit so its not gonna have iron like a human, but just for shits and giggles:<br><br> manipulates iron via stand <br> stand tries to go towards baby to manipulate its iron <br> shrinks as it goes to reach baby <br> hits zero point <br><br>Also his stand only works from 10 meters away, so he'd have to get shrunk to even get in range.<br><br>I think only GER, grateful dead(if the baby can even age), Lock, C-moon(via throwing it 3km by gravity) and maybe Cream could even do anything to the baby</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stand tries to go towards baby to manipulate its iron <br>I don't think his stands needs to reach the baby,it only needs to be 10m distant to trigger the iron transformation</br></br>  <br>Yes, and it's clearly talking about volitional actions unless you're able to put 2 and 2 together.<br>http://matome.naver.jp/odai/2142848<wbr>390436192701<br>http://note.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/<wbr>detail/n92557<br>Just two examples showing that the Japanese fans themselves don't think that GER's power are clearly defined and that nothing can necessarily defeat him. In discussions they very frequently bring up the fact that his powers haven't been clearly displayed at all, and that there's a big question mark concerning whether it can function independently of volition or not. You can google for more discussions and analyses on GER that aren't based on wankery.<br><br>"GER's powers are clear and it's been established beyond any doubt that he can reset everything to 0 and has no weak points" is bullshit concocted by western fans who were delighted to have a heavy hitter from JJBA to post on powerlevel discussions. People even used to claim that GER's powers worked infinitely towards the past and the future and were beyond timefuckery (without any basis whatsoever, as you'll surely confirm), and then Killer Queen vs GER happened in ASB.</br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>    <br>If Zepelli had decided to take Tonpetty's advice and not learned Hamon, everyone everywhere would have been fucked.<br><br>It balances out.</br></br></br>  <br>Easy there sonic the edgehog</br>  <br>Assuming in that case that Dio won against Jonathan, how would it turn out against the pillar men?</br>  <br>Pillar Men would eventually wake up, and vampires ain't shit against them.</br>  <br>We're going the way of HSG.

I didn't want to see them go.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I loved Nyaruko (Kuuko best girl, though), but F was a plain bad way to end the series.</br>  <br>Two hours until the NTR doujins</br>  <br>Probably my biggest gripe with F is including a character who only showed up in the Flash series without any explanation of who she was. I hadn't watched very much of the flash series when I saw F, so I was confused until I looked it up.</br>  Almost time to see how crazy Yuu will be in this.  <br>A new Hestia? even though more art is always welcome, I don't like the idea of more meme waifus.</br>  <br>pls no, the last thing I need is monstergirls in the hands of normalfags.</br>  <br>Jews</br>   No nippples  <br>BD release when?</br>  So any of you fags gonna stream this?  <br>Read the thread.</br>  <br> not wanting to touch fluffy tail <br>Also I had to upload it to Facebook messenger then download it and reupload from my phone ;-;</br></br>  <br>I have its noonei s answering whether http://komica.yucie.net/boardcast/a<wbr>69e373.php is yucie?</wbr></br>  <br>I'll give you a hint.

Your patience with fags like us is admirable.</br>  <br>I have Premium, and I can't find anything about this show on the site.</br>  Guys it's on both channels according to the monmusu site.<br><br>So either VG3 or Douyo will do.</br></br>  <br>than wtf is this talking bout http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/2<wbr>17236/20150705/monster-musume-anime<wbr>-release-date-crunchyroll.htm</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>The page will be set online when the episode is on the site.

It would be like needing subs for Hellsing Ultimate.</br></br>  <br>There is no fucking stream where I can watch it? all what anon posted here was just assumptions.</br>    <br> waking up every morning next to Miia </br>  <br>That sounds like me after any food related holiday.</br>  MONSTA<br>MONSTA<br>MON<br>MON<br>MON<br>MONSTA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot a MON there. 4/10</br>  <br>Speaking of the OP, I know that an anon on these threads preordered both the OP and the ED off of Amiami. Did anybody else do the same?<br> and if they did, can they upload it to YT when they get the full version? </br></br>  <br> MONSTA <br>I keep hearing it as MONSTARS and I want to see them playing basketball.</br></br>  <br>Honestly I would be really disappointed if there wasn't a basketball chapter eventually.</br>  oh, Overlord's on<br><br>I see threads about that all the time, but I have no idea what it's about</br></br>  this shit is going to flop. it looks so bad in the anime.  <br>It's about an MMORPG which has been shut down, except for one player. The rest are NPC's. <br><br>I might go watch that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why does this shit need to be a second language?</br></br>  Lala's legs.  WHERE IS?  <br>MONSUTAA is the next BRAVE SHIIINE</br>  <br>You're a fucking pleb.</br>  <br>You're the pleb, lala's legs are 10times that of Smith.</br>  <br>Does Lala's body have a separate personality to her head or not?</br>  <br><br> being a filthy humie lover </br></br>  <br>only if theyre seperate</br>  HOW MUCH TIME UNTIL I CAN MASTURBATE TO MIIA!!!!    <br>Lala's body displays her true feelings.</br>  <br> HOW MUCH TIME UNTIL I CAN MASTURBATE TO MIIA!!!! <br>30min</br></br>  <br>OH, NO WONDER I COULDN'T FIND IT, NONE OF YOU FAGS SAID THAT SHIT DOESN'T SHOW UP ON FIREFOX</br>  <br>34 minutes</br>  <br>about 35 minutes.</br>  <br>36 minutes</br>  <br> OH, NO WONDER I COULDN'T FIND IT, NONE OF YOU FAGS SAID THAT SHIT DOESN'T SHOW UP ON FIREFOX <br>What do you mean? I use Firefox.</br></br>   douyu not working <br><br>shit</br></br>  <br>37 Minutes.</br>  <br>Just do it like I'm doing and just do it now<br><br> not having a folder dedicated to lewd pictures of Miia <br><br>It's the only thing I masturbate to</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people in firefox can't see the channel selector button things. Not everyone, just some people.<br><br>It might be a specific version or add-on in FireFox.</br></br></br>  Why does Lala have blue skin? Is she a demon or something?  <br>She's a dullahan, like that one girl from Durarara!!.<br>Think the headless horseman, but from ancient Celtic mythology.</br></br>  Wow this Yucie is a easily triggered faggot<br>Banned me for nothing.<br>Thank god I have 2 IPs</br></br>  Already saw the ep, ask me anything.  <br>Nigga, Ive been waiting for this shit for the past 3 years<br>I never thought it wouldve gotten a localization, let alone an anime release<br><br>VR waifus, giant robot fights, and a monster girl anime<br>What a time to live in</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why does Lala have blue skin? Is she a demon or something? <br>She is probably meant to have white skin, but pure white doesn't work for manga so she gets a blue tint. Much like black hair gets purple tint.</br></br>  Just wondering, is the "coming to crunchyroll" page is often wrong or has everyone been talking shit  <br>does it have monster girls?</br>  stream where?  So its on channel VG3 yes?  <br>Yes, plenty.</br>  All girls are best girls  <br>does it have nudity?</br>  i-is there slime girls?  <br> Not already masturbating so that you can last longer during the show. </br>  <br>No nipples.</br>  <br>yes, censored to death though</br>  Where are people watching it live?  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<wbr>HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH CAN'T FUCKING WAIT FOR A HUGE WHITE SCREEN WITH MIIA'S SCENES</wbr>   http://komica.yucie.net/boardcast/a<wbr>69e373.php</wbr> <br><br> I hope you fags are ready for monmusu in half an hour </br></br>  http://vaughnlive.tv/neetball<br>your welcome<br> Suck my dick, wilson </br></br>  <br>thank you based spider</br>  <br> My faggot dick is ready anon. We MonMusu very soon. </br>  <br>Remember to pick channel V3. It is the same as </br>  Who is that Drag00n guy? He seems like a cool guy.  <br><br>You are two fucking faggots</br></br>  <br>Fuck of drag00n</br>  Wait, I thought God eaters was delayed by a week, what's this?  <br>But the Cell guy is  perfect. </br>  <br>It's episode 00 special a.k.a the old shit 5 years ago</br>  We're down to 18 minutes, everybody.<br>Get hype.</br>  <br><br>Thanks faggots, now their channels are going to be taken down all because of you.</br></br>   cc loves Public Sex   Laser can suck a baquette   First episode tomorrow. Let's keep this thread going till then.<br><br>Cautiously optimistic for Papa Bones.</br></br>  <br>Where will the episode end?</br>                <br>New xhapter up at Batoto</br>  <br>any chance he'll be matched by someone with high agility in the source of the adaptation?</br>  <br>Did you forget Volume 3 anon?</br>  <br>sorry potential secondary here</br>  <br> be matched <br>as of yet no, unless you count the servants</br></br>  <br>Yes, it'll probably be in the last episode of the show.</br>  <br><br><br>I see<br><br> as of yet no, unless you count the servants <br><br> Judging by what the anon said I assume one of the servants is going to turn on him? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sense of justice: -500 <br>Wasn't Ainz just a normal office employee pre-Yggdrasil or did turning into an Undead cripple whatever morality he has along with his emotions?</br></br>  <br>Yes it's   the penguin  </br>  <br>likely his setting on his Character, it also seem to have an effect on his overall personality, as he just regards humans as small animals.</br>  <br>Any fansub group planing to do this?</br>  Waiting for dat Albedo.  <br> you'll never have Albedo's mountains pushed against you </br>  So what are the spoilers for vol 9  The official book seems to have a few more facial expressions.        It's pages like these that makes me think they're really cutting corners on the skeletons.  <br>I wish there was more art on the different floors, that's not half bad as far as secret underground undead lairs go.</br>  <br><br>RIP Quality</br></br>  I wish someone would write a pasta about how the game stuff disappears after the first episode so we can direct the inevitable "Game? It's shit" comments to the pasta.   yet another LN adaptation about a vr game  <br>Literally who gives a fuck</br>  <br><br>Great.</br></br>  So I'm not sure how to feel about the OP.<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>51028</wbr></br></br>  <br> Do you have a way of getting past all those undead? <br> ITS RIGHT HERE <br>goddamn it, this scene is so manly</br></br></br>  So, now that there will be inevitable anime shitposters, can we agree to have a nice LN only thread on Saturdays that chapter is released? I will missed the comfy spooky thread.    <br>Don't worry. Anime shitposters will decrease in quantity after the first episode. Because they would have hopefully dropped it by then.</br>  <br>I kinda liked it, but i hated de cgi staff.</br>  <br>I dont think thats the OP. It's more like just the song for the OP and combine all videos from the trailers and pv</br>  <br>I think I like it better than their Parasyte OP but it definitely grows on you I think. I only hope the visuals in it are better than the song.</br>  <br>Oh, that's what I meant. The OP song.</br>  <br>I think that's the OP but not the accompanying visuals.</br>  <br>What the hell is up with anime using CGI for everything recently</br>  <br>Cant wait to see Papa Bones and his bony adventures</br>  <br>It's a lot cheaper, I heard.</br>  <br>It's cheaper. Or so I hear</br>  <br>I want her to rape me and stomp on my worthless human dick with narbarel</br>    Can someone make the webm where Ainz sees Albedo's profile and then covers his mouth?    <br>I expected her ranger skills to be at least level 10, rather than a measly 5.</br>  <br>Hmm the small cuts showed us the Black Knight trouncing around and footage of the Primal Fire Elemental.<br><br>If they go for 3 episodes per volume, ch1/2, ch3 and cliffhanger on gazef, rest for 3rd ep. I'd wish they'd go for 4 to allow more pre-translocation world building and shit that got cut in the manga, mainly more of the interlude, epilogue and Ainz's negotiations in Carne.</br></br></br>  <br> ranger <br> use whip <br>Whats the point?</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like episode 1 will just end at the part where the guardians finish their bowing.</br>  <br>Probably something she picked up from her Tamer classes. Then again, she has another 70 levels unaccounted for so who knows what it really might be from.</br>  <br>Ainz guildmate set up the settings and level for all the guardians. They probably pick that class and level for certain skill, tracking or hiding.</br>    <br>Ainz only set up Pandora's Actor.<br><br><br>So they aren't going to rush it? That's good news, I guess.</br></br></br></br>          Where's it going to stream?      <br> young </br>  <br>well, technically she's only about as old as the others, give or take a few years.</br>     Not really interested in another MMO story but the skeleton MC might be cool <br> Decide to read the manga chapters since it's coming out tomorrow <br> MC is serious business and doesn't play around <br> MMO stuff is merely the introduction, story is fully inmersed in the setting <br> Minimal pandering, pretty much reduced to Albedo and Shalltear, not that it matters much when Momonga is undead (though I'm prepaed for it to go full harem anyway) <br> That black knight mode <br> That hamster <br><br>Picked the fuck up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the manga </br>  <br>Well she was born when Peroroncino created her so she couldn't have been alive that long. Plus, she only gained sentience a short while ago.</br>  <br> the manga </br>  Why does Ainz have such a large crotch guard? It literally goes down to his knees.   all the CGI in the preview <br>Ughhhhhhhhh.</br>  <br><br><br>I know there's a novel but this was quicker and I like the pretty pictures, I'll get to read the rest later.</br></br></br>  <br>Albedo has to protect the most important part of Lord Ainz of course, those skeletons aren't gonna make themselves.</br>  <br>Well maybe they actually could</br>  Well hopefully we can get like 20+ volumes out of this series. I also hope other players start showing up, I mean like bad news for Ainz kind of players.  <br>but the pretty pictures in the novel are prettier</br>  <br>The worst news for him is if there's drama within Nazarick.</br>  <br>Google is your friend.</br>  <br>Everyone seems extremely loyal to Ainz barring a certain beaked individual, and that one theory about a certain someone.</br>  So how strong is Pandora's actor?  <br>Wasn't he like 90% of whoever he transforms into minus their items?</br>  <br>Yes. He also has access to all of the gear of the old AoG members though. So at his top, he should 90% of Touch Me / the one World Magic member.</br>  <br>Potentially one of the strongest due to his versatility. Even at 80% he still gets the rigged option of copying Rubedo, Touch Me, and Ulbert all of whom are far above decked out Ainz.<br><br>Then again we have no idea on the limits of his transformation aside from the scale of power copied, nor it's mana costs for each use. He is however, one of the smart ones along with Demiurge and Albedo, so chances are he can make use of his abilities very well.</br></br></br>  Such a magnificent beast.  <br>I thought Ainz was pretty on par with the top in terms of combat ability in the guild. Especially sense he spent a fortune on the cash shop. Not to mention his special magic is just OP vs anything with a pulse.</br>  <br>Not really. Touch Me could definitely trump him, and he even mentions on of his other guild members easily beat him when it came to destruction type magic. He might have an edge with tactics, but he's specced for RPing purposes.</br>  <br>He never goes into too much detail on comparison on how to he compares to the average guild member; but he mentions he's on middle of the upper tier compared to the general player base since his shitty spec drags him down.</br>  <br>No, Ainz was considered upper-middle as far as the playerbase rankings were concerned, not his guild. And that was because Ainz was in a guild that allowed him to deck himself out in full divine whereas normal players would only have 1-2, which is around the same area if not worse than his guardians depending on which one. For example, Shalltear has 1 divine, however she also later gets 1 WC so she still outgears the average end game player.<br><br>Ainz build was so shit pretty much no one ever tried it, that's why his secret class stayed a secret in the first place, since it requires you to become a piece of shit just to obtain and it's trump card isn't even all that good if the enemy is prepared.</br></br></br>  anyone have the link to the google docs of the translated volumes?  <br>use google</br>  <br>it only goes up to volume 4</br>  <br>We don't really know the average of the guild, however Touch Me and Ulbert are among the 18 best players in the world. It's not even comparable to Ainz.<br><br>Amusingly enough, those two obtained their titles by becoming as good as the top 18 in the world yet because they won they gained special classes and equipment which only they could use so the gap only increased. Unless Ainz has a done of WC items all for himself that actually synergizes with his build he has no hope of being at the top.<br><br>Well, there's always the idea of decking himself with WC items, but if we're talking about Yggdrasil days the WC items belonged to the guild, not to Ainz.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well yeah. That's all that's TLd right now.</br>  <br>Yeah, I remembered him mentioning his build was pretty much RP based and the only saving grace he got from it was the death sphere. I thought with his worldclass items it made up for it though. Kind of a moot point though, I guess when he can switch to a warrior with all of the treasury at his disposal if he wanted to. Looking at it at from this perspective though you really understand why he's fucking terrified of any of the guardians turning on him. He makes it seem like he could easily handle the one that did if it wasn't for his pride/panic mode is why I guess my opinion of him was skewed.</br>  Summary<br>vol.9<br>fking<br>when?</br></br></br>  <br>why<br>does<br>it<br>matter?<br><br>That's 5 volumes away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the best thing he got was the "All life seeks death" skill from eclipse class dipping that let him ignore death spell immunity for 12 seconds.</br>  <br>The best thing he got seems to be his trump card he used in the rogue guardian battle. If you don't prepare for it (Which he makes seems to ve extremely difficult to even do) it 's an insta win. Even if you are prepared it still fucks you over. The only downside being it's limited usage... Well, that and it's not ally friendly.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Here's a quick summary  Ainz pwns shit </br>  <br>I'd give more credit to Ainz if it wasn't flat out stated that Rubedo makes Shalltear look weak.</br>  <br>Self rez item isn't rare at all. Ainz's version which IS rare can do it 3x in a fucking row without losing exp. Shalltear's can only do it once and it's been pointed out the self rez item isn't Divine Class, which is the best grade she has during the fight.<br><br>Anyone who's PvPing for real is gonna have a self rez. Well, not in the NW but that's cause NW is scrub land.</br></br></br>  <br>Touch Me and Ulbert "were" among the best 18 players in the world. If I recall, some time passed between the guild's peak and the end of the game. <br><br>There could have been new classes, races and players that superseded World Champion, if not more. We the readers are uncertain, but there can be the presence of others that would validate Ainz's paranoia, depending on how late into the game's lifespan was the guild's decline.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought he mentioned self resurrection items weren't common. Like it mentions hers was special too.. I might just be confusing it for ainz going on about his own. It has been awhile since I read it. <br><br>Wonder if we'll ever see someone actually designed for combat appear. If ainz is already an overgod in the new world what would they be?</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't matter, because the World Tournaments were apparently only held once, one for each class for each world. So 18 in total. It's a really dumb idea, but that's how it was. <br><br>While Ainz's paranoia is still valid imo, he's actually only in a real threat because of his goals. If he just wanted to stay alive, it's not a problem. It's a problem because he wants to stay alive with his npcs and be the Ainz Ooal Gown that his servants have embellished in their heads and the long term game plan is almost completely unknown territory.<br><br>I mean, he's a fucking human. Humans have a hard enough time planning their retirement. He's gotta worry for the rest of eternity in theory.<br><br>The only 'relief' he can take heart in (if he knew this knowledge which I don't think he does) is he's probably the last set of tranfers, since the game server's shut down so no one can come out of nowhere in the next 100 years or so and come out with even better shit and slaughter him like he is to everyone now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They weren't common. They were just more common than Divine class items. Remember, even a single Divine class item takes ridiculous amounts of grinding. In comparison to WoW and other MMOs where the average end game player who sticks around for more than 2 years raiding/pvp and would be decked out in most of the top end loot, in Yggdrasil those same players would have 1-2 divines throughout their 10 year career.</br>  <br>"cough"lich"cough"</br>  <br>touch me was THE top m8. 1vs1 him faggot, you won't<br>To that end, their guild was broken as hell man</br></br>  <br>On a scale of 1 to Elfen Lied, how edgy will this be?</br>  <br>Not him but there were 8 others besides him at the top buddy. One champion for each world. And the world champion only encompasses the warrior classes, not magic caster.</br>  <br><br>Who is Ulbert?</br></br>  <br>I don't know about edgy. It's a walk in the park for Ainz and his loveable family, the only things angsting are the small "furry animals" running around.</br>  <br>As far as papa bones knows, not very. What they keep from him is pretty disturbing though. Poor bipedal sheep.</br>  <br>It's edgy, but it does a good job of reasoning it. The denizens simply live in a dog eat dog world. The protagonist and his posse are mentally affected by their game settings.<br><br>Imagine some roleplayer in D&amp;D got transported into another world, and turned into his paper recorded character, right down to having the tendencies and good/evil alignment that was set up by him even if it goes against what he personally is like in the real world. But he also knows this, so there's conflict.<br><br>Well, his posse doesn't know it, because they are npcs and think it's natural.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The magic equivalent of Touch Me in the guild.</br>  So what's the radio show about?  Anyone know where exactly the drama cd fits in? seems like after 3 but before 4  <br>You mean the CD drama? If the anime doesn't cover it you'll wanna get it since it's side stories.</br>  <br> not getting the 1vs1 me joke </br>  <br>You are correct.</br>  <br>1v1 is srs bidness, you never went outside ironforge or org?</br>  I read what overlord is suppose to be about but why are people saying it's edgy?  <br>People die in very gruesome ways while others take delight in it. Happens a lot. The entire setting is a cesspool of crazies essentially.</br>  <br>Normal players at 100 hardly had 1 or 0 Divine items, only top guilds go above 1 for everyone.</br>  <br>I can deal with it. I guess the fact that it has a lich in it that interests me. should I read the manga or the LN?</br>  <br>And creator of Demiurge, also suffered from severe chuuni.</br>  <br>LN</br>  <br>If you want to know if it's for you and are in a hurry, check the first manga volume and then read the LN. Or just straight go into the LN.</br>  <br>Normal players weren't rankers, which is the context of my post, not casuals.</br>  <br>So far the only players to make it to the New World have been total scrubs that left behind Relic/Leagcy tier shit, your point? Majority chance.</br>  <br>His potential is far greater in this world than in the game. If he was truly pushed into a corner he would use the Guild Staff. In volume 4 it was said that he is still against using it because it represents his friends struggles. Also Ainz is capable of massacre on a much larger scale than in game to store Exp from the gauntlets. Given time he could summon a permanent Wiseman and Thanatos summon with no impact to his Exp.</br>  <br>The radio show was just VA's being host and answering submitted questions from the fans, iirc.</br>  <br>I assume they aren't keeping record of it?</br>  <br>I wasn't comparing Ainz to the NW. I was comparing Ainz in Yggdrasil to show why he's not top tier there, which is the context of his own opinion.<br><br>Of course he's a god in the NW. The only things that can hurt him now are Dragon Lords going kamikaze, Brain if he trains hard and gets super lucky or Certain Death if she gets lucky. Everyone else may as well roll over.<br><br>And I'm talking just hurting him, not endangering him. Ainz's biggest danger is Albedo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No idea if it has even aired or how many episodes there are. No idea if the website will also host the recordings for those that miss listening them.</br>  <br>Ah well true but that's given already by his own admission that he went with RP build, no matter how big guild backing or p2w item skills he has, he would never be on the same starting line like those that have very specialized builds.<br><br>Unless of course he has the element of surprise, adversary builds are not good against his and he doesn't run into hard-counter builds like that of Shalltear's.<br><br>And on a sidenote, the biggest weakness of their guild might as well had been their own timezone and work. Why not go in with specialized team or group on hours that will most likely have the majority of the guild online? Hazards of being stuck in single country/single region entity where timezones matter (like Eve-O)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he would use the Guild Staff <br>The reason he's scared of using the Guild Staff is because of the old game mechanics. If the Guild Staff is taken/destroyed, the entire Guild is automatically disbanded and they lose their Guild Base. He'd honestly be more likely to bring out every single World Class Item and every single Guardian than to actually risk the Guild Staff in a dangerous fight unless he gets confirmation that that particular game mechanic is no longer working.<br><br><br> capable of massacre on a much larger scale than in game to store Exp from the gauntlets <br>Any other transported player could do the same.<br><br> permanent Wiseman and Thanatos summon <br>Again, any other transported player with a summoning skill could do the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The logical conclusion is Albedo going crazy enough to destroy the staff herself, so she can have Ainz all by his lonesome.</br>  <br>Is it possible that breaking the staff may also have some negative effect on all of the NPCs?</br>  <br>many of the NPCs service Nazarick<br>No guild staff = no Nazarick<br>No Nazarick = purposeless NPC<br>purposeless NPC = lots of headache, even rebellion</br></br></br></br>  Anri_sama got a LN!Lets aim for anime next.  <br>Alternatively,<br><br>Lose control of Nazarick.<br>Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown no longer works.<br>Treasury is now completely closed off.<br>NPCs become standard enemies and attack on sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  5 hours til airing.  <br>I read the manga and it was good. Speaking about the manga and anime here should be encouraged, but just using these threads to circlejerk about the Novel is disgusting and pretentious. If you want to do that then fuck off to /jp/ or /lit/.</br>  <br>Wait really?<br> tfw still no Reika-sama LN </br></br>  <br>Most likely the NPCs would be cut off ie now status/functions from guild being impossible, POP spawns won't work and management is impossible</br>  <br>http://mypage.syosetu.com/mypageblo<wbr>g/view/userid/556653/blogkey/118627<wbr>5/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> starts a thread on /jp/ <br> gets told to fuck off back to /a/ <br><br> starts a thread on /lit/ <br> gets told to fuck off with this weebshit and go back to /a/ <br><br><br>Heh good luck trying<br><br>I tried</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You can fuck off since I'm not going to read the so far superior source. <br><br>Guess what, for half a year the majority of discussion has been on the LN and somewhat on WN.<br><br>Manga isnt discussed a lot since its pointless out of its release week and only bringing in rushed shit passing as adaptation whose only saving grace is the expressions.<br><br>Anime hopefully manages to be something that warrants discussion. Remains to be seen of it can justify it's existence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you can fuck off, because it's neither an anime nor a manga. Discussing a plot line that will come soon in either the anime or the manga and was shown in the novels is one thing, but circlejerking to the existence of the novel is basically derailed a already shit thread and has nothing to do here on /a/. This is not your board, so don't change what it is or should be about.</br>  <br>Do you know "kono light novel ga sugoi" ?It is published by Takarajimasha, Inc. And that page clearly names it and even says it is about to be published but that she will not delete WN.</br>  <br>It isn't yours, either. Discussing the source material of an anime or manga is always allowed.</br>  <br>Huh, I thought that's the name for yearly LN award or something. It's nice to see that the author won't delete the WN page since I'm still re-reading it for time to time.<br><br>Hopefully she's still going to update the side story too though</br></br></br>  <br> D-dont talk about the source material! <br>How much are you getting paid mate?</br></br>  <br>Yes, as I said in my post. You have no reading comprehension. Discussing the plot is bearable, but using a thread on /a/ as if it was /jp/ and as if this is the board for LNs is cancerous.</br>  <br> I can't read <br>Good for you.</br></br>  <br>This thread was never about the LN until you started forcing your own "rules." Are you just another anime/manga only fag that you can't stand spoilers?</br>  <br>He probably watches GoT and is salty over being called a showfag on /tv/.</br>  <br> forcing your own "rules." <br>How about you read the rules first<br><br> This thread was never about the LN  <br>How about you read it<br><br><br> GoT <br>kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not those two anon but I don't get it. Other than the occasional anon who talked about other LN, all the overlord talk here is basically talking about the plot, just in more depth so that only someone who actually read the novel would get it. You're saying that you can understand if we're talking about the plot that's bound to happen in the manga/anime, which people here seem to exactly do that but with added more details.<br><br>How is that constitute as circle jerking? Does the somewhat peaceful discussion with almost no shitposting triggers you somewhat?<br><br>Also I'm pretty sure that LN with anime/manga adaptation is allowed on /a/. I remember one screenshot from mods that allowed it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did people discuss the LN? Its just the character pages and the official book and people talking about the characters.<br> It seems like you are new here. Source discussion always happens in anime/manga threads. See any type moon thread or index. If you don't like getting spoiled, then don't go in the thread.</br></br>  <br> See any type moon thread or index. <br> Cancer is okay when there is other cancer here already </br></br>  <br>Anime adaptations are the real cancer. The fanbases always turn to shit and it's always worse than the source material.</br>  Any group planing on doing the animu?  <br>Yeah it publishes guidebooks for best manga , ln etc. She won the LN section .</br>  <br>Then report the thread or posts for rule violation. Not that hard.</br>  <br>Not that I know of. Lots of more "wanted" shit go without subs too.</br>  <br>I mean proper subs, funishit ripped by horrible is barely passable.</br>  <br>If only I could rip the subtitle from Funishit video ;-;</br>  <br>You could try using ocr software and such to read it. The ones that are used for ripping bluray .psg subs (bitmap graphics, as in not text) are pretty good at it.<br><br>It asks you for every unrecognized letter but if the font doesnt change, it's pretty fast.</br></br></br>  <br>Looking at Funi's releases for other shows this season, this could turn out even worse than usual.</br>  <br>Wait so there's a program for ripping subtitle from hardsub video?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4dO<wbr>OAEOaUmc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Background music for reading novel/manga</br></br>  Does Sebastian have a profile yet?   shalltear getting off on being a living chair <br>this bitch</br>  <br>Albedo gets so jealous</br>  <br> Human Race <br> has elf ears <br>Still cute though. Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Well if i had to guess I'd say that there's some overlap between her classes as the reason behind it. No point in putting it higher when you can use a prestige class that gives about of those benefits plus something new.</br>  <br>If you read the LN then you can already know what they saying in he anime without the subs.</br>  <br>in fucking wow they hand out charity Legendary items now because of every one bitching. Whats the point of a fucking legendary item if every one has it now? its fucking pointless. has no worth behind them now and it all started with the god dam pandas. who the fuck wants a legendary cape or ring? stick with the fucking weapons.</br>  <br>Pretty sure it shoulf be humanoid.</br>  <br>Also you no longer need to wait 2 years for players to have end game gear. its to fucking easy to acquire. the only way they made the game some what difficult is by upgrading boss hp a bit more and forcing you to lose 5 players, which again is just fucking lazy.</br>  <br><br>Humanoid, dark elf race.</br></br>  <br>It started before pandas though. It was already easy with the lich king.</br>  <br>The only thing I hate about this is that the MC suddenly becomes a prick after getting transported. And just because he turns into a skeleton he suddenly don't care for human life, If only they kept him the same way before he gets transported.</br>  1 hour 40 mins guys.  <br>What use does a lich have for human morals?</br>  <br>To not be a prick. Have some normal human values so that I don't wish for his demise every second he is on screen. It's like he forgets which species he came from.</br>  man this guys art is great  <br>Who you were yesterday does not matter.</br>  <br>Too bad for you, his only care is being paranoid as fuck and the love for his children.<br><br>Rest of the humanity can just die out if they oppose his plans.</br></br></br>  is the novel translation readable now? i dropped it back then because i dont know what the fuck is going on  <br>What does matter is that you remember the thing that made what you are today.</br>  <br>Which is why this is never going to be good. Well it isn't good anyway but you get the point.</br>  <br>The problematic v1c2 where the quality nosedived as far as english goes was pretty hard. <br><br>But yes, it got vastly improved by the first half of 1vs volume. And iirc someone redid the problematic ch2 for the e-reader/pdf versions but those changes arent in the public gdocs or sky's blog.<br><br>Don't have the mega folder link for the revisioned versions on phone but if you got over the first half already, might as well press on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It cant be good because the Mc isnt ally of humanity and mother Teresa <br><br>Well that's your loss.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't have to be an ally of humanity but at least care for human life. Anyway this in general isn't even good. They should have never went with the MMO in the first place. Should have gone straight fantasy.</br>  <br>the way he is now he sees humans as small little animals. he cares about them seeing as he is trying to get the NPCs to have a different view of them, but if they get in his way and mess with his plans he has no worry destroying them to advance his own plan.</br>  <br>He does care, albeit in the excess of let them scurry around like the animals they are. <br><br>No need in acting for nor against them and he even saves few and admires few for small things.<br><br>But it's never enough for you, even if it had been straight summoned to DnD fantasy from real world instead of dropping the game halfway into first chapter/episode.<br><br>So you might as well drop and forget about the whole thing and get out. No need to force yourself to see or appreciate it from different viewpoint.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Post maids</br>  <br>Why the fuck should a lich give a shit about human life? He didn't get to where he is by caring about people not from his guild.</br>    <br><br>Narbel is best.</br></br>  <br>stupid duplicate reply shit</br>   episode in a hour <br> no one gives a fuck <br>I bet the "not hayate no gotoku" 4-koma seyu manga will be more popular, especially after confirmed that overlord will be in badhouse quality</br></br>  <br>slow comfy thread like this are the best though</br>  <br>got a link?</br>  <br>Wait until SAO and Game fag show up and ruin the thread.</br>  <br>Aye, unlike the shitposting centrals for this season. I'll be happy to see new fans reading the series and sliver of hope for Madhouse to deliver some justice and do it right.</br>  <br>Is there even any stream? I don't know which places are still alive anymore, like from 4 or 5 seasons ago that I don't see anything live.</br>  <br>muih jsdf is stronk</br>  I preffer the manga where fat guy is transferred in fantasy world in the middle of battle of humans and demons, brings demons victory and declared their Overlord.<br><br>Cant remember the name of it though, since no one scanlated it for years.<br><br>Or 2nd season of Maoyuu for that matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently, someone didn't read the fucking LN correctly.<br><br>When he got transported, he become the lich physically and mentally. Lich's don't naturally have human morals or emotions, so why would he when he has mentally became a lich?<br><br>Go read a Harem, if you want little bitches and nice guys as MC's</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>didnt it mention how being turn into a lich change his views and give him a mindset of one?</br>  <br>Found it, A-Kun (17) no Sensou</br>        <br>It being a slow thread is good, it means the majority aren't picking it up. Threads won't be subjected to as much shitposting as they would be if they were fast</br>  <br> I preffer the manga where fat guy is transferred in fantasy world in the middle of battle of humans and demons, brings demons victory and declared their Overlord. <br><br>Didn't this end at chapter 20 in Japan because Japan's shit taste?</br></br></br>      <br><br>It depends on what's written in the op, some threads ago a faggot compared it to SAO and LH and half the replies were shitposting.</br></br>      30~ mins left till madhose disappoint us.  <br>I heard it's cheaper.</br>  I've been out of the loop for a few months. Was the last update to the LN really in January? Is the tl kill?  <br>Yeah that was bit foolish, at least the shitposting wass less down before 200 posts or so and pretty decent for remaining half.</br>   based rapeman scans saving the day <br>Even if overlord anime turns out shit at least i have my daily dose of maou rapers.</br>  <br><br>Stream were? I'm not used to livewatch series.</br></br>  <br>I am not expecting anything, so I can't be dissapointed<br>Being dissapointed is your own damn fault for setting expectations too high<br>More so if you know you're going to be dissapointed, which translates to "I know I'm expecting too much, but I'll blame Madhouse instead of myself because I'm a retard"</br></br></br>  Fucking neetball is airing sore ga seiyuu instead, Overlord will be a half an hour later   MC decides to play a skeleton instead of a lesbian succubus <br><br>so much wasted potential</br></br>  <br>No, we just completed 4th volume last weekend and people are already working on 5th, 6th and 7th.<br><br>https://mega.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aCe8c<wbr>5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>His interactions with Albedo would have been interesting to say the least.</br>  Fuck off madhouse fanboys.<br>This anime sounds like another shitty game fantasy one.</br>  <br>I respect your opinion good sir.</br>  <br> Another shitty game fantasy. <br>Here we goes again.</br></br>  3 mins<br><br>get in here fags</br></br>  <br>It's a rip off of re:monster</br>  I blame the shitty synopsis for 90% of the shitposting these threads are going to get. It makes it sound like the game became a world instead of being dragged into a legit fantasy world.  <br>No need to be summon shit. Just let him be a lich from the start. If you're not going to take full advantage of being in a MMO setting you should have never do it. The only MMO related anime that did make use of its MMO setting to the fullest is Log Horizon and didn't have a half way decent studio animating it.</br>  <br>stream where?</br>  I won't expect anything  <br><br>stream link where?</br></br>  <br>Where?</br>  <br>Fucking where? For what I know cc is fucking dead.</br>  http://vaughnlive.tv/princessgogo  <br>Or he can just be a lich from the start. You don't have to justify bullshit if it isn't there.</br>  <br>it is NOT a rip off of that</br>  <br>Where? I stopped watching anime decades ago</br>  IT'S HAPPENING!!  <br>Is there a place where I can watch live jap tv? I swear I've spent days just trying to find something online, but I've had no luck.</br>  <br>this stream is lagging. We have an alternative?</br>  <br>Then his paranoia and lies upon lies to hide his remainder humanity or his and the servants origin wouldnt make sense.</br>  <br><br><br>Would they enjoy an orgy with Albedo + Shalltear and Ainz' skeleton-phallus?</br></br></br>  IT BEGGING  Someone tell streamer to turn off porn torrents.  this fucking lag  The mage shooting ray at skeletons was litterally Inferno Cop sequence  <br>this stream is shite</br>   autotune OP <br>Sasuga badhouse, once again you fail us</br>  its getting better now  QUALITY STREAM  Well at least we know we're going up to the Shaltear fight.  Narberal looks cute, I'm satisfied.   that fucking huge spoiler in the OP   <br>Visuals weren't completely horrible though.</br>  AHAHAHAHAHAHA. Even the OP is shit.  <br>Thanks for the stream, but I'll wait for raws/subs, no need to kill the hype with lag.</br>   dat budget <br>reminds me of Gangsta 20 seconds of paning</br>  <br>It would make little sense if not. Most people fear the commitee cramming 6 volumes into 1 cour.</br>     Shaltear fighting in the OP <br>What the fuck man, at least cover her face or some shit</br>  <br>Animation? What animation? Never heard of it! Even talking heads is out of our budget.</br>  Fucking lag mang.  what the hell is he doing now?  Can't watch from work and wanna know<br><br>Does Cocytus look good in motion<br><br>And does PA show up in the OP</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fighting Papa Bones or just her getup? If former, that's pretty huge spoiler. Cant watch stream at work and phone.</br>  <br>the talking heads aren't actually supposed to be there at the start, Yggdrasil doesn't include facial expression, that's why they use emotes</br>  <br>Both</br>  <br>Nah, she was decked out in her armor fighting him. Huge spoiler. <br><br>Also, THIS FUCKING STREAM!</br></br></br>  There is bad, horrible, and than there is Madhouse.    This fucking Stream <br>FUCK THIS SHIT<br>I'm outta here</br></br>  Did this nigga just put some moe shit over my Overlord?

Oh well. Vastly better stream.</br>  <br>Goodie</br>  Mare, please, stop turning me on  <br> tfw504 </br>  I dont want to sound optimistic, but i belive this can even trump Mahou Sensou as biggest Madhouse masterpiece.  <br>It's not bad so far. At least not to me.</br>  literally Re:monster 2.0  <br>Production values certainly are. The story is better though. MH was abomination as source too.</br>  At least it doesn't appears is skipping a lot of the source material.  <br>literally go fuck yourself 2.0. It's not Re: Monster.</br>  Wait, was that 20 minutes already? That seemed kind of short.  Oh the ED is fucking nice.   It's over <br>That was fast</br>  Albedo best girl   Best girl in ED <br>YES</br>  <br>It's not as bad as people here are making it seem. Until those CGI skeletons show up, I'm maintaining that opinion.</br>  Raw is up.  Don't tell me this is one of those 15 minute shows.  http://vaughnlive.tv/neetball<br><br>To people who missed it neet gonna stream it in 5 mins</br></br>  <br>Agreed</br>  The ED is way fucking better, also dat Albedo  BASED so-bin &gt;.&lt;  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x23tq</wbr>    <br>Overlord came before re:monster though.</br>  Best girl    <br> That skeleton crowd at the beginning. <br>3spookie9me<br>Also, noice song.</br></br></br>  Wasn't bad. I enjoyed Momonga's change of voice. Plus, moe Ainz is best Ainz.  <br>your shit's lagging too mate</br>      <br>webms, we need webms</br>  <br> That armored Albedo <br>NOICE<br> No shield <br>why</br></br></br></br>   OP spoiling events <br>Can this shit die already?</br>  <br>nvm, it's good now</br>    <br>It should have been at the end of the episode at least.</br>  Poor lonely Ainz   00:50   <br>Those laughing skeletons were pretty spooky, need that ending image where Ainz hoists the flag.</br>  <br>It could barely pass as those nonsense nonexistent not happening fights that shonen OPs sometimes have</br>  <br> QUALITY </br>  <br>Then the series wouldn't be as fun.<br><br>The appeal is that he has infighting with himself, because he still has /some/ human parts. As such, he gets paranoid and shit, because he's not sure what to do.<br><br>We've had pure fantasy shit for, what, the past 30 years or so? Go watch/read one of those, instead of bitching here. Overlord is a good case of MMO to fantasy world done right, because he actually has became the character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cocytus and lizardfriends in OP <br>Just teasing?</br></br>  That's a ballin throne  <br> that ice scene with coctyus <br>I'm scared /a/, they won't try to include vol 4 too right?</br></br>  <br>why does one of those maids have an Assault Rifle with two mags, I though this was a fantasy setting?</br>  Does anyone ever get laid in here, novelfags?  <br>Skinned repeating crossbow.</br>  <br>eh, compared to other things it's not that strange.</br>  <br>Shizu's class is a valkyrie, it was added with the Heavens downfall expansion for Yggdrasil.</br>  <br>Yeah, that ending image was pretty cool.</br>  Worst show of the season confirmed.<br><br>Madhouse also confirmed dead. Compare quality of this and Ushio no Tora. Even Gainax, despite being bankrupt and dead never fell so low as to produce such low quality garbage.</br></br>  fuck kind of bullshit mmo game has instant death magic  <br>The old butler is close to. Shalltear shagged her brides in WN but I hear that was removed fron LN. The scene that is, she still keeps the brides.</br>  Raw http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>08995</wbr>  <br>I think DDO does. But usually how death magic works, the opponent has to make a roll. If you hit, it's an insta death, if not, the spell usually does damage or a stun.</br>  <br>Oh, hello there Shitposter-kun. We were waiting for you.</br>  <br>Poor Cocytus, not his fault that his full design is unanimateable.</br>    That Enfrea <br>Holy shit his bang looks so fuckiung hillarious</br>  Goddam Albedo, stop being so damn cute  <br>The butler is the only one. The MC is incapable of it for obvious reasons.</br>  Does Momonga still has a dick?<br><br>That's why he didn't fuck Albedo right there and then?</br></br>  <br>Didn't Demi promise he was going to teach Mare one day? Now there's a doujin. I wonder if they will add the side-scenes.</br>  <br> The MC is incapable of it for obvious reasons. <br>He made the ultimate sacrifice in his search for power. Truly this man knows no bounds.</br></br>  <br>Are you trying to pretend this is not garbage zero budget adaptation by director not giving a fuck about it?</br>  <br>He literally has a boner, think about it.</br>  <br> 00:38 <br>More spoilers.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but the show is fine so far. It's not like I was expecting movie quality. The pacing if fine for an anime, and the quality is just right. CGI skeletons aside.</br>  How was the animation?  <br>What scene did the first ep end on? And if they shoved Uncle Cocytus and lizardbros in OP, yeah 4 volumes in 1 cour it seems.</br>  <br><br>Well both elves twin has seen it on vol 4</br></br>  <br>It's fine.</br>  <br> That's why he didn't fuck Albedo right there and then? <br><br>He's a skelly, skellys don't have sexual thoughts</br></br></br>  <br>I'm almost certain they really didn't understand what they were looking at.</br>  <br>its alright</br>  <br>It ended when the guardians swore their loyalty to Momonga.</br>  <br>Oh you know.</br>  <br><br>The butler with who ?<br>Spoil please</br></br></br>  <br>As expected from Deadhouse. There was barely any. Combined with QUALITY characters, horribly coloring and blurry image.</br>  <br>It's likely one of those teaser things. Otherwise the mirror part of the op should have Zaryusu and Lulu</br>  <br>Who are you trying to lie to? People will DL it and see for themselves.</br>  <br> You're mom. </br>      ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x28eg</wbr>  They should've just gotten fear and loathing in las vegas for the opening  <br>Well, the trick to not being disappointed is not to have any hopes in the first place. That being said, I can work with the anime. Why? Because I have So-bin's art to perk me up right after. You just have to know how to handle your hopes and dreams, anon.</br>  Alright, so after rewatching, the episode does come in at about 24 minutes. So it is a full show.

Even if the interior was dark, it would show up as bright as day once the organ got in. <br><br> In that room, a white lizardman was being pressed down with its tail lifted up.

What's wrong with you guys?<br><br><br>Oh, nvm. Carry on.</br></br></br>  <br>yess</br>  <br>Almost anon, add a bit more at the end to drag it a bit.</br>  Oh man, Funi is going to fuck up this show's colors so bad  Can I dare hope people will drop this by the end of today so we can go back to the comfy threads of old?  <br> LIZARD SEX<br> LIZARD SEX <br>LIZARD SEX<br> LIZARD SEX <br>LIZARD SEX<br> LIZARD SEX </br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>Even more than they are in source?</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>There are multiple worlds in the MMO. Given that one of the maids is a robot then it's reasonable to assume that one of the expansions was either a Shadowrun/Bladerunner or advanced tech world at minimum.</br>  <br>Yeah, I can't wait for shit colors and extreme banding.</br>  <br>Didnt Horrible find a way to reverse the colorspace fuck-up or was that just ruse?</br>  <br>Is it confirmed?</br>  <br><br>and awful translations.</br></br>  <br>this better?</br>  <br>Well damn<br>What happened to her ?</br></br>  <br>Why? It's really not that bad so far. At least not as bad when Gate's first episode aired. At most, I see more people asking about the series and getting interested in the LNs.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>almost anon, take out that scene transition at the end and you'll be gold.</br>  <br>she got beat to shit<br>and he gets pissed<br>than he is ordered to kill her to prove his loyalty <br>about to follow through but is ordered to stop and papa bones heals her</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that. I mean if they will show it in the anime.</br>  <br>She was mistreated by a shitty noble, Sebas walked on her being thrown to a dump in sack. She lives though, though she suffered a bit.</br>  <br>What is resistances? Going by my own experience the instant death magic is going to get resisted the shit out of by any character/mob actually worth using it against with multiple ways to negate it.</br>  <br>Based Papa Bones is based to the bone. <br><br><br>If they get that far, they might just show the back of the mirror and imply it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Papa Bones is a dick sometimes. But he's so moe.</br>  <br>From a wizard to an archmage. A shining example.</br>  <br>DID HE JUST HAVE A BONER?!!</br>  <br>which is why it's a retarded spell school to invest your precious points at</br>  <br>Gate's threads were some of the fastest I've seen in my life. I don't know where it all came from.</br>  <br>probably /ak/ just wanting to jump on the occasion.</br>  So, not only does the story itself is not interesting but the whole production value of this is also terrible. Good thing you guys expected this right?  <br><br>you don't understand Papa Bones faggots<br>his death magic is so powerful even shalltear who has complete resistance to it died to his death magic.</br></br></br>  LIZARD SEX<br> LIZARD SEX <br>LIZARD SEX<br> LIZARD SEX <br>LIZARD SEX<br> LIZARD SEX </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gate threads are gonna be /pol/a/k/<br><br>That's where the numbers came from</br></br></br>  <br> Niggas fucking white tail <br>Dropped</br></br>  <br>Give it up man. Most people liked it.</br>  <br>maybe, but I think Albedo has a harder ladyboner</br>  <br>not even a skeleton is safe from this terror</br>  <br>Obvious thing in a game but he was roleplaying either way. And so far there hasnt been death resistance at all in New World. Scrubs can barely afford/use minor resistance buffs.<br><br>And iirc some of his high tier instant death spells have another function when they were resisted.</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot /int/</br>  <br>Time Stop, Doom, Creeping Doom, Power Word: Kill</br>  <br>You mean you guys liked it. This circlejerk is a terrible way to see how many people like this.</br>  <br>And a waterfall.</br>  <br> not only does the story itself is not interesting <br><br>That's like your opinion man.</br></br></br>  <br>So this is what you do all day?</br>  <br>we don't use that kind of language in this house mister</br>  <br>I thought it was more like Aura knew what was going on since her knowledge from being a beast tamer class felt like it was kicking in.<br><br><br>Generally that would be the case.He minmaxed the shit out of it by accident thanks to being so hardcore at RP so in the MMO at least it probably could double as a good nuke/blast spell. It must have been an utter bitch trying to level all that up though.<br><br>It was over when you said the word time stop.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     3 days after aired <br> still no fucking sub  <br>Why is this happening?</br></br>  <br>Why is Akane so fucking cute? I want to bully her.</br>  <br>Its popularity vote, who would vote a guy?</br>  <br><br>In the anime world even girls vote for girls which is bullshit.</br></br>  <br><br>Other anon here, I agree it sounds fake as fuck, but a fake can still be enjoyable. <br>I personally like her Yunoha no Mori <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uYq<wbr>K8onCOqA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Also https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CJO<wbr>l3SQd-f4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone noticed the artstyle during 08:45 -&gt; 08:47 changed ?<br><br>If episode 1 already have QUALITY moment, I fear this is another twintail.</br></br>  Why do we hate her again?  I don't, she's a qt. <br><br>It's like /a/ always wants to hate someone.</br></br>  <br>Probably something about being a violent bitch and fucking with loli imouto, but I wasn't following the threads.</br>  <br>I also don't get the hate. Anons dislike her because no fun allowed.</br>  <br>Because she's a slut!<br><br>SLLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!</br></br></br>  <br>Because if I like her, she'll get KeyAIDS and die.</br>  <br>Because /a/ irrationally hates characters for stupid reasons.</br>  Probably because she's going to make the MC stop being an asshole and they probably enjoy MC as an asshole.  <br>The little sister was set up for getting the KeyAIDS though, I think others are fine as long as she's alive.</br>  Manipulative bitch   anime name is charlotte <br> none of the characters is named charlotte <br><br>ok</br></br></br>  Has she done something wrong?  <br> Implying Charlotte isn't the childhood friend that became bitter because NotLelouch forgot her </br>  <br>She's very pretty. I wonder if she'd like anal sex.</br>  <br>This is anime. The title relating to the content of the show in any way - or even making any kind of sense - is entirely optional.</br>  <br>A few things, yes. <br>But it was just now confirmed she's shit tier.</br></br>  <br>Ruined Kanye's entire life, although she'll probably blow him to make up for it.</br>  <br>Ruined our edgy MC dreams in less than 10 minutes then stole his imouto right in front of him</br>  <br>I love her voice.</br>  <br>Ghost blowjob?</br>  <br>She ruined the show. Nothing good if she around mc.</br>  BEcause she is a cunt bigger then the MC but she can get away with it because she has a vagina  <br>He ruined it by himself for cheating, or do you think he would have made the test?</br>  <br>I dont hate dead people.</br>  <br> because she has a vagina <br><br>This hasn't been confirmed. If the MC of Ranpo Kitan is a boy then I am not feeling safe until we see some full frontal nudity.</br></br></br>  So how long do you think before the whole government lab rats and the secret facility shows up in the plot?  <br>Edgy mc kinda rekt her when he said if she was going to play that she had to leave. The imouto is a qt3.14 and the white haired invisibility chick, forgot her name is still pretty good</br>  <br> interrupts the moeblob train <br> introduces characters with superpowers <br>This is OK. At least it feels like the KeyAIDS train has been delayed.</br></br></br>  <br> although she'll probably blow him to make up for it. <br>not until inevitable VN is released</br></br>  <br>So much this.</br>  <br>Her breasts.<br> inb4 pads <br>Also this isn't fujoshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she hasn't had any consequences for her actions yet while MC-kun has.<br><br>MC-kun has also not retaliated against her beatdown while earlier he was shown making trucks crash. Seemingly because she's a cute girl that should get away with everything.</br></br></br>  <br> watching fujoshit </br>  <br>Ranpo Kitan MC is canonically master of disguise and crossdressing as young woman. He`ll be able to disguise himself as woman even totally naked.</br>  <br>Or because it looks like a girl<br>Same thing</br></br>  <br>He didnt mention Gangsta, what are you on about?</br>  <br>I don't remember them being that big tbh<br><br><br>To be fair I went in knowing nothing except it was a mystery of some kind<br><br><br>I think we've all tried to master the "look like you have a vagina" technique</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She caused property and financial damage that created more cons in real life than outing MC's secret.<br><br>That flower shop, all those bicycle owners, etc got their property wrecked by that teleporting faggot tailing MC on bitch's orders.</br></br></br>  She's a goody goody, no fun allowed.<br>Basically the Azusa of the series.</br>  <br>And Kanye crashed a truck because he was horny, not because he was trying to capture someone with super powers.</br>  The long haired cunt is better  <br>Azusa was lovely.</br>   mc can't wreck invisibility moralfag <br>what a weak ass faggomaster</br>  She shot down Hachiman  <br> no fun allowed, unless I do it* </br>   female with dominant personality <br> messes with "muh based MC" <br>Do you really have to ask, OP?</br></br>  Because she ruined the chance that the show was just going to be about MC being a cool guy going about his day to day life as a badass  <br> Why is she so perfect? </br>  Because it showed how much of a pussy beta fag the MC really is.<br>He should refuse to go to that new school and posses that bitch girl and then kill her</br>  <br> take hold of Sonic <br> speed kick her into oblivion <br>is that easy</br></br></br>  <br>Could he even use another person's power? <br>Not just "Can he use it while he's in another person's body?", but also, "Would he even know how to activate their powers?"</br></br>  <br>She and Torpedoman destroyed the MC´s perfect school life.<br>Ok, he was a douche, but he was the viewer´s self-insert.</br></br>  But wouldnt it be easier to get a girl to like you to posses her and then have her hold your hand or something and then pretend it was her the one who did it?  <br>Do we?</br>  <br>It really bothers me that it seems as though you're not joking at all.</br>  <br>1. Take over her body<br>2. Strip yourself naked in 5 seconds<br>3. Run away<br><br>There.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would I be? Dont you know how anime girls work?<br>She would get confused and then think she actually must like him if she is doing all these lewd things unconsciously</br></br>  <br> he was the viewer´s self-insert <br>The real reason people hate her, and I hope we all know that self-inserting is only for the lowest kind of faggot.</br></br>  <br> not self-inserting </br>  <br>It really bothers me that it seems as though you're not joking at all.</br>  <br> not killing your ego and becoming one with the whole anime <br>Get on my level, faggot</br></br>  <br>Guilty of excessive smugness.</br>  <br> he enjoys watching women being dominant <br> calls others faggots. </br></br>  I want to insert into Ayumi repeatedly and hear her moan "Yuu onii chan".  <br>There is something off about her.<br>Her conductions were pretty annoying.</br></br>  <br>Because she's a moralfag. She doesn't have the authority/right/whatever to tell MC to fuck off. She's completely unrelated to MC, not part of that school student council.<br><br>She just stopped him because<br> People with powers should behave well, okay? <br><br>Basically a FemShirou<br><br>Disregarding all that, what matters is how many doujins will she get.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm still trying to figure out Pumpkin Scissors and Bleach.</br>  <br>Pumpkin Scissors is explained in the show - if the corruption endemic in the military is the hard skin of a pumpkin, their squad is the scissors used to cut it open.<br><br>As for Bleach, the leading theory is just that Kubo liked the Nirvana album so decided to call his manga that.</br></br></br>  <br>It may be the name of the monster.</br>  <br> Nirvana </br>  I like her.<br><br>I hate the faggot MC.</br></br>  <br> edgelords thinking morality = bad </br>  <br>It is when she ruins my self-insert.</br>  <br>Fuck your self-insert.</br>  <br>No fuck you.</br>  <br>You essentially just got bullied by a girl.</br>  <br>FemShirou is annoying, admit it.<br>And my biggest complain is actually that she is sticking her nose where it doesn't belong because of her morality</br></br>  <br>Faggot.</br>  <br>Are you stupid? How many times must I tell you that it was 100% unrelated to morality and entirely because that was her job? Go ahead, try and prove me wrong.</br>  <br>Merry's VA never got an H-role, so it's not happening.</br>  <br>She's morally obliged to stop him, she's seen how he takes advantage of others and puts people in danger. <br><br> annoying  <br>Edgelord detected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, let me guess, the source of drama will that her powers go out of control and she becomes permanently invisible.</br>  <br> MC falls in love with her <br> She becomes permanently invisible for him and MC will forget about her <br> Imouto   4444 </br></br></br>  <br><br>Wouldn't that not even be that bad? Nao's powers should disappear when she is an adult.</br></br>   Fictional character bullies a bunch of self insert faggots. <br><br>Best girl.</br></br>  <br>You guys said 2D wouldn't be mean to me /a/.</br>    <br>Charlotte is CUTE.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Was beating the MC necessary though? They beat him up for what? Laughs? Because I ain't laughing.</br>  <br> Femdom fetishist get turned on by the thought of women trying to bully men <br><br>Get that strapon out of your ass faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to have sex with her while she's this smug.</br>  because she is the head of an organisation used to stop magic so that little girls can't be magical little girls who go around ruling the world and paying people with hugs  <br>Danger? He didn't kill anyone yet. Unlike flash who destroyed properties.<br> Edgelord <br>Why are you so bitter? Are you a femanon?<br>If so,   tits or GTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>He was being an asshole and attacked first though</br>  <br>Her name isn't Charlotte friend.</br>  <br>But what if it is?</br>  <br>I don't get this.<br>We only got to see MC for 20 minutes and already people think he is all about being an asshole.<br>He's not an asshole, just a guy that as it all figured out.<br>He was setting himself up for the life he wanted.<br>He was just using his power to get the life he wanted.<br>Get the best grades in the top school. That way he would obviously succeed in life "honestly" so he would always have money to support himself and his imouto.<br>Get his, perceived best waifu, by setting it up to seem like a love drama, bitches love love dramas, by saving her life he would have her heart. And even though a lot of girls wanted his D he didn't act like a jerk and tried to lay them off easy.<br>That's it.<br>He would live a pretty chill life without problems and with a beauty for a wife.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally the only reason his harebrained scheme with the truck worked out is because it's anime.<br><br>In reality this would've gone horribly wrong in 5000 different ways.</br></br></br>  <br> yet  <br>He swerved a fucking truck at a girl in order to get her number, that's reckless as fuck. <br><br><br> cheating  <br> starting fights  <br> putting others at risk for personal gain <br>He's an asshole, there's no way around it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She steps on your dick </br>  I hate her because she went full no fun allowed. I would have loved it if the entire series was about him fucking around with his power,maybe going to far in the end and having to deal with that.  <br>and why would we want every MC to be a moralfag? Those are the most boring characters around.</br>  <br>You just confirmed you guys hate her because she ruined muh self-insert</br>  <br>That's not out of the realm of possibility yet. Wouldn't be surprised to see something like that happen. <br><br><br>I didn't say that. Personally I wanna see him fuck up like the other guy I'm quoting said.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, because she ruined a potentially much more interesting story and premise and turned it into some boring, predictable x-men shit.</br>  <br>The premise was all about X-Men, your own fault for going in blind.</br>  <br> cheating <br>The only one that actually knew that was him, and he was only cheating on tests, that doesn't make someone an asshole.<br>Cheating on a lottery or gambling, now thats an asshole. <br> starting fights. <br>That was the only way he could retaliate or risk having to fight the whole lot at the same time, from anyone's point of you he's good looking and gets amazing grades, it wouldn't be far fetched for delinquents to mess with him. <br> putting others at risk for personal gain <br>Look at his face, he's relieved. While it's true he did put the driver and the girl at risk he certainly didn't want it to end badly.<br>He used his ability to get the friend out of harms way, he obviously didn't factor in that the driver wouldn't be able to regain control, he's like 16 and probably never attempt something with such high stakes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't think much of her at first, but after seeing so many anons in this thread being so reasonable, I starting to really like her.<br><br>I hope she kicks that retarded criminal MC's ass harder next episode.</br></br>  I'm confused. Does she work for the government or something?<br>By what authority can she prevent him from traveling about on his own?</br>  <br> Does she work for the government or something? <br>Obviously.</br></br>  <br>And probably she adn the other guy were forced to work in that school too, just like the MC will.</br>  <br>Because she's boring moral shit that doesn't abuse her power. I mean look at the MC.<br>He uses his power for his own gain, hidden his smug asshole behind it, also being arrogant because of it. Don't forget he got good looks, and I bet the whole world that the white girl will falls for me.<br><br>I reminds you he's not gary stu since he's an asshole inside, and cannot be self inserted based on /a/ said, since he's not a beta faggot.<br>And the best of all, he really act like me, even the looks, that alone makes this MC 10/10, and carries the show being AOTYAY.<br><br>Also people who hate her is justified because if you got power, YOU HAVE TO ABUSE IT. Fuck morals, being edgy and angsty teenager is what life is all about. I mean being responsible, and only use the power for emergency, or for good? Heh, I'm not that childish.<br><br>That's what /a/ said though, I just expanding what /a/ means. If you need the source and quote, I'll post the link for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's just like you, right?</br>  <br>Cheating is wrong and he's willingly committing a wrong act. Your fighting thing is fine, I can accept that. <br><br>As far as the car goes:<br>Though no one died, the driver was likely injured, the vehicle was fucked up, and it caused a lot of damage to school property. He knew the risk, and he went for it anyways despite the reward not even being close to worth the potential damages. <br> wouldn't do it again  <br>At that age getting away with something usually means do it again and more frequently. Plus didn't he have a motherfucking evil laugh after he got away with it? He even considers himself to be a villain.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This so much. It's the truck driver fault for not being power user, and had a shitty job like that to lives his family. A bit prank wouldn't hurt.<br><br>It's just a little wicked sinister plan. Best humor ever made. <br><br><br>Read my post.<br><br><br>Exactly. I literally not self inserting. They just understand me so well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hated the teleporting guy<br> breaking all of those storefronts and bikes while chasing someone moving at a regular pace posing zero threat to anybody around him </br>  <br> wouldn't do it again <br>I didn't write that, what the hell are you reading?<br>My point is that MC isn't the asshole everyone seems to be making of him.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>People giving shit at MC but don't even mention Glasses-kun fucking up peoples establishments for no necessary reason.</br></br>  <br>I think a better word for MC would be something like ambitious, or maybe self-centered, which sounds fairly basic but also makes him stand out from the standard Japanese protagonist. <br><br>Until he learns the power of friendship and realises that individualism is evil, just in time to lose his powers and walk out as a soulless salaryman and one of the gears that keeps society running. The imagery isn't exactly subtle.</br></br></br>  <br>looks like someone show her a small dick.<br>honestly she is shit.<br>I feel like we will hate her hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Who's this "we"?</br>  <br>On that topic, how the fuck does his teleporting work? Why would he crash? Is there like a momentum thing? <br><br><br> he's 16 and probably never attempt something with such high stakes <br>I misread that as "would never again attempt something. " He's still an ass though, I don't even know how anyone can deny it. He's not evil, but he absolutely abuses his power and takes advantage of others for personal gain. That's like, textbook asshole in my books. <br><br>FYI I love his character, he's interesting and I hope he stays that way for at least a good while.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> another idiot has been identified. <br>the people of /a/ obviously.</br></br>  <br>But you're clearly not from here.</br>  <br>It's not teleportation. It's instantenous movement. Think Quicksilver from X-Men but shitter and can't control it properly.</br>  <br>fuck off moron<br>I'm most likely an olderfag than you.</br></br>  <br> Is there like a momentum thing?  <br>Basically I suppose</br></br>  <br>*an oldfag for /a/*</br>  <br>Yes, I can see.</br>  <br><br>Ah okay. At first I was thinking he just exploded after teleporting, in which case what the fuck. I'm going to chalk one up to shitty translation.</br></br>  <br> we <br>I'm pretty sure some anons really want to hold hands with her.<br>I just think she's a clever fuck. I hope she continues to burn MC every chance she gets.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyways, no need to derail thread about who is older or whatever.<br>This white haired bitch will be hated with passion. She was shit in the 4koma manga as well.</br></br>  <br>I agree, I like watching the MC fuck around, but I also like Charlotte's smugness when she pushes him around.</br>  <br> Why do we hate her again? <br>Tomori completely ruined that guy's life. And while he was cheating himself up in the world, it wasn't as if he was being particularly malicious with his ability or anything like that.</br></br>  Best girl.  <br> particularly malicious <br>He tried to date a girl under false pretenses and almost got two people seriously hurt.<br>As much as I like him, fucker needed to be pulled in.</br></br></br>  <br>You can see a shadow of him moving as he teleports.</br>  <br>I want to make her eat all the eggs.</br>  I'm glad she made him switch schools, new uniform is much better.  <br>If he can eventually increase the length of his abilities, If he went unchecked there's a good chance he'd start doing much worse over time.<br>In fact, I'd rather see that happen.<br> Highschool boy with powers becomes international criminal and infamous legend. </br></br></br>  <br>How do you know her name's Charlotte?</br>  <br>It's the upcoming twist.</br>  <br> &gt;Highschool boy with powers becomes international criminal and infamous legend. <br>Wow, that's never been done before!</br></br>  <br>Cheating is very much a real life skill. And no matter, I am sure it would come up eventually seeing how he was seemingly serious about her.</br>  <br>I want her to eat all the eggs too. And not meme, with eggs I'm talking about my balls. Not sure if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>I can only think of Code Geass.</br>  <br>The show is called Charlotte and she was on all the promo art. I've been calling her Charlotte since it was announced, there's no going back now.</br>  <br><br>he literally broke out into a maniacal laugh in the first episode, of course he's an asshole</br></br>  <br> we <br>/a/ is not a hivemind. I don't hate her and I'm sure other anons don't as well.</br></br>  <br> seeing how he was seemingly serious about her </br>  <br>Kotori was all over the promo ad for Rewrite and look what happened later.</br>  <br>He was. But he is still petty. It's an amusing contrast.</br>  I got a Diploma because of cheating.<br>The MC speaks my language.</br>  <br>Ruuude.</br>  <br> &gt;I want to make her eat all the eggs. <br>So she confirmed for being Inaho of this show?</br></br>  <br>Code Geass, and it is great anime original. Everyone loved it when it aired.

It gets better later. Not that I dislike the anime art.</br>  <br>Unless they do the principal's face right I refuse to watch it.</br>  <br><br>This shit is already out?</br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br>It's happening.</br></br></br>    So why doesn't Akari just clone three Asahis?  BEST GIRL WHEN  <br>Cause cool kids drink Kirin.</br>  <br>She's into NTR.</br>  <br>They got the reaction faces right, and at the end of the day, that's the best part of jitsu wa.</br>  <br> That shitty voice in the animu <br><br>RUINED</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Hestia?</br>  <br>I imagined alium with a stronger voice.</br>  <br>All of their voices are really light to me. But it was the first episode, so I'll give them time to work themselves into the role.</br>  <br>Well, it's much stronger than how the Seiyuu normally sounds anyway. I don't know how much further she can go.</br>  I was more worried for this than anything else this season. I actually don't mind the art anywhere nearly as much as I thought I would. Also Shiragami is illegally cute. <br><br>I am among the anons that have been participating in jitsu wa threads since forever. I despaired at seeing the concept art with you guys a while back, but I don't think you other guys will mind it much either.<br><br>Expressions are pretty good so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They greatly improved the artstyle since the original picture.</br>  <br>At least it wasn't her El Dorito voice</br>  <br>I kinda feel if she's to...cute. Cute in the moe since. We need more of her goofy expressions, which makes her how cute she really is</br>  <br>Hope to see that in the next episodes</br>  <br>M-maybe it'll be like the Katteni Kaizou adaptation and the art style will evolve every episode, mirroring how the art style in the source material changes.</br>  <br>Yes, this.<br><br>I don't blame them for not having it this episode, because this was before the artstyle change.<br><br>But goofy is what this series needs the most of.</br></br></br></br></br>  Who ED here?  <br>i liked it</br>  <br><br>Speaking of voices, I can't help but imagine Asahi talking about eggs.<br><br> I SAY CRYYYYY </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not bad, not bad at all.</br>  <br> Speaking of voices <br>Remember when the guy was singing the OP and Shirgami was mouthing the words? That was gross.</br></br>  <br><br>I can't look at the lower-right panel without laughing help</br></br>  <br>It was ok, but I would have preferred a female vocalist. Same goes for the OP.</br>  <br>I felt she was somewhat too cute too.<br><br>I think they took her being as cute as she is in the current mango and then moved it back so she would be that cute from the beginning.</br></br></br>  <br>Karen the cutest</br>  Some parts of the current OP animation are pretty dull, hopefully they'll be altered as secrets are uncovered.  <br>It's alright, but it really does not fit.</br>  <br>She's not Marina Inoue.<br><br>Seriously though, that's who I always imagined Alium to sound like.</br></br></br>  <br>OP &gt; ED<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/kgebiuhlrr.mp3<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>   Dumon ;-;   <br>They'll do the doteyes right, at least.</br>  are vampire girls fertile?<br><br>can i cum inside them without any fear?</br></br>  <br>That's what I like about it. More anime need random R&amp;B EDs.</br>  I'm not entirely sure why people rag on this show so much. True, the art isn't as good and it doesn't seem to have the pace of the manga, but I feel like everyone is forgetting that it takes about 5 chapters (until the introductions are done) for it to get the pace and the tone the manga generally has. I willing to wait and see if the anime ever lets itself go crazy.  <br>If her pure-blooded vampire dad was fertile then so is she.</br>  <br>It's not like the manga art didn't suck at first.<br><br>Maybe it will get better or grow on us like the manga did.</br></br></br>  <br>i liked it, it's not the best, but its definitely refreshing, glad they tried something different this time.</br>    <br>Why do the skirts in the anime look so shit compared to the ones in the manga?</br>  <br>Reminder:<br><br>Jitsu threads before <br> mangafags <br> love shit happening <br> dumpire winning  <br> everyone was happy <br><br>Jitsu threads after the announcement and designs<br> Fucking garbage <br> terrible designs not equal to the manga <br> blasphemy! <br><br>Jitsu threads after the first episode<br> animeonlyfags trying to fit <br> people defending the actual adaptation with no arguments <br> Mangafags leaving these threads until this shit ends <br><br>/a/ confirmed for worst board. <br><br>Also the adaptation is terrible, and everyone who likes this is a fucking retarded ANIMEONLYFAG.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The art is technically good, though. Which is the real issue people are having with it, it doesn't match up to the manga's (current) overly stylized look. J.C. Staff did a really good job adapting a similarly stylized style while making it more suited for animation just a couple of seasons ago.</br>  This chapter was fun.<br>I kinda avoided the manga because the art looked terrible tbh but the anime looks good. Does the art improve in the manga? Or is still the same?</br>  <br>Maybe you just need to learn to enjoy things and not be so bitter. I for one love the new anime art style, it's miles above the manga and actually makes dumbpire look and sound cute.</br>  <br>You've posted this like three times today. Fuck off with your copy pasta.</br>  <br>More detail</br>  <br>You're just instigating shit by posting this.</br>  <br>(Not that I necessarily dislike how the anime looks standalone, but it is quite a difference from the manga art. Another example would be Level E; though I feel the anime designs are a significant improvement over the manga art, I'm sure there are people who prefer Togashi's originals.)</br>  <br> Enjoy bad designs <br> Enjoy awful VA <br> Enjoy QUALITY <br> Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br><br>Are you really trying?<br><br><br>Stay mad animeonlyfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Try reading this chapter http://bato.to/read/_/263183/jitsu-<wbr>wa-watashi-wa_v4_ch28_by_underdog-s<wbr>cans</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> implying you're not an animeonlyfag falseflagging to make the mangaonlyfags look bad </br>  <br><br>Please, stop.</br></br>  <br> Enjoy bad designs <br>See my post. I disagree. The new designs look cute actually enjoyable.<br> Enjoy awful VA <br>Again, I disagree. Dumbpire and MC's voice were pretty good and fitted the characters well.<br> Enjoy QUALITY <br>Haven't seen any yet, nor does it matter. After reading the disaster that is HxH for years, I'm used to shit art.<br> Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br> Implying </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br><br>I don't get this<br><br>How the fuck can a bad anime ruin a good manga?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was sort of surprised by the girl's VAs. I sort of expected Mikan's and Shiragami's voices to be lower. We'll see if it ends up screwing to much with the work.</br>  <br><br>It is going to be awful when animefags try to start Dumpire v. Alium. Our broship is not meant to falter.<br><br>Besides<br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here you go. Chapter 1 of the manga was pretty awful, at least compared to everything that came after it. And  is absolutely right, chapter 28 is the best chapter to read if you're trying to decide whether or not to pick up the manga.</br>  <br>Anime is generally a way to revitalize a flagging manga. If the anime is good, it boosts sales of the tanks, which tells the magazines the manga is worth a damn. A bad anime can turn off people on the fence about starting a new manga, and can attach a stink to the name (think Kampfer).</br>   alium is being voiced by the same seiyuu as pic related <br>It just seems so weird.</br>  Fat chance in hell but I'm hopingthat the change the artstyle like the manga happens. <br>But already the VA's are dog-shit. And this thing breaks of low budget. The art is generic as it gets. Part of the attraction for the manga is the art. Everyone has this shit-eating stupid look on their face by default.</br>  <br>Man look at this kid trying to fit in with the Mangafags</br>   no chance in hell we'll get the school trip animated and see Dumpire having fun and being uncomfortable in moving water at the same time <br>Uwow~</br>  MC has THE most punchable face I have ever seen in anime.  <br>  Mikan's <br>How much lower do you want it? I don't think the VA could have gone much lower when she got pissed at the boys.</br></br>  <br>Karen chapter soon.</br>  <br>Well Mikan is pic related.</br>  <br>She went low went talking to the boys, but i meant her general talking voice seemed high (i was expecting altos from most of the cast, but most seem sopranos).</br>  <br>Did she even get any lines outside of that scene?</br>  <br>Would you happen to know how soon?</br>  <br>You can find out for yourself on senmanga.</br>  <br>I don't think she did, but her first lines were in a seemingly normal voice, I believe.</br>  Just so we are on the same page, the manga will still have it's own threads devoid of anime faggotry right?<br><br>It's too far and animeonlyfags will get spoiled, and nobody reading the manga would attempt at discussing the anime over there, right?<br><br>Can we agree on this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It will happen all the damn time. Just look how pissed fatefags get when they try to discuss the vn and not the UBW adaptation.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>The manga didn't get good until the girls were somewhat established and all the characters started interacting with each other.</br>  I still have my hopes up for this anime.  <br>Are they trying to save up on ink by drawing really tiny noses? The best thing in this manga is the noses </br>  <br>I thought the best things were the giant crazy eyes and cheeky toothy smiles</br>  This art is terrible. What new studio is doing this shit ?  <br><br>The only thing you have up is your dick anon.</br></br>  Quiet animeonlyfag here. I wanted to ask why that girl has a screw on her head but you people are too scary, I guess I'd better ignore the threads unless something stitch-wrothy happen.<br>And don't worry about that animeonlyfag status, if I enjoy the show enough until the season ends I'll pick the manga up. <br>Now be nice to each other.</br></br>  <br>I imagined something along Rukias voice from Bleach</br>  <br>Just like Youko is a vampire, Aizawa is a frankenstein.</br>  <br>She has a monster secret. You'll find out in a week or two.</br>  Why was the animation of her bobbing up and down here so awkward?<br><br><br>Read the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait never mind being catty about it, they showed her in the cockpit right at the end of the first episode.<br> AIZAWA NAGISA = AYY LMAO </br></br>  <br>Are you saying you came in here and asked a question before finishing the episode?</br>  <br>I cannot get over Alien's design. There is something blatantly wrong with it.</br>  <br>No on both accounts. I'm not the asker, and I'd forgotten about that stinger until I was in the middle of posting something unhelpful.</br>  <br>It's the eyes.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/iwggfofooj.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Jitsu Wa: Speed Force version.</br>  <br><br>Funny, I gave it the same rating. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and while it does have some quality issues(And we were all expecting that), it hit all the right notes and most importantly, kept the Kansai-ben.<br><br>Chapter 85 is going to be a little late because everyone was gone at Anime Expo. As soon as it's proofed and the last page is redrawn I'll typeset it and send it out. Sorry for the delay.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I... I'm OKAY</br></br>  Shiragami seemed a lot bustier in the manga  <br>So, can we just have a show about the these three dudes? Seriously, they're more entertaining than the main characters.</br>  So, will the anime get to the point where Mikan stops being a terrible person?  It was so sweet and moe it gave me diabetese.  <br>Pretty much the only part of this manga that isn't complete trash</br>  <br>Insufficient levels of :&lt;</br>  <br>What other shit shows have you watched in order for this to be the best one, it was a horrible first episode. Just setting it up to be harem shit with romance that goes no where.<br><br>Want to talk about a romance with a good first episode look at Akagami.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Out of the whole cast Mikan and Sakura sound the worst.</br></br>  I liked the episode<br><br>Then I heard it was going to be a harem. Fucking hell Japan stop ruining everything, not everything needs multiple girls on one dick.</br></br>  <br>But only around three girls are actively hunting the MC's dick (until Durriken comes in). All the rest either will take any dick, are related to him, are actually men, or have horns.</br>  <br><br>Wait, was Teekyuu out already?</br></br>  I like that the male lead is very straightforward and makes solid, well-reasoned decisions all the time only to have the female lead be a dense moron. Interesting reversal on the classic formula.  <br>I also like how he kept making good decisions and they kept having even better outcomes, like how he accidentally used the word "friend" and that made her fall in love with him when using "couple" wouldn't've because of her constant insecurity about not having friends specifically.</br>  This is just like a sign of things to come for OPM. Threads aren't typically that huge for the manga, but the roaring sea of anime only cancer new friends is going to be horrific.  Holy shit. It's like they just made everything as moe as possible.<br><br>Also when the fuck are we ever going to catch up in terms of translations?</br></br>  <br><br>Never. Like I have said before, we're not going to catch up. Tank raws are much easier to work with than magazine raws. If we run out of tank chapters(Which we won't if we keep a chapter a week), we will stop scanlation until the next one comes out. We will never catch up.</br></br>   all these fucking series I was supposed to watch this season <br> nope, they're all shit <br><br>Gakkou Gurashi damn better deliver so I can watch something.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a week tomorrow. Will I see a new chapter?</br>  <br/>  <br>Welp. I couldn't go to Anime Expo and I can't read Jitsu. Might as well kill myself.<br><br>Thanks for the redirect.</br></br></br>  <br>TMS, there aren't new</br>  <br>Don't worry tripfag, everything will be daijobu.</br>  <br> horns <br> sweater <br> necktie <br> loves sweets <br><br>Best girl spotted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  they knocked it out of the park with Shiragami, she's cute as fuck, however I'm not a fan of Alien's VA. Her voice sounds nothing like what I'd pictured beforehand. Sensei and mikan are good too.  <br>The  Old woman[/spolier] is even more kawaii than in the manga </br>  <br>Didn't even watch the anime and i see this green hair shit <br>Im disgusted ruined her</br></br>  <br> /a/ confirmed for worst board <br> go to /v/ <br> literally just Reddit spilled all over <br> people using emoticons and acronyms unironically <br> unironic shitposting constantly <br> 8/10 threads nothing to do with video games, thread talking about pewdiepie and markiplier <br> very obviously an open underage scourge community attached to the board <br><br>And that's without even bringing up /b/ and /x/. It also would be fair game to point out containment boards like LGBT and MLP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> batoto <br>Fuck off MAL vermin.</br></br>   next chapter: Akemifriends and Aizawafriends getting BTFO   <br><br> not liking the best hair color </br></br>  <br>Will she ever be a cool beauty?</br>  <br>I thought Batoto was the best option for manga. Yes, I know there is Madokami but I don't have an account there and I've no intention to go through the hassle of doing it just to read manga.</br>  <br><br>She'll always be one in my heart.</br></br>  Why he can't lie?  I'm really liking this series. For the first time, I like the main heroine, and this first episode was really fun. AOTS-tier for me.  <br>The reason why nowadays threads are shit is you.<br><br> Also the adaptation is terrible, and everyone who likes this is a fucking retarded ANIMEONLYFAG </br></br></br>  <br>Best options are Batoto, downloading from the scanlator's site, or reading a physical copy. That guy was just being a sperg.</br>  <br>Will the anime ruin the manga for me?</br>  <br>But VNs go to /jp/.</br>  <br>He wears his feelings on his shoulder.</br>    <br>Heh, what a sperg</br>  <br>Actually this is one of those few cases where harem isn't complete shit.</br>  i hope animeonlyfag don't ruin our usual peaceful manga thread  <br>He's a nice guy, so it works for him.</br>  <br>i bet 15 bucks you guys get the yahari threatment.</br>  <br><br>And the harem aspect only REALLY came into play in the manga pretty recently, as well, once all the plot-important girls realized they wanted Asahi's dick. For the most part though, it's just a romcom with monster girls.</br></br>  <br>just make sure your OP's are manga pages, and anime only's will mostly stay clear. Although the amount you're complaining about how it might happen is going to attract shitposters pretending to be animeonlyfags.</br>  I want her to grin at my dick  <br>Best options are almost always physical, scanlator site, batoto, in that order. Batoto is fine.</br>  <br><br> physical <br>They're good, but they get worn out if you keep them long enough.<br><br>What about official digital releases? Are they good?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Dumon doesn't want MC's dick though.</br>    <br>She a Robot, her backstory is similar to the movie AI.</br>  <br>By god, you're right.</br>  <br>Her snot green hair isn't as bad as I expected it to be.</br>  <br>come on elevens<br>you guys work best with stuff thats broadcasted right?<br>i wanna see some doujins</br></br></br>  <br>Alium seems like she has some impressive doujinshi potential.</br>  <br> going to cons <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>I feel the exact same way, but you know they're going to fuck it up.</br>  <br>It was like that in the manga, too.<br><br><br>I like the way it handles scanlators better than any other site, especially for manga with multiple scanlators doing the same chapters.</br></br></br></br>  Mikan's investigation on Momo and Rin<br>Momochi (grandpa) + ? || Asahi + ? || Kiryuuin (grandpa) + ?<br>Momochi (dad) + Asahi's daughter || Asahi's daughter + Kiryuuin (dad)<br>Momochi || Rin</br></br></br>  <br>best used goods</br>  Wait, it's already airing?<br><br>I only remember the anime starting production like...4 months ago.</br></br>  <br>You do realize they start production long before they announce the anime, right?</br>  <br>Yes, but still, most of the time when "The anime is in production!" I usually get enough time to actually forget the anime is happening.<br><br>I would've guessed we'd be waiting at least a year, not like 3 months.</br></br></br>  <br>They've probably been working on it since June or May of last year.</br>  <br>agreed<br><br>Its so fucking basic, its not even funny. You can smell the harem from a mile, and they add a fucking vampire theme with some kind of undercover high school girl agent shit. PLUS it has shit budget. 3/10 for having me interested for the first three minutes.</br></br></br>  I wanted to like it. I honestly did since I love the manga.<br><br>but that voice, damn.<br><br>Well. I'll just wait for the manga chapters, hope you guys enjoy it for my sake too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It got better in the second half of the episode.<br><br>Besides, the manga is 80% comedy, 10% romance, and the first few chapters are the worst.</br></br></br>  <br>4chan is a shit website duh</br>  <br> Animeonlyfag </br>  <br>Is that supposed to be an insult?</br>  That TV Version of Minmi-Hologram is so fucking good, always got to have cock tease better renditions of songs that we wont get for months.

Episode 14 in 13 hours!   Kumiko muttered, trying to feign apathy as best as she could. Bathed in the rays of the setting sun, the dark brown loafers she just bought shone dully. The young man before her smiled as if embarrassed, and made a flimsy attempt in changing the topic. By the way you know, there's a really beautiful girl in my class. Upon hearing those words, Kumiko unwittingly gave him a good and hard kick from behind.  <br><br>Cute</br></br>  <br>Who are those again?</br>  Thank you based novelanon for your translations.  <br>as much as Reina wants. So all the life Taki has left.</br>  <br>That should of been in episode 1.</br>  <br>Is he inviting you to fuck him or to be fucked?</br>  <br><br>No, that would scare away the yurifags. They need to bait them until the end.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the laugh.</br>    <br>The novel scene was longer, and made Shuuichi relevant. They really should of stuck to the novel instead of doing all that obnoxious baiting. Otherwise the threads wouldn't have been shit.</br>  <br> Whatever your pleasure. </br>  <br>If only anon.</br>  <br> obnoxious baiting <br><br>Well this is Kyoani so it's to be expected. They should have at least made him apologize, in the anime he's oblivious to his past mistake and insensitive about it. I remember people talking about how he should have just apologized in the early threads.</br></br></br>  Novel spoilers incoming<br> &gt;After successfully taking the band to nationals, but failing at the very end and getting copper, Taki appears downtrodden after witnessing the students crying.<br> Later, when Kumiko says a formal goodbye for the summer she finds Taki alone at his desk, looking over his wife's photograph <br> They chat a bit, mostly about how the students are coping with this loss. They move on to where Taki reminisces how his wife always pushed forward, even in the wake of her illness she never lost her cheerful smile. <br> Taki appears to shake a bit when he mentions that his wife didn't appear weak even during her final hour, she kept smiling for him despite the pain and impending death. <br> He admits that he wanted to cherish her memory by doing something that she loved for the dream she kept. And in the end he let the students down, he let his wife's memory down. <br> Kumiko thinks that this isn't true, and tells him that the band would never have made it so far had he not encouraged them. She says something along the lines of his wife would be proud he had done something so great for her, and that he should continue to cherish her by keeping up the strength she had and not giving up. <br> Taki thanks her before she leaves with Shu <br> Kumiko notes that his smile looked similar to someone lifting a heavy burden. <br> The next morning the news spreads that Taki went an hero and lives happily ever in heaven with his waifu, laughing at all the silly gaijin pigs reading this. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Taki a best husbando.</br></br></br>  <br>Being called ugly didn't bother Kyoani Kumiko, so they didn't bother drawing out an apology.

Seriously their interactions got cut short and altered so many times. KyoAni isn't this bad with baiting, this is even worse than Free, since even that show has more subtext than baiting. Honestly if they didn't have the yuribait this show would of been much better, since the drama was interesting. Now everyone will only remember it for its bait.</br>    <br><br> Being called ugly didn't bother Kyoani Kumiko, <br><br>Yes it did. She's always pissed about him and he never did apologize.<br><br> Kyoani wants people to root for the /u/ route from how they handled that finale. <br><br>I don't think the finale had any yuri in it. They were honestly more like close friends than lovers. People are exaggerating the hair tying and hand holding scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I will marry Kaori!  <br>Why are you doing this to me</br>    <br>Shuichi scenes were reduced or heavily altered.<br> &gt;久美子はそっと秀一の指に触れた。　彼は息を呑み、それから驚いたよう<wbr>にこちらを向いた。　目と目が合う。　重なった指先がおずおずと複雑に絡ま<wbr>りあう。　触れ合った皮膚からは、じんわりと熱が伝わってきた</wbr></wbr> <br>They should have interlocked their fingers at the stomp scene, instead the brofist replaced it, and they chose to have the interlocked fingers scene go to Reina. You should also notice that Kumiko was never depressed after her date, as in the novel. You should also realize that novel Kumiko is virtually a completely different character from Kyoani Kumiko. Kumiko is cynical, a realist, but as her VA puts it, when Kumiko comes in contact with Reina she is meant to act like a middle school girl in love.</br></br></br>  <br> They should have interlocked their fingers at the stomp scene, instead the brofist replaced it, and they chose to have the interlocked fingers scene go to Reina. <br>The context is completely different though.</br></br>  <br>That's totally weird.

The team sat around to discuss what the very last thing they wanted to show the audience, and it was that interlocked hand holding. They gave us the meaning of Shuichi and Kumiko's relationship in the adaptation by doing the action twice; Natuski offering Kumiko the brofist and then Kumiko offering Shuichi the same. Kyoani didn't just replace the moment that was supposed to be romantic, they moved it, showing where they wanted the romantic gesture to go.</br>  BASED  <br><br>My fuckin' nigga.</br></br>   TFW there's ReinaxTaki fanart <br>thank you based gods</br>  <br>But it will never eclipse the number of yurishit fanart out there</br>  <br><br> Kumiko was never depressed after her date, <br><br>Yes but She was bothered by it. Take a look at when Reina asked Kumiko if she was concerned about Shuichi in episode 8. Tell me if Reina just smiled because she knew that Kumiko is single. Or the time when Kumiko lost track of her thoughts when Hazuki talked about her situation with Shuichi in the swings. They didnt completely remove everything. And Reina's VA also mentions that Reina is chuuni and could explain why she's very strangely intimate with Kumiko. I dont think there's not much difference between Anime Kumiko and Novel Kumiko aside from her fixation on Reina which Kyoani obviously turned it up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But it's quality, and that's all that matters.</br>  <br>In the novel Kumiko held hands with both Reina and Shuuichi within two different scenes. Kumiko and Shuuichi held hands before their performance to calm each other down. Reina and Kumiko did it because they won. The thing KyoAni did, was altered the Kumiko and Shuuichi scene into a bro fist and Shuuichi being more confidant or something. Either way they changed the dynamics a lot between these two and toned down practically all of there interactions. Kumiko in general is a different character from her novel counterpart. Anime Kumiko seems to be more developed then Novel Kumiko.</br>  <br> Its in Spanish. </br>  <br>It looks awesome though</br>  <br>I want to believe. I really really do.</br>  This show will always be remembered as shitty yuribait.  <br> Its in Spanish. </br>  <br>do you understand spanish?</br>  <br>Even so there should of been more clues before episode 8, of the two and their relationship. Kumiko's obsession with Reina was so annoying for the first episodes.</br>   Waiting for Shuichi to show up <br> He does, gets encouraged <br> Oh wait, I'm supposed to mad at this wanker <br> Pouts <br><br>Kumiko a cute. Cute I tell you!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I dont think there's not much difference between Anime Kumiko and Novel Kumiko <br>At this point, novelfags have stated that it's pointless to assume that what happens in the novel must happen in the adaptation. The show is loosely based on the novel, taking a key plot point here and there but Kyoani has taken free rein over the character relationships. Shu and Kumiko is not an impossible end in the adaptation, but at how hard Kyoani has been pushing it, promoting it, advertising it - neither is a Kumiko and Reina. Just at this point, Kumiko liking Reina looks more likely.</br></br>  <br> It should be in Nippon.  <br><br>Has pixiv become the new Tumblr.</br></br></br>   Thought it was a yuribait show when it was airing from looking at the threads sometimes  <br> keep in my backlog until it finishes <br> finally watch the first 4 episodes <br>It was painfully obvious reina liked taki and kumi was still butthurt over shu'd immaturity and it was made much clear thanks to the posts here . <br><br>Did kyoani alter too much ? If so is it going to be another tamako love story ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> showing where they wanted the romantic gesture to go. <br><br>This is what yurifags want to believe.</br></br></br>  <br>I see a quite a few pixiv artists post their art on tumblr now.</br>  <br>It could be implied as romantic had the situation been a romantic one, but it wasn't. They were supporting each other, expecting the results and achieving their goal. That hand represented that and there's nothing romantic in it.</br>  <br>I've seen some artist that post their stuff in english, never in spanish though. Regardless, if the art is good there shouldn't be complaints.</br>  Still nice to see yurifags clinging to their delusions for a yuri end in the anime.  <br> What has happened to pixiv.  <br><br>No one is safe from tumblrfags. <br><br>Taki's legs look awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They woudnt even see it as romantic if it werent for the fact they got spoiled about Shoe supposedly interlocking fingers with Kumiko.</br></br>  <br>Man, the drawing is 10/10. I hope to see more from that artist<br> Gotta learn spanish now. </br></br>  <br>They didn't have to show that, even making their arms awkward so that they could interlock their fingers. When you direct something, you want the final scene to have impact.<br><br><br>As the final scene it wasn't that big or impactful.<br>I felt like they were implying this was just the start, not a romantic conclusion, it was more like a subtle hint of what comes next - the real conclusion.</br></br></br></br></br>  Taki-sensei got Shuichi's back.  <br> The legs are still fucking awful.  <br><br>You must be desperate for art huh?</br></br></br>  <br> I felt like they were implying this was just the start <br>of course, Kumiko practically says it.</br></br>  <br>They're desperate for anything at this point. They'd even take Taki x Reina art if it came from tumblrwhales.</br>  <br>You sound way too bitter. Perhaps you're a mad yurifag because there's finally decent Taki x Reina art.</br>  I wonder what type of shenanigans they get up to.  <br><br>Kumiko's attraction for Shuichi has been vague and downplayed. Interlocking fingers now would have been unaturaand forced. Obviously an open - end. Reina still has the hots for Taki and Kumiko still hasnt made a conclusion regarding her feelings towards shoe. You can keep maturbating to your hand holding scene.</br></br>  <br>Thank god het keeps the landwhales away.</br>  <br>Really? Nah I'm a Shuuichi/Kumiko fan. I don't really like Reina to be honest. Also I like good art, not tumblr shit.</br>  <br>That subtle scene in pic related with her eyes brighting up for a split second upon Shuuichi's arrival, plus that scene you described make her cute as fuck.<br><br>It's also hinting that Kumiko feels something for Shuuichi. The subtleties are there, and I'm glad that they are. It's refreshing to see people's interaction without obvious cues (blushing when near the person they like or acting like a piece of shit).</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh wow. All these delicious salty tears.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt Kyoani would throw this important similarity and symbolism away just to pander to yurifags.</br></br>    <br>Why would it be unnatural? They just did it because they were calming each other down in the novel.</br>  <br> not tumblr shit. <br>There's nothing tumblr like in that set. And I guess you won't like it even if it's a masterpiece as long as Reina is in it. So sad.</br></br>  <br><br>I mean it would be unnatural in the anime obviously. Shuichi was never tense in the first place.</br></br>  <br> Pander to yurifags <br> Implying yurifags don't have their own counter symbolism <br>What is "Muh red string of fate" anon?<br>What is "Muh interlocking fingers" anon?<br>KyoAni went across the pandering line quite a while ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just think Kumiko's dedication to Reina is adorable. She's so cynical, yet she's an over the top middle school girl in love when it comes to Reina. She would do anything for her, "I would die for you!" and her usual distant self becomes just a cute girl in love.</br>  <br><br>Those are nothing but yuri bait. They dont hold weight</br></br>  <br>I guess. Still the interlocking scene with both cuties being nervous would of been adorable. Besides it would of also BTFO the yurifags.</br>  <br> Its in Spanish.  <br>Its totally tumblrshit.</br></br>  <br> Your symbolism doesn't matter but mine does. <br>Okay, that totally makes sense. <br>I can't stay mad at you when I see your numbers.</br></br></br>  <br>It's nowhere to be found on tumblr though. And the artist doesn't seem to have one.<br>Anything that isn't japanese or english is tumblr to you?</br></br>  Which one would you fuck? You can only pick one.  <br>The Euphonium.<br>Hibike's are too pure for sex.</br></br>  <br>"Supposedly"? Really? The page is right fucking there.</br>  <br>Frottage.</br>  <br><br>You're probably still in denial about the yuri bait. You dont even need to get spoiled by the novels to know. Episode 10 already tells you that and the fact this is Kyoani.</br></br>  <br><br>I meant the yurifags woudnt make a big deal out it.

It's from the original source.</br></br></br></br>  Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry  Taki.   <br> Still in denial <br>Let's face it. 90% chance canon hetero ending is coming through if we get a second season. But the way it is now their relationship sucks, it's bland and one sided. I'm not in denial, I'm just hoping that we don't wind up with such a crappy end pairing and that the Shuuman gets developed or they go anime original.</br></br>  <br>Can't we agree that the source material (regarding the relationships at least) and the anime are different enough to not be comparable?<br>I'm not sure you can discount multiple super intimate scenes as bait just because "Muh source material's different!!"</br></br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>08434<br>Literally every appearance of Oboe-chan in the anime.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Pretty good, but Noguchi has got the drills, every night.</br>  Which Hibikek would be the leglocking type?  <br>But Shuu doesn't get a lot besides two scenes in the second novel. Its all about the second years and Taki's past.</br>  <br>So far, I woudn't say.</br>  Sorry guys, I tried to get her to do her cactus voice, but they didn't allow us to take video recordings. However, she said "I'm sorry!!" with the saddest look on her face that I actually felt bad for making such a ludicrous request.  <br>But that's not TakixReina</br>  <br>Megumi Fujii</br>  <br>Perfect</br>  <br>That's so cute ;-;</br>  <br>How crowded was it? I didn't even bother going since they were the only two VAs coming.</br>  <br>You know it, mate.</br>  <br><br>Well, I showed up at 8:30 on Friday and was 45th in standby (no chance in hell). Saturday I showed up at 7:30, and the line was somehow longer. I pretty much bought her autograph (Yuki Yuna collector's edition 1) as a last resort.<br><br>The day of, though, I showed up twenty minutes before the session, and there were about ten people ahead of me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of people did you see there?  were there lots of landwhales? </br>  <br><br><br>10/10<br>pls make moar</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if you admit there's nobody as beautiful as Taki</br>  <br><br>It really wasn't too bad. There were two cute girls in front of me cosplaying as Kumiko and Reina (complete with instruments). I'm tempted to go as Shoe1 next year to take pictures with cute UFOs, but going as him without an accompanying Kumiko would probably be awkward as fuck.</br></br>  <br>He's all right in my book.</br>  <br>I need more sugar</br>  <br>I saw cosplay post with a kumiko and a reina and...they weren't great.</br>  <br>He's super sexy, and if I was gay, I would want him to give me musical lessons everyday until we pass out</br>  Was Natsuki ever improved upon?  <br>That's just the reference an anon drew over another anon's drawing.</br>  <br>YES.</br>  <br>It's not discounted just because of source material. It's primarily discounted because of how it was portrayed in the anime. The two girls don't act the least bit romantic outside of those scenes. Reina still confesses she loves Taki-Sensei. Kumiko does not look the least bit jealous about it (which she would even if she didn't take it seriously). Episode 12 and 13, the last two episodes, don't even have a hint of romantic attraction between the two girls - and episode 12 once again strongly hints that Reina is absolutely obsessed with Taki-Sensei, to the point of making her look like a comic relief character. <br><br>Episode 13 has a very strong implication that Kumiko likes Shuichi (toned down from the novels maybe, but still a very strong hint). The hand holding at the end doesn't look even remotely romantic - they're not even looking at each other, and there is absolutely no romantic atmosphere - it's two girls at an emotional time being extremely happy because their hard work paid off and they won at this part of the competition. The only reason why this hand holding is even brought up as romantic is due to meta reasons - fans who really want yuri end wanting to believe this was a sign from Kyoani by giving them the hand holding that was supposed to happen with the canon couple. The argument itself is as desperate as the astrology arguments used before the episode 13 aired.</br></br></br>  I'm going to marry Kumiko!  <br> The argument itself is as desperate as the astrology arguments used before the episode 13 aired. <br>That shit was so funny</br></br>  <br><br>B-But red strings mean that it's fated r-right guys?<br>Seriously though, I will be happy so long as any romantic resolution (if/when it does happen) has enough meaningful buildup for me to believe it.

Kumiko starts practicing hard, so hard that even her nose starts bleeding. She's under a lot of stress and is exhausted. At this point, Kumiko truly starts questioning the world around her. She tells Reina she also wants to become special. She starts bringing her instrument home and playing there. She gets into a shouting match win Shuichi despite the awkward situation between them. And finally, she realizes she loves playing her instrument, that she loves music, that she isn't doing it just because people around her do it.<br><br>Look the final scene of episode 12 - Kumiko is happy and excitedly talking about music to her best friend. Reina is stressed and freaking out because Kumiko talked about Taki. Kumiko wants to be special for herself. Reina wants to be special for Taki.<br><br>Then there's episode 13. Here, Kumiko is no longer Reina's follower. They're equals. Kumiko no longer acts in awe of Reina, or looks up to her for guidance. Reina isn't even the one to comfort Kumiko before they play, while Kumiko is the one who helps out Reina with the ponytail, at her request. Their dynamic changed.<br><br>I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if season 2 Reina stays the same way volume 2 Reina was. It would only show how Kumiko surpassed Reina.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reina BTFO.</br>  <br>If your post is that long, you know that it's riddled with useless shit. If you save that post so that you can paste it later, you know that you have autism.</br>  <br> Currently Shoeitchy hasn't delivered on that. <br>Kumiko and Shuichi literally start dating off-screen at the end of volume (season) 3.<br>They're not going to immediately hook up at the very first episode of season 2.<br>There is plenty of time to develop it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? it's not like Reina would care. Kumiko will keep being her friend, and that's all she cares about in regards to her.</br>  <br>I can't wait for Nozomi to talk to Kumiko at the pool about Mizore and her's backstory. Also Natsuki idolizing someone is gonna be cute.</br>  <br>Actually I just remembered it and looked it up on the archives by searching "surpassed Reina", I never bothered to save it.</br>  <br>Just read it you fucking lesbo</br>  <br>Shuuichi is barely in the second novel save for another daijobu scene in the last chapter. Season 2 is gonna focus on Taki and the second years. If they do a season 3 its going to focus heavily on the Eupho trio and Asuka.</br>  <br>I'm talking about Character development. Kumiko is the better character.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't they just develop it off the bat? As a yurifag I wouldn't have cared if they just stuck with a faithful adaptation, but they didn't. Even with some "bait" I wouldn't have cared if Shu and Kumiko were the promoted romance, but they didn't. They charged past the line of "bait" and went for something that now makes Shu look bad in comparison. Even with another season people would still be thrown off by the sudden push for the couple that wasn't even a prominent aspect of the novel.</br>  <br>Reina's love is the cutest one though.</br>  <br>Reina was also barely a character before the festival.<br>Shuichi wasn't supposed to show up at all in episode 12.<br>I'm sure Kyoani is going to give us both more original scenes with Reina and more original scenes with Shuichi in season 2, even if they have nothing with the plot, just to add more screen time for them. <br>There is no longer a reason to downplay Shuichi like there was in season 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Asuka's love for her father better, especially since she goes through so much just to play his Eupho.</br>  <br> They charged past the line of "bait" <br>But they didn't.<br>The only time it seemed like it would be more than just bait was immediately after episode 8 aired.<br>When episode 9 aired, it was already obvious it's just bait.<br>Then episode 10 clearly cemented it with Taki comment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure why you feel the need to copypasta a random anon's tenuous rambling about what the story meant into every fucking thread. Just because it's long doesn't mean it's well thought-out.</br>  I appreciate novelanon translating the novels, i just hope he doesnt get tired or burned out. I hope we at least reach vol 2  <br>It's fucking amazing you faggot. Try to find a flaw<br>protipc: /u/ fucking can't </br></br>  Natsuki/Yuuko OTP  <br>There's the same reason they've always had - they clearly don't care much for the character.</br>  <br>It's not him dude</br>  <br>But he's not a main character for the second novel. KyoAni needs to focus on Taki and the second years. Mizore and Nozomi's plot is the main one. They can't cut their scenes for Shuuichi. Maybe they'll add small hints between him and Kumiko, but I can't see them make original scenes for him. <br><br>They only made Reina relevant in the anime because she was an important character in the novel, since she was the one that awakened Kumiko's love for music. So her scenes made sense. The only thing I don't get is why KyoAni had to downplay the Shuuichi scenes.</br></br></br>  <br>Cute. Isn't that from the novel artist? I need Mizore/Nozomi art. I need it bad.</br>  <br>The entire thing is trying to read meaning into personal interpretations of individual scenes that was never part of the story's overall theme. It's pure posthoc justification.</br>  <br><br>well whoever it is i want me some Nozomi and Oboe drama.</br></br>  What's your otp, /a/?  <br>Oboe dedicating her solo to Flute.</br>  <br> Maybe they'll add small hints between him and Kumiko, but I can't see them make original scenes for him. <br>That's similar to what I'm thinking of.<br>They might give him a little bit of screen time, a conversation here and there. It's not going to be anything major.<br>It's like what they've done in episodes 11 and 12. Shuichi having troubles playing was completely anime original. And the whole plot point takes like what, 3 minutes in total across those both episodes? They can do stuff like that, no problem.<br><br>The same with Reina. She'll definitely not be as important as she was in season one, but she'll probably get a few more conversations here and there, since that's what people expect.<br><br> The only thing I don't get is why KyoAni had to downplay the Shuuichi scenes. <br>They wanted people to speculate on the yuri and talk about the show more, I guess. If they didn't downplay it, no one would take yuri seriously. But now that it's obvious Reina is into Taki, there is no reason to keep doing that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Azusa x Shuichi.</br></br>  <br><br>this<br/></br></br>  <br>Sorry, meant for this<br/></br>  <br><br><br> The story arc between Kumiko and Reina was Kumiko outgrowing Reina and leaving her behind. <br>In the novel? Reina didn't matter until the festival. In the adaptation, she's in the opening scene, she drives the inner conflict Kumiko has in the first few episodes. Then in episode 8 they finally get to connect with each other.<br> She's fascinated by Reina because Reina is different. <br>In the beginning it's actually Reina who was fascinated by Kumiko. Kumiko didn't want to upset Reina, she wanted her approval (i.e the vote, the panicked crosswalk scene)<br> The two befriend each other, and Kumiko becomes captivated by Reina during the festival. <br>At this point, Kumiko becomes Reina's follower, if not a worshiper.<br>Kumiko had been thinking of Reina since the first episode. On the show she likens following Reina to following the yuki onna, willing to chase something beautiful despite fear or better judgement.<br> The two develop a strong friendship and Reina even admits to Kumiko her innermost secret, that she loves Taki. <br>This isn't a deep dark secret.<br><br>1/2</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it'll mostly be casual, until the scene at Kansai. I don't know I just have a feeling they'll just downplay him again. <br><br>Reina is important in the second novel, but its only when Taki is involved, so her and Kumiko will have their scenes. <br><br>Kumiko though will mostly be around the second years and Asuka. So she'll be way too busy with the upperclassman to think about romance. Not to mention they'll be a lot of Yuribait between the second years, although is it yuribait or subtext concerning Oboe and Flute and Natsuki and Yuuko? I don't know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Reina starts showing cracks, she doubts herself and this time it's up to Kumiko to comfort Reina. <br>This was Kumiko voicing how she felt about Reina in episode 8, a flashback where she sees Reina on the mountain and confesses how Kumiko's va puts it "Chuunibyou, middle school girl big love", that showy all or nothing dramatic love displayed by middle school girls.<br> Kumiko truly starts questioning the world around her. She tells Reina she also wants to become special. She starts bringing her instrument home and playing there. She gets into a shouting match win Shuichi despite the awkward situation between them. And finally, she realizes she loves playing her instrument, that she loves music, that she isn't doing it just because people around her do it. <br>This was just showing Kumiko has a love for music and for the euphonium she didn't think she wanted. As Natsuki put it, "You don't particularly like the things you're good at." Kumiko is good, but when she needs to be really good she realizes how much she wants to reach that point.<br><br>2/3 actually</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kumiko is happy and excitedly talking about music to her best friend. Reina is stressed and freaking out because Kumiko talked about Taki. Kumiko wants to be special for herself. Reina wants to be special for Taki. <br>The last scene was lighthearted, something to smile or laugh at.<br>  Here, Kumiko is no longer Reina's follower. They're equals. Kumiko no longer acts in awe of Reina, or looks up to her for guidance. Reina isn't even the one to comfort Kumiko before they play, while Kumiko is the one who helps out Reina with the ponytail, at her request. Their dynamic changed <br>Kumiko and Reina are very comfortable with each other and seek each other out at every opportunity. The "changing of dynamic" seems like a stretch, Reina put her hair up once before when they were taking turns carrying each other's instruments up the mountain. Instead of just tying her hair herself, Reina goes to Kumiko and relies on her to do it, showing that Reina isn't such a lone wolf anymore. At the final scene we see the throwback to the first episode. Reina originally cried tears of anger in fetal position, and stomped off after talking to Kumiko. In the second contrasting scene, Reina is crying tears of joy when she grabs on to Kumiko instead of grabbing herself, and the wordless exchange is followed by them holding hands and then tightening their grip on each other.<br><br>Instead of Kumiko outgrowing Reina in this weird 2deep4u analysis, it would be more likely Reina was growing out of her chuuni tendencies and Kumiko was growing into a chuuni. <br><br>3/3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The opening scene is from the prologue of the first novel.</br>  <br>But Reina doesn't matter in the novel until the festival. Kyoani's version has her show up in every episode involved with Kumiko in one way or another.</br>  <br>Doujin fucking when?</br>  <br>She does matter in the novel. KyoAni just made it more important. Reina was basically the one that triggered Kumiko since the closing ceremony at their junior high. KyoAni just built up their relationship so that the festival scene wouldn't look out of the blue.</br>  <br> the festival scene wouldn't look out of the blue. <br>It would have looked out of the blue because Reina doesn't matter until the festival.</br></br>  <br>Brilliant.<br>taki/10</br></br>  <br>You just need to keep praising him and I'll give more~  it's quite late though so I'll go to sleep soon </br>  I watched one episode of this then got flashbacks to years of playing alto sax all of primary school and junior high, and now I have a few amazon tabs open.  <br>Thanks m8.<br>I'll think of some more praise.<br>Good night.</br></br></br>  <br>As soon as someone talented gets into them. So never.</br>  wish someone would pick up the mango. i need more hibike material  What's Kumiko thinking of?<br><br><br>Yeah, I mean did the anon actually do further work upon the drawing.</br></br></br>  <br> no i didn't </br>  <br> What's Kumiko thinking of? <br>How many children to have with him and with what position.</br></br>  <br> and with what position. <br>Missionary</br></br>  <br>That's the best. You get lots of pleasure while looking at the face of your lover.<br>Yes. It suits them.</br></br>  <br>Of coursh.</br>  <br>do it.<br>i pulled the trigger on a digital piano after a few years away from playing after watching shigatsu wa kimi no uso.<br>been playing consistently for a full year now and i love it all over again.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Most of these aren't really disagreements, they're just semantic arguments. Wanting approval instead of fascination, Kumiko comforting Reina in a "chuuni" way is still comforting Reina, etc.<br><br> Instead of Kumiko outgrowing Reina in this weird 2deep4u analysis, it would be more likely Reina was growing out of her chuuni tendencies and Kumiko was growing into a chuuni.  <br><br>This is the main gist of the argument:<br><br>Kumiko starts off as a "follower" and by the end is her own person who is willing to stand up for herself. She does what she does because she likes it, not because it's expected of her. She is her own person now. Her relationship with Reina isn't that she desperately wants her approval anymore (pre-ep8), or that she's mesmerized by her (ep8). Instead, at the end of the show, they're friends. Reina is not "above" Kumiko anymore.<br><br>Reina's growth is that she starts depending on another person (Kumiko), but that didn't fundamentally change her personality. Reina is still Reina.<br><br>That's what was meant by Kumiko outgrowing Reina. It's not that they'll stop being friends, or anything like that. It's that Kumiko changed a lot, while Reina didn't. Reina might still change if they make her open up more in the future (apology for smugness being a sign of it).<br><br>Just one thing:<br> This isn't a deep dark secret. <br>It is pretty important for Reina, considering how deeply she believes she loves him. I doubt she would be willing to admit it to anyone else at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I don't think I miss playing a woodwind, I kind of miss the memories of band with friends. I currently play the guitar and am looking to buy a vintage strat, so I don't think I can afford to pick up another expensive instrument. I probably shouldn't have quit band to focus on biology in the first place.</br>  <br>Oh, and I forgot to say, thats pretty cool anon. I love hearing how people starting playing instruments.</br>  <br><br>Kumiko is rather sadistic when it comes to Shoe and obviously he is a beta and a push over. I wont be surprised if Kumiko uses a strap on.</br></br>  Real men play the classical guitar.  <br>I played the classical guitar for a few months before switching to acoustic. It's not fun,it's awkward but helped me learn the fret board. My teacher spent more time filing my nails and kicking my feet into position than actually teaching me. She swore by sheet music and wouldn't let me look at tabs. 2/10 would not recommend, I would rather be a fake man.</br>  Anybody knows spanish?  <br>Some anon wanted me to read it, I did, and was unimpressed with the rambling bullshit. And if you take Reina's crush on Taki as fully realized love unironically then there is no hope for you.</br>  <br>I believe I stated that Reina deeply BELIEVES that she loves him.</br>  Hey, without hesitating anymore<br>I can believe of a future where I’m with you<br>More than any words, because you’re merely by my side<br><br>If I was once more reborn to come seek love<br>I’ll bring to you, a flower with a graceful color<br><br>Even if I’ve seen all the beautiful things in the world gathered before my eyes<br>It doesn’t compare to here where you’re holding my hand<br>Just by you smiling right now I can go on living<br>It doesn’t compare to here where you’re holding my hand<br><br>The place where I found love</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127716577 <br>When I was in band in high school, most people rented instruments like in the anime, so there was no need to spend thousands just to play a big brass instrument like the tuba. People who played smaller instruments like flute and clarinet could buy cheap models for maybe around $150-200, but they were still relatively expensive for any high school student.<br><br>Not many people practiced outside of school either, but I was in the "beginner" concert band and never moved on, so I wouldn't know about the symphonic band or wind ensemble. All the freshmen/first years had to take concert band, so there was a mix of people who just started their instruments of choice or played since elementary/middle school. Of course, the people who took it seriously practiced a lot and took lessons, but a lot of people sounded fucking terrible by themselves because they barely ever practiced. Not even just the newbies sounded bad, but people who played early on in middle school played horribly because they never took their instruments home or took band seriously. We were kind of like what the band was in the anime before Taki came in, but we weren't rebellious about practicing during sectionals and didn't sound nearly as bad as an ensemble. We still did pretty well in the competitions because of the few who played exceptionally well and the amount of effort we put during in-class practices, though. From what I remember, a lot of freshmen, including me, quit after that, but I went to a school where it was normal to take 3-4 APs by your sophomore year.<br><br>Honestly, if you want to be proficient enough at your instrument at the high school level, 30 minutes a day is enough. Surely you had that extra amount of time every day, or maybe even now. Lessons and long practice sessions (2 hours at least) aren't necessary unless you want to be the best in your section. I regret quitting because schoolwork and general lack of enthusiasm boggled me down at the time, but it was for the best.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that was a fucking mouthful.<br>Thanks to anyone who read all of it, I guess.</br></br>   Ui 2.0   <br>They never should have gotten rid of the ponytail.</br>  Which section and why?  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br><br>Crime againsts humanity.</br></br>  <br>Leave</br>  <br>UFOs obviously, 3 of the top 5 girls in the show in one section?

Can't find them on the usual place. I'm sure translatorfriends are doing a fine job but I'm impatient enough to rely on my own nihongoese.  Just ignore this faggot   <br>This</br>  <br>you're wrong tho</br>  <br>Aww shit I love hating on Haruka but that's adorable.</br>  <br>Listen anon I made a huge mistake when I was about 18 and I threw out my entire wardrobe to build it from the ground up based on /fa/'s demands. If hoodies were /fa/ I would've kept them and I'd be a lot happier for it today, but they aren't so into the trash they went.</br>  I like how Kumiko and Shoe1 live in the same building yet they never bump to each other. The anime never mentioned it too.  <br>Look at that smug, confident smirk Reina has knowing she rocks that one-piece.</br>  <br>I went through some of his posts, and the only "pro-yuri" (if it can be called that) is his claim that it's better to look at anime and novels as two different things.<br><br>That's one of the favorite "pro-yuri" side arguments, sure, but that doesn't mean he's going to translate the novels with bias, if he claims het attraction is clear in novels.<br><br>Or did I miss some post of his where he downplayed Reina's attraction to Taki-Sensei?</br></br></br></br></br>  Does anybody have that pic of the entire cast with names? I haven't seen it in a while and I'm wondering if it's been updated with more names.   I know what you did last Summer.   <br>Legit question though</br>  <br> a bug's life.jpg </br>  <br>The reason why it was updated with names was because volume one of BDs came out and we found out names of previously unnamed characters.<br><br>It won't be updated until the next volume of BDs is released, since there's no new info until then.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I honestly was expecting more of her swimwear considering she's a special snowflake.</br></br>  <br><br>Then just read the fucking novel thread in that forum you retard. He's obviously not a bias yurifag.</br></br>  <br>Gotcha, so my backgroundfu still doesn't have a name. I can wait.</br>  <br><br>Mean to quote </br></br>  <br><br>She's trying to impress a geriatric, she probably dresses the way she imagines women of his generation dress.</br></br>  <br>Why would we even need a condom?</br>  <br>Stop posting this meme.</br>    <br><br>There was a minor update last week. The only changes were the addition of R.O.'s initials, and the partial resolution of Forehead Glasses and Jolly Green Giant's names.</br></br>  <br>I'd be interested in seeing that update. Do you know where I could find it?</br>  <br>Forgot my image.</br>  <br>Looks more like a smug, confident smirk knowing that she gets the Kumiko whenever she wants.</br>  <br>Wait, my backgroundfu DOES have a name. Is there a translation for this yet? I probably sound really needy. Nice trips btw.</br>  kekkai shit all over this show lol  <br>Who is she?</br>  <br>Who are the fagotts? This is important.<br><br> Also roll </br></br></br>  <br>Left's name is Kurumi Kitamura, idk about right.</br>  <br>She's 21.</br>  <br>I'd be feeling pretty smug too if I had unlimited access to fluff of that calibre.  That lucky autist. </br>  <br><br>Also if we're rolling, fuck yeah I got my tertiary background-fu, twintails.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Pic related.<br><br><br><br>Right fagott is Oka Mikino</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are literally the best person. Thank you so much.</br>  <br><br>Thanks a lot. Still best girls.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for enlightening the thread Mr. Japanese.</br>  <br>Damn learning all these bg characters' names is making me want to actually read the novels. What do you think is more likely, could I learn Japanese well enough to read the novels before translation-anon finishes Vol. 1, assuming no prior knowledge of hiragana/kanji?</br>  <br> The novel scene was longer, and made Shuuichi relevant. They really should of stuck to the novel instead of doing all that obnoxious baiting. Otherwise the threads wouldn't have been shit. <br><br>And this series would not have sold well</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think the series can carry itself without the yuri pandering, but one's thing for sure is that it wouldn't have wonky inconsistent relationships.</br></br>  That feeling when no Hibike tomorrow. <br><br>Fucking Asuka.</br></br>  <br><br> we will never know what her problem is   in the anime </br></br>  <br>Her problem is lack of season 2.</br>  <br>Most of these background characters are Kyoani's original creations. As for reading,  it's probably faster to wait for translators to finish the books. Reading the characters is one thing but piecing together meaning as you read requires your brain to get comfortable thinking in the language. I'm making my way through the books myself I know this. </br>  <br>I liked how anime portrayed Kumiko and Shuichi's relationship.<br><br>And no, I'm not one of those who believes she sees him as friend only, her feelings for him seem very romantic to me.<br><br>It's just that many of the novel scenes I've seen posted don't really look like they would translate well in the anime format. They would make her look more like a generic tsundere, and that would be a shame, since their current relationship is incredibly cute.<br><br>I don't think there's any "threat" of a yuri end, if Kyoani wanted to make a yuri anime they would have just made an original series or adapted a yuri source material. They're just doing it to mess with the fans. And I love Reina as a character, so I'm glad she got a lot more screen time. I hope they give her a lot more screen time in season two as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well she'll have to get in line for the screen time. Because there are more characters to focus on in season 2. Plus she won't be that important.</br>  <br> They're just doing it to mess with the fans. <br><br>Just like how God hid fossils in the ground to trick scientists?</br></br></br>  <br><br> They would make her look more like a generic tsundere, and that would be a shame, since their current relationship is incredibly cute. <br><br>I was attracted to the ship because it had friction in the first place. But to be fair we haven't read much about their interactions in the novel though the recouncil scene in the anime might be a good indication of their dynamics in the books.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 1280x720 </br>  <br> I don't think there's any "threat" of a yuri end <br><br>They're getting desperate to actually push for a Hazuki-Shoe1 end. It's hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>From what I heard, these novel volumes aren't really that long, so if they made them all straight 1:1 adaptations, they would each fit in like ten episodes max. So it's not like they have to choose whether to include novel content or add anime original stuff, they can do both.<br><br><br>Believe what you will, dude. These threads have had so many TLDRs and essays in them, I doubt anyone still debating this would be willing to change their mind no matter the argument.<br><br><br>Kumiko was my favorite character at first particularly because of her banter with Shuichi, but after finishing the anime and reading all the novel spoilers that were posted, I have to put her at third place, behind Asuka and Reina.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Still best girls indeed.</br>  I normally would have moved on to other titles but for some reason I keep coming back here because of the shipfaggotry. Fuck you Kyoani for being such trolls. I hope H!E threads die already, I want to be free.  <br>You are retarded.</br>  <br>Hey, I'm not the one writing off what actually happened in the show as "it's just there to fool us".</br>     Reina loves Taki <br> Kumiko loves het  <br> degenerates unironically think that a gay couple would actually happen at all </br></br>  <br><br>Maybe if you're a gullible kyoani baby.</br></br>  <br><br><br>time to leave the epik degenerates are here</br></br></br>  <br>Well if they will put anime original scenes it will most likely focus still on the second years. We might get more Yuuko and Natsuki. <br><br>By the end of first volume, both Reina and Kumiko have finished their relationship development. Maybe the anime team can add stuff, but those two and their story are pretty much over, in the second novel the main focus is on Taki and the second years. They'll have a lot more ideas for the second years and Taki with his college buddy if they do a second season. When Reina does get screen time it will be mostly about Taki or just her and Kumiko hanging out. Maybe KyoAni will extend the Kumiko worrying if her a Reina will be friends forever, maybe they'll focus more on scenes with Taki and his College buddy. But all I get from the second novel is that more characters are involved. <br><br>KyoAni love to make their side characters human, all of Kaori and Haruka scenes were anime original, and Yuuko had more focus on her character than Midori and Shuuichi. So I wouldn't put it past KyoAni to stray from the main characters and focus more on the drama between the second years and Asuka.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, time to return to reddit</br>   10 days since series end <br> hetfags still bite every bait ever <br><br>Stop being insecured already, you guys has already won.
