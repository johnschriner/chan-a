[ It's time.  <br><br>Chapter 90 is sort of the end of this whole arc before things get back to normal.

They don't have powers but they have financial backing and training from a "bruce wayne"-esque shady character. <br><br>MC is doing good, stopping villians and heroes alike, things start to return to normal, his family finds a small place to live. It's a humble existence.<br><br>With the heroes gone, crime-lords start taking over where the "villians" left off, leaving dozens of fractures "crime-groups" to fight over what's left of the city. <br><br>MC comes home one day only to find his family tied up with a group of thugs around them.

On average though, she's often depicted as being 10 or 12.<br><br>If you mean ACTUAL age, though,<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>12</br></br>    <br> he thinks she's denying you </br>  <br>Looks 83 to me, officer.</br>  A best sister.<br>A best everything.</br>  All this talk about characters getting resolution had me wondering.<br><br>Does normal get with anyone? Does she finally get the husbando she deserves?</br></br>  All the sisters are goddess tier except for the lawyer.  I think I came to the realization that I hate just about everyone in the Takanashi family  <br>She is just stressed from work and her ex.<br><br>Karino please.</br></br></br>  <br>The mangaka hints at a pairing with Kirio.</br>  This looked 10 times cooler than anything in the second season.  What animu?  Fuckin' a. It's been a while since I've had to rewind to watch something again.  <br>Well yeah, it probably had a big budget for such a tiny short. You can't expect the same visuals from a full season.</br>  I have a theory:<br><br>People who don't like Cat have not read Nekomonogatari (White).<br><br>Or to put it another way, I can't imagine anyone not liking Hanekawa having read it. It had dimensions that got cut out of the adaptation.<br><br>With that out of the way, let the customary waifu wars commence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Jesus, really? Those standards are insane.<br><br>How are you supposed to treat your adoptive parents who never loved you and made you unwelcome in your own home for almost your entire life?<br><br>It's also not fair to blame her for things Kako did.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a vicious cycle, really. They both treated each other without love and everyone felt unwelcome at home.<br>Also Kako IS her.<br>She acknowledges it herself that she was partially to blame for the things that happened. I wouldn't call her awful to her parents though, yeah, just completely loveless.</br></br></br>  <br> It's also not fair to blame her for things Kako did. <br> It's also not fair to blame Hitler for things the Fuhrer did </br></br>  <br><br><br>If I roll over in my sleep and smack you in the head with my arm, am I to blame?<br><br>Also, what the fuck are you doing in my bed anon?<br><br>Are you g-gay or s-something?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to the point of me pointing fingers and judging you for it, but yes.<br>Also this is my bed, so it's even more your fault.</br></br>  And go.  <br>This happens to any fanbase that is prevalent in a community. See Tominofags in /m/'s case. For those fanbases the site's worth is that of a hugbox so they want to keep it like that.</br>   trust me read the VN, path x first    Monogatari is the best anime   <br>Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>I think it's hilarious when people do this, really. Or when people try to tell me Japan doesn't have a military.</br>  Sumo is a pretty major thing in japan right? So why don't we see more anime about them, Characters based on them. Or heck, even comedic references to them?  <br>Because fat fucks aren't moe, or fapbait or pleasant to watch.</br>  Does anyone wanna explain to me how the fuck Guts lifted the Dragonslayer with his teeth? <br><br>  also does anyone have a picture of that panel? </br></br>    <br>Get out.<br><br>Leave.</br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 6 i think</br>  <br> Magical negro blessing. <br>   He is half demon/monster </br></br>  <br><br>You guys know that the movies cover literally like 30% of the golden arc, right?<br>You skipped what's arguably the best arc in manga history. I don't have any comment to make.</br></br></br>  Latest chapter released by shitty translation:<br><br>http://www.readmanga.today/shokugek<wbr>i-no-soma/126<br><br>Festival rankings:<br><br>1.

Souma was only able to evade his trick by knowing about it beforehand.</br>  Benten is the best written character in anime. I'm not even going to challenge you to prove me wrong.  <br>The only thing that still bothers me is the nostrils, they just look so weird with them. Would've been best to just leave them off.</br>  She's captivating, for sure.  <br>Kumeta's designs aren't even in the anime. The character designer for the anime was Kousuke Kawazura, Kumeta just did the original base design.</br>  <br> Benten <br>What was her deal anyway? She's just a huge cunt through the entire series. Was there a reason?</br></br>  <br>Try watching it.</br>  Last thread<br><br><br><br>Keep shitposting to a minimum.<br><br>Will ufotable ever go back to their old artstyle?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   That initiation process <br>So drilling breaclet to your arm are just Rachell preference?<br><br><br>Enjoyable but still lacking</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aw shit nigga no.</br>  <br>one thing leads to another you fucking retard <br><br>it looks horrible</br></br></br>  <br> shitpost alone on anime he hate <br> calls peoples cancer <br>The irony</br></br></br>  <br>How it looking horrible is relevant at all to what I'm talking about?</br>  Reminder.  <br>It turned into a harem out of nowhere. The only person who you could say had feelings for him in S1 was Ayase (before she thought he was a disgusting creep and forcing otaku fetishes onto Kirino), and Kuroneko (who really only had feelings for him toward the end). <br><br>I thought the ending was highly entertaining, because of how much of a trainwreck it was, but other than that I hated it. I feel like it ruined the story. And I don't even care if the LNs were vastly different. I liked S1, I wanted to see more of that. Instead I got a harem that the author had to leave ambiguous due to censorship laws.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope. I'm right with ya friend.<br><br>Daily reminder for all the anime only fags:<br>http://pastebin.com/g1awYmW4</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know. I know that all too well.</br>  <br>Yeah, that was the annoying part.</br>  Reminder she rides her  Nissan  every night</blockquote>]
