[ https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.   No spoiler summary on the OP? Disappointing.      Coma Cheese  I don't get the joke.    Now that's alpha.    "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"    "No, not really... I just thought that you're incredible."    "Haa? Are you making passes at me again?"    Isshiki shoves spoon into 8man's mouth.    "Do you hate that level of sweetness?"    "...I don't."    "Ah, but I wasn't talking about the flavor..."    She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.    "Even so, my answer is the same."    "Is that so..."    Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.    "Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"    8man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.    "Too sweet..."                               Fresh thread! Fuck yeah /a/  Spoilers from volume 11:  Yukino gives 8man the chocolate.   Spoilers from volume 11:   Iroha won't be in volume 12 because Sensei is going to make sure she's not slacking off at the Service Club     Yukino? I thought Yui was the one giving them.  Better for Yukinofags like me     Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                      Spoiler that shit next time, jesus.    Summary of the entire LN:  -Yui being a retarded whore who can't even say her true feelings and now is getting BTFO because she wants to live a lie -Yukino is a worthless bitch who can't fix her own mess and try to ask for help to everyone, first hayama, then Haruno and now 8man. Fucking dependant whore. -8man is an edgy faggot who try to find muh genuine even if he have that on his face but he's too retarded to make a single desition because he's just a coward. -Haruno take the antagonist role just because all those 3 faggots can't even realize they are living a lie. -Hayama a cunt -SENSEI IS THE ONLY TRUE ENDING BUT WATARI IS A CUCKLORD SO HE'S GOING TO PICK YUI OR YUKINO  Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?             Fuck off retard, stop posting false information      I'll make a summary   Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?      Friendly reminder  To those complaining about Spyro's translations having mistakes, many people here are happy enough to have his translations. Spyro is a damn blessed soul for them. An official translation means having to wait years until it reaches the point where we currently stand, and we don't want that. I will read it raw too because japanese isn't a problem to me, but that's not the case for others here so stop being a retarded fucktards and show some appreciation to Based Syro at least. He's doing this for free. Fucking plebs    Meta cuck   Marvelous.    I'm gonna miss you after this all over. See you in another thread in summer, I guess   No matter how much shitposting we make, you're all great, anons. Couldn't ask for a better, fucking twisted community. Fuck you all anons, fuck you all.    Blatant shitposter obviously trying to false-flag one of the smallest and weakest waifu factions.   Nigga go fuck yourse-   Doesn't bother including Iroha   kek'd. Carry on you gigantic faggot.           Implying he's not falseflagging falseflag     So he's not  genuine ?    Wait, would that mean he's actually a senseifag, or that he intended for his post to be called out as a false flag?   Little sister won right?   She already won before Hachiman got turned down by Orimoto    too lewd    I think this comic will answer your question  (1/3)      Hachiman teachings:  “It’s obvious they did that so no one would suspect them. If it were me, I would’ve avoided slandering one of them on purpose to frame them.”  He intended to be called out as an irohafag falseflagging a weak faction. Either a senseifag who wanted pity or an anti-irohafag      (2/3)    (3/3)    The best.     As to be expected     Maybe so, but I figured that given how Irohafags have been clinging to Iroha's spoon thing that taking a jab at her irrelevance by leaving her out would be far more damning than the meaningless words tossed at everyone else.   Making me read at 4 am   It's a commie meme sub. It sounds like she's saying that but the real joke is that she thought he was talking about the rice which CR surprisingly got right.     Reading  What kind of american are you?     I have a hunch that you are a yukinofag trying to falseflag and frame irohafags   In all honesty, 8man's behavior in the spoon-feeding scene is pretty suspect, and it's possible Iroha realized it too. (Thus her ambiguous reaction to the exchange.) Namely, between the "words she was waiting for" and the "Too sweet" line at the end, there are implications that 8man wasn't being entirely genuine with Iroha here during the spoon dialogue.  The question is, what does it mean if he wasn't? 8man outright lying to Iroha would be an extreme step out of his usual character. Even if he's guilty of falling into non-genuine patterns in the past, he usually never does it directly through dialogue, but instead manufacturing situations where it's not necessary to do so. (Such as the whole valentine's event.) Therefore, even if he isn't being honest with her, it becomes an equally (if not moreso) big event specifically because he's not being honest with her.  In previous scenarios where 8man's non-genuine, it's usually been a misguided and fear-driven attempt to maintain (or, in his words, "protect") something he doesn't want to lose. Take the club for instance, which he effectively froze into a status quo because he was afraid the election would cause their friendship to dissolve. When he stopped being non-genuine with the club, it's not like he gave up on the club itself. He got exactly what he wanted and the club became closer and more "genuine".  1/2          Now let's look at this instance, 8man is clearly being forward with Iroha in this case. Normally when she's being sly and flirtatious he'll tsukkomi, brush it off, or generally not give a proper answer. In this case he actually answers in a positive fashion: "I didn't dislike it." 8man isn't cold/dishonest enough to use Iroha's feelings for utility, so if he's being non-genuine in returning her flirtation it's because he's afraid of what not flirting will do with their relationship. 8man's non-genuine actions stay true to what he genuinely wants, but pursue them in the wrong manner.  For these reasons, even if he's not being genuine in his dialogue with Iroha, it still seems to demonstrate a desire to build a romantic relationship on his part. Furthermore it's not likely that it's "I have to humor her to preserve our friendship", as 8man has been aware of Yui's feelings for quite a while but has not given her the same sort of treatment. It goes without saying that something as cliche as "this isn't genuine, I actually love X" is unlikely, as his prior development shows that a non-genuine attempt to be with Iroha will be backed by a genuine desire to do so.   In conclusion I'd say that Iroha has very likely won 8man's affection, but she has not yet won the 8bowl. The simple reason being that since Watari put in those implications, it's most likely so he can capitalize on them for later drama. As an Irohafag I'm actually pleased about this because, quite frankly, it wouldn't be good writing if things were so simple. Iroha's best and most endearing moment is when she was on the train after being rejected, and she really hasn't been given any particularly emotional scenes other than that. There's upcoming roadbumps but, assuming 8man doesn't catastrophically fuck things up, their relationship will be all the better for it in the end.  2/2           You should stop if you don't even know what those 3 pages were about.    Can't fall asleep so it might help but it was like only 4 minutes long    It's not that Commie didn't got it wrong, it's that it makes sense. I don't know how CR translated it but if they went "Komachi? Who's that, rice?" they went full retard.    We should wait until some anon gives us a proper translation of all six pages, and not just a summary. For instance, I don't know if he said "too sweet" or just "sweet" (amai)     This is kind of a stretch, and that coming from a guy who was happy to see 8man shift from "this was irresponsible of me" to "how do I even ask someone out" with Yui's promise date.     Are you seriously believe that everybody in your fanbase is completely innocent and can do no wrong? And is it somehow always Yukinofags fault?    It's become a bit of a meme to blame literally everything on Yukinofags evwn though literally the only ones waifufagging are Irohafags.    mu dik   Also, despite that I also enjoyed keep talking about saliva and flirting as if they really exists. But in fact this part only has one meaning: It's hinted that Iroha will make a move in the valentine day (or later) using the "preference" she got from 8man in this scene.   He says 甘すぎだな     Does he know? Do you think he still think that Iroha is going after Hayama? He can't be that dense right? A girl waited for him until he show up just to ask him about his choco preference.      Correct me if i am wrong.  From what happen in ,When Yui is saying she want everyone living in lie together with her. She trying to baiting 8man or Yukino to called out her bullshit.  8man bit it and desperate do another genuine speech to convince both Yui and Yukino back on track to find genuine thing together with him instead stray to superficiality.  After 8man speech done, when Yui saying it just like him and smiling.  8man realises Yui intention and that he (and possibly Yukino too) was the one that almost stray to superficiality makes him cry.         He states 甘いすぎだな when she walks away, when licking the chocolate from his cheek.  甘いすぎ literally translates to "too sweet".  That line alone is a pretty big warning flag, especially the way it's used. The "words she was waiting for" is more of an additional nail in the coffin.  And really, it comes down to simple narrative structure. There's no way in Iroha and 8man would get into a relationship without it running into some kind of drama before the end of the series, it wouldn't be refined if it isn't put to the test at any point.          I don't believe irohafags are completely innocent and free of shitposters. However, in this case, it's very unlikely for them to be behind that post. Why would we be so obvious at false-flagging, when we can just circlejerk about the (not confirmed yet) indirect kiss and their flirting afterwards?  Once you discarded irohafags, then the culprit has to be either yukinofag or yuifag. And there are 3 reasons why a yukinofag is most likely behing that post:  He shitted on Yui before Yukino (while the normal order would be Yukino and Yui). He did the same with who will win (Yui first, then Yukino)   Between yukinofags and yuifags, the first ones tend to be more anti-irohafags than the latter (I call it not-first-girl sympathy)   Sensei is like an adult Yukino (although this argument is subjective)           いすぎ     Yes, that was why some anon said she is the hero Service Club deserve.    Feel free to elaborate.  I did maybe go a bit too strongly by taking it for granted that 8man already likes Iroha, but at the very least things are heading in that direction.  The 嫌いじゃねえけど was a very significant statement by 8man. What is currently in question is the exact motivations behind him saying it.       Iroha will win, right?   Now you're projecting  Who's to say it's not Totsukafag or even Hayacuckfag?  Really, no one is fucking innocent. Best bet is to assume all falseflaggers are neutral party who wanted to see the thread burn  Which is what happened with almost every thread anyway.         「えいっ！」 一色の声と一緒に、頬をかすめてスプーンが口に突っ込まれる。突然の出来事<wbr>にもごっとまごつき、目を白黒させていると、その明滅する視界の中で、一色<wbr>が蠱惑的に笑った。 「先輩、こういう甘いの、お嫌いですか？」 スプーンをふりふりしながら、小首を傾げ、一色は上目遣いにこちらを見る。<wbr>いたずらに成功した子供のように得意げな口元の微笑みと、女の子らしく挑発<wbr>的に胸を張る姿はアンバランスで、だからこそひどく魅力的に映る。 「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」 糖分はきっとそこまでではないのだろうけれど、舌が痺れるほどに甘い。てい<wbr>うか、そのスプーンさっき使ってやつじゃないの……、そういうことされると<wbr>ほんと心臓に悪いからやめてほしい……。 疲労には甘いものがいいと言うが、この手の心労には逆効果らしい。どっと押<wbr>し寄せてくる疲れに思わず吐息を漏らすと、一色も同じようにため息を吐いた<wbr>。 「はぁ。別に味の感想聞いたわけじゃないんですけど」 口ぶりこそ興味がなさそうだったが、ちらと向けられた瞳には答えを待ってる<wbr>色がある。 俺は口の中に残る甘さを噛み締めながら、一色の言わんとするところを噛み砕<wbr>いた。</wbr> </wbr>  </wbr></wbr> </wbr></wbr>  </wbr></wbr>  </wbr></wbr>     3 reasons why a yukinofag is most likely behing that post:  All your reasons are bullshit      the words she was waiting for  He fucking knows, anon. He's not buying into the Hayama crap anymore.     She is there for the drama so not likely. She might be another Kuroneko    He picked up enough to give her a forward answer regarding the chocolate. Whether he has a solid idea of how she feels about Hayama I don't know, but whatever he thinks about it he's shown intent in getting closer to Iroha.   My mistake, it's pretty late.      「それでも、答えは変わらんな…」 「…そうですか」 一色は何事か考えるように、腕の中のボウルを見つめてふむふむと頷く。そし<wbr>てぱっと顔を上げた。 「参考になりました。じゃ、ちょっと行ってきますね。葉山せんぱーい！」 にこやかな微笑みで言うが早いか、一色はばたばたと駆け出していく。 それを見送りながら、ほっぺについたチョコを指で拭って口に運んだ。チョコ<wbr>レートとラム酒の香りが鼻を抜けていく。 「甘すぎだな……」 </wbr>   </wbr>     I'll be expecting your full thesis on how Yukinofags did everything wrong by friday. Don't let me down anon   Why is she using to pencils as chopsticks?   I can't figure out whether this is satire or just the ramblings of a retard    Guaranteed replies/10.     “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   MUH FUCKING DICK         W-where is the evidence?       Actually yeah, when you put it that way it's almost undeniable that 8man realizes what he's doing.  He's answering a girl who seemingly likes him by giving her "the words she was waiting for". It sounds like he's going after Iroha but with an eroge-esque mindset of acting with the express purpose of making the girl like you more.  In short, 8man's lack of relationship experience is going to fuck him over.         She is there for the drama  kek, she is there for comic relief       This is fucking delicious, 8man trying to go romantic on Iroha. Thank you Watari, you\re not that much of a cunt now.       Iroha finally wins   might actually just be getting Kuroneko'd   Kill me.      There is not going to be another Kuroneko for at least another decade. Everybody remembers what happened when she got kuroneko'd.     Yeah that's the only really glaring issue. You were building a solid argument, then completely jumped the shark by speculating that 8man might want to actively pursue romance with her.  I am interested in the 嫌いじゃねえけど debate though. I'm passingly familiar with the phrase, but I don't really into moon so I'm probably missing out on some nuance.  The best translation would be "I don't hate it but-" correct?          drama  It is out of her character to be all drama queen like. Even at her lowest when she was shown to be out of her depth during the stuco collab event and at the end of the disneyland, she never made a big deal out of it or cause huge drama.      I'm a Yuifag, but somehow I feel like Irohafags circle jerk is a lot more endurable than Yukinofags circle jerk.    It's nice now that its calmed down. It was goddamned unbearable right after the pages with the tasting scene got posted. Some of those guys turned the autism dial to 13 then broke the knob off.    We don't photoshop saliva or an actual kiss between the two and then shitpost those until the website's duplicate image system prevention kicks in.     The best translation would be "I don't hate it but-" correct?   「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」   But the pause is before the sentence, so it should be But I don't hate it. Another story would be that the pause was at the end, as if he didn't finish the sentence       Stop false flagging!     Just to add something to this, isn't Iroha the only one he went out of his way to talk to during the chocolate-making? Orimoto comes to him, Yukino calls him for chocolate-tasting, and Hayama just happens to be there while he's chilling by the wall. Iroha he actually walks up to and compliments for being able to make sweets, it's almost no surprise that she immediately responds with the hitting-on gag. And then of course we get the sweetness conversation from that.     Basically he thought for a long time before saying this line. His brain was shutting down.    She was made to lose.    The dots / pause came before the sentence. My guess would be "but I don't dislike/hate it". A comma or a repositioning of that pause would change everything.      You must be not here when the fake spoilers were posted for the first tiem.    How can one girl be so fucking best?     "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"  now BTFO yui       How the fuck can you be mad about phoroshop? That's the only good thing to come out of these threads. Not to mention that scene was basically asking to be shopped.    Who the fuck is trying to raise false flags? Fucktards. Yuifags are at least easier to tolerate than Irohafags.   I'm not especially proficient myself but I'm pretty sure it's meaning changes contextually. What you're referring to would be more like 嫌いじゃねえ、けど。。。 which would firmly indicate the けど leads off into something else. When it's just used to end a standard sentence I think it turns into more of a slang/nuance that indicates a non-committal answer.  That said I'm really not an authority. I've heard けど end sentences a lot though and I don't recall it ever being something that significant. It really doesn't make sense contextually for 8man to be using lead-offs in that conversation either.     Holy shit this thread going mad again. Sasuga /a/, I'm going outta here.  Fuck the falseflagger, all of you.      Hayate  Hinagiku end when?     Wait, when did the spoon come off his mouth? The illustration shows this part  She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes.  And he still has the spoon on his mouth.      So basically Yui is Haruno's foil in this volume.    She intervenes when Haruno's needling are making things uncomfortable between Yukino and Hachiman during cooking event, even though it pains her.    When Haruno says she's moving in with Yukino, causing Yukino to despair, Yui invites her to stay with her.    At the end, Yui is the catalyst for the dialogue that leads to the service club finally starting to overcome the problems Haruno exposed.        thinking about what others said about the pause being in front, is it possible that he only vocalized the back half of a thought? like say "It's too sweet, but I don't hate it"     「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."   「甘すぎだな……」"it's too sweet"       Yui is Haruno's foil   Since the beginning. Since Chiba Mura end. Haruno already knew that Yui will be a needle in her plan. Hence she showed unfavorable response to Yui, occasionally      Was that where 2ch was getting the idea that maybe he was rejecting her? Effectively saying "She's not bad, but too sweet for my tastes"  Related to that, how many times could the sweet/naive wordplay be a factor in that scene?       一色の声と一緒に、頬をかすめてスプーンが口に突っ込まれる。突然の出来<wbr>事にもごっとまごつき、目を白黒させていると、その明滅する視界の中で、一<wbr>色が蠱惑的に笑った。</wbr></wbr>  「先輩、こういう甘いの、お嫌いですか？」  スプーンをふりふりしながら、小首を傾げ、一色は上目遣いにこちらを見る<wbr>。いたずらに成功した子供のように得意げな口元の微笑みと、女の子らしく挑<wbr>発的に胸を張る姿はアンバランスで、だからこそひどく魅力的に映る。</wbr></wbr>   I'm cumming bucket now. God blesses Watari-sama.        That's where some of them were coming from, yeah. But then again, others just said that they're trying to read too much into it, that 8man is not going to BTFO somebody like that.      ていうか、そのスプーンさっき使ってやつじゃないの……、そういうことさ<wbr>れるとほんと心臓に悪いからやめてほしい……。</wbr>   Suck this denialfag, it's clearly stated that Iroha had used it before, and 8man is conscious about it.       Now that you mention it, I like that interpretation a lot. It ties in his answer to her question with the last line of the conversation very nicely.  Only thing that it leaves me wondering about is the "answer she was waiting for" bit though. On one hand it carries implications, but on the other it sounds kinda lewd.  I also have a foggier idea about the nuance of the scene now.        The waifufagging and shipping in these threads is absolutely intolerable. I stayed out of Yahari threads for the first half of the season until I caught up with the LNs and I came backing thinking there might be decent threads like before the anime aired, how stupidly mistaken was.   Do you fags actually enjoy spending your time on this shit?     so what do you think "...I don't hate it though" mean?     &gt;She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.   &gt;"Even so, my answer is the same."   &gt;"Is that so..."   &gt;Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.   &gt;"Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;8 man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.  &gt;"Too sweet...   He lied to her. Iroha ship sinking.             Do you fags actually enjoy spending your time on this shit?  Nah, but for some reason I always ended up in this place anyway.       Now we're going back to ground zero in their scene with no proper conclusion. This is when informality becomes a huge issue. People are supporing either side both here and in 2ch because of Watari's way of writing that.        「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."  Shouldn't it be 「……嫌いじゃねぇけど...」or 「……嫌いじゃねぇ, けど...」 for that translation?     Pure love.     I have no doubt Watari wrote it deliberately to be ambiguous.  Sort of like Yukino's purported "I have become aware of Hachiman" line.        because of Watari's way of writing that.  Maybe it's intentional that he made it ambiguous? Watari is certified troll that like to rile up his fanbase.     So, Iroha ship is on the limbo right now? If that's so, then we'll have our answers only on volume 12.     Every ship is on the limbo, they've always been there since the start.  Watari is a troll, a cocktease and a possible hack.  News at 11.      Does it matter? Look at  It is not something negative and coffee max is sweet as fuck.      yukino is going to win  Nothing changed indeed.     Yukinofags unite. All enemy shitposters shall choke on their keyboards when Yui and Iroha get rejected by the 8man,    I really don't see how you can call that a rejection. Quite the opposite in fact, as 嫌いじゃない is often used as a confession-LITE. For the LN to spend that huge amount of time setting up Iroha and 8man only for him to go "thanks but no thanks" and drop her into obscurity would just be shoddy writing.   Also something worth mentioning, the entire "sweetness" metaphor used in that conversation is most likely a reference to 8man's date with Iroha in 10.5, during which he makes a bunch of "sugar and spice" metaphors about her. (Including saying she has "a bit of excess spice in her")  So in 10.5 8man says he's she's sweet and a little too spicy. In 11 he says she's too sweet, but he doesn't dislike it. What does it mean?        Why even bother?. This bowl was over from episode/volume 1. It's either her or no one.     「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."  That should be tranlated as "...I don't dislike/hate it though". There's no comma splitting the sentence, nor ellipsis at the end of the sentence, so you can't get that "but..." meaning    Alright, just woke up from a come from 3 weeks.  What have I missed?  Did Iroha win?       I just want to see Iroha get rejected   The raw version makes me think he says "too sweet" as "too much to be believed".  Damn I really can't put it into words the right term.       character to be developed last   winning       First half of v11 has a bunch of Iroha flags Second half is yukinoshitas drama, 3some date, Yui going all out and Yukino finally deciding to say what she wants after 8man called all of them out for being not genuine.     I understand your point anon, but you're reading far too much into it. He simply says "Too sweet" and he doesn't dislike it.   Is there really gonna be only 1 more volume left? There's way too much shit for just 1   I wouldn't necessarily say we're "back" at ground zero. The scene implies big things in regards to Iroha either way, it's just not entirely clear to what end. In that sense we're much further along than before the LN came along.  And really, we've made a lot of progress from "holy shit they're basically having sex with sweetness metaphors Iroha won!" and "no fuck you this can't possibly be real!"       Did Iroha win?   She lost, 8man is not genuine with her.     What are these faces trying to convey? It's just harmless giri choco   http://peace.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>bookall/1435077524/262  Lots of nips seem to believe that Yui has the highest chance of winning right now because of 8man's reaction after he received Yui's cookies.  Also kinda funny how they nicknamed Yukino Copypaste-non,  because apparently in one scene she repeated what 8man said.     </wbr>   So guys, what do you expect 1) a weak love triangle in the background 2) brutal and traumatizing love triangle 3) no love triangle     We still have the VN brothers , right?    Not harmless when the person you're interested in gets choco from another bitch. It's serious business. If they had AKs they would use them.     Well, it's 1 problem per volume so it will be enough. Will probably end at their spring time of their third years.      winning right now because of 8man's reaction   How he reacted?      Second, but it leads to bittersweet friendship end with hints of future romance    Nothing was stated in the afterword, so it's likely vol 12 isn't the final volume    It went something like  Komachi? You mean the rice?  which is perfectly understandable.  Next I suppose you'll be defending "chalk and let" and "rice krispy treats"?        Chocolate is serious fucking business in Japan.     Orimoto never said it was giri. Also if they knew 8man once liked her there would be hell to pay. Yui may defer to Yukino and vice versa but I doubt the would let in another girl. Why do you think Iroha still keeps up the Hayama facade?      ITT: no Yahallo!   What happened?       I still can't consider you as a boyfriend   But maybe we can be friends?  It's giri choco.       because apparently in one scene she repeated what 8man said.  What did she say?     Most of the Yuifags are skellytons now    I know it is giri choco, 8man knows it too. Yukino and Yui don't know it is giri.    2ch is Yui Central. It's inevitable that they'll think that.  I personally consider her more likely than Yukino, but I can't see her currently winning against Iroha without some main heroine plot armor asspullery. The Iroha spoon scene was just too big of a deal.      We're just waiting until vol 11 storm blows over because yukinofags will not let up gloating on Yui.    Orimoto really wasn't that convincing when she said it. There's no way she'd drop the DAYONE act and be genuine with 8man without getting addicted.    What do you mean addicted?    If it was such a big deal, the anime would have focused on it more. It's not.    To be honest, I consider Iroha has the lowest chance of winning considering she's not even involved in the main drama that revolves around the relationship between the main characters.    It was cut (replaced with non-canon Tamanawa, more accurately) specifically because it's a big deal. The LN hadn't come out yet.     big of a deal.   So big deal almost nobody talks about Iroha on 2ch.      Read carefully   2ch is Yui Central. It's inevitable that they'll think that.       Then we can throw everything sensei said out of the window.     2ch is yuifag central   almost nobody talks about Iroha there  Well no shit.      Deluded    Assmad     Someday finally happened   Threesome   Yay! I guess?       iroha fans are the funniest.   Why didn't 8man pin her down and coat the inside of her womb against her will?   Yeah this confirms it. There may not be a Yui end but there won't be a simple Yukino end.     the thread so fast.  Yahallobros only posting in fresh bread.  Even hayamacunt cant keep the pace.       By your post I can guess that burgerland is waking up.     smearing dick with shit  8man knows better.      Also kinda funny how they nicknamed Yukino Copypaste-non,   because apparently in one scene she repeated what 8man said.   Is this the dependency issue people keep talking about? Like admiring Haruno before and now 8man?       Yes.    Yep, that's it.  8man also told her not to be too reliant on others.  [character development.exe]        It's like she doesn't like to think for herself so she lets other people do the thinking for her.    Is she going to cut her hair too? Little haruno incoming.    50% yes    Haruno &gt; shit &gt; Yukino    What happened to your body, Haru-san-senpai?      I can't into translation but this is roughly what happen:   8man:"let's calm down for now and talk about this tomorrow, give her a call just in case"    Yukino:"K."    Yukino:"Moshi moshi Nee-san? let's calm down for now and talk about this tomorrow, I gave you a call just in case." (Exact same wording)             That's because the story revolves around the club, not the romance. Romance within the club has been treated as a secondary issue early on, and later on a major problem by the story and the characters throughout the series. As of Vol 11 it still seems to be the case and we're looking at maybe one or two volumes left before the series ends.  8man's romantic development with both club members is pretty weak, and Watari investing precious narrative space on developing him with Iroha only undermines that further. Considering Destinyland was barely 2 volumes ago it would be very questionable both from a pacing and a narrative standpoint if someone from the club were to, for instance, win 8man's heart in Volume 12.      What a creep.    If I was 8man right there I would be scared.      It's understandable, but it's retarded. Is there a type of rice called "komachi" known to English speakers? I certainly don't know any. The Japanese dialog is something along the lines of "こまち？だれですか、おこめ？" It's a "joke" made because of the phonetic resemblance between こまand こめ. You can't convey what goes on there to English speakers by translating it literally, even if you can convey the meaning in a half-assed way. Commie's choice was a good one, it was actually better than WW's writing too. Translation isn't only about making things understandable, it's about giving them flavor once they're translated.         I still think there has to be some kind of irony in here, considering 8man cried in front of Yukino to get her to help him not very long ago at all.    You have a point but honestly we'll only know on volume 12. Iroha will either show up briefly and disappear into nothingness, confirming the 'rejection' in the spoon scene or she will get a lot of romantic development and seal the deal, confirming 8man stepping over the line on the spoon scene and flirting with her. The actual v-day did not arrive yet so we'll see what happens 7 months from now.  Personally, I'm expecting the worst. That's just something that I've learned from reading the yahari novels.   Also, good night anons.            won't be a simple Yukino end.  So if there is a Yukino end it would have to take a lot of building up to it? Doesn't the fact that she openly admits to her dependency and wants to change it imply she is already on the road to recovery? 8man already said he ain't putting up with it.  Also does Yukino realize she has feelings for him yet?       In truth 8man doesn't like Yuckyno. It's why he didn't kiss her at infirmary scene.     Commie's choice was a good one, it was actually better than WW's writing too   We don't need to follow the source material, we're better than the source material!   Why not just do it properly and put in a TL note?          What happened? Why does she need to calm down?      こまち？だれですか、おこめ？" It's a "joke" made because of the phonetic resemblance between こまand こめ   Talking out of your ass   http://www.ak.zennoh.or.jp/rice/lin<wbr>eup.html  Fucking 2 seconds in google.  The direct translation delivers the joke precisely.    </wbr>       I hate Commie with a passion but TL notes are just as bad.    He would have but Yukino didn't let him kiss her.    Yukino is on autopilot, that's why someone need to shake her off.    And here I thought dependency was just a buzzword used for waifu war purposes.    Fuck off  You too  8man is the one making distance, but that's just his anti-romance autopilot working, not because he hates Yukino.        So you hate literally every proper LN (and novel) translation ever written?    That isn't not respecting the source material though. If you claim that it is, then any and all translation is.    I DIDN'T READ THE POST  While it is true that the joke isn't actually about phonetics,  Is there a type of rice called "komachi" known to English speakers? I certainly don't know any.   So yes, a direct translation delivers the joke precisely, by mentioning the name of a rice not a single person in the West has heard of. Definitely some high quality comedy right there. You're really good at this anon! You should work for CR.            no dependency issues they said   haruno is just jealous they said      You fuck off, shippershit.   sp, when do we make the Yahari+Nisekoi Cucks Anonymous General thread?    it was actually better than WW's writing too   That isn't not respecting the source material though   0/10         haruno is just jealous they said   This. I'm already having the idea alot of Yukinofags does not know how to read.       Why doesn't he autopilot when it comes to Iroha?    he probs means getting addickted to the 8inch     he doesn't realize the fact that the Coma Cheese joke could be made in Japanese in the exact same way   "whatever I don't agree with/cannot understand must be trolling!!"   ok kid       She loves Hayama-senapi.   Also anyone else think it is funny that Yui's ship didn't sink and only got stronger?      Weren't you ever watch the show?     Speaking of which, is 11 the only volume we have in 2015? We have a pretty solid chance at seeing the ending this year.     The actual v-day did not arrive yet  it did. v-day is the day Komachi took on the entry test, and the 3p date took place.  It's just not ended, that's it/  So Irohafags can still hope.        Iroha work too fast for him to react against.  Remember, despite what he boasted, he's a loner with minimum social experience. Having a girl that aggressive around him fucked his pace.   Second heroine. If Watari fuck her progression too much he has no future in publishing.         I'm going to bet another novel in 6 months. Last year, we got 10.5 in place of 11.     Backpedaling   You already got caught shitting false information everywhere, and you should feel embarassed, just FYI. We've already shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that replacing that line with a pun was a pure and simple mistranslation, since there was no punning present in the dialog.  Anyways, dont' underestimate the intelligence of the viewer. When I watched this scene in HS it was pretty obvious there's a type of rice called komachi which led to the misunderstanding. Not the funniest joke in the world, but at least it was comprehensible dialog.  Commie will continue to translate yen as dollars, mochi as jelly donuts, and taro as rice krispy treats. Also, chalk and let.          The actual v-day did not arrive yet    volumes are supposed to be split off by months   Okay Watari what the fuck are you going to do now?      So are we in full love triangle mode?   Unless I am reading this wrong 8man said no to Yui swallowing her feelings and he told Yukino to not be dependent. Yui makes his heart skip a beat and Yukino acknowledges her problem.     It's no use, hope is just something that will destroy us even more. Davy Jone's cage is closing, but I'm staying on this sunken ship.   See . Volume ended during v-day it seems.       Commie Defense Force is in full swing today     the club burned V-day on a 3p date   Doesn't this pretty much destroy their chances? Lumping themselves together into a group is basically the biggest romantic death flag a heroine can have.        people watch FFF subs      She loves Hayama-senapi.  8man doesn't seem to think so.     Aren't you tired asking the same question over and over? Why don't you just read the thread to find out?    who knows, Watari sure had his own reason to write mock date, indirect kiss, the rejections, Hayato "her feeling is probably for someone else" and other shit.   Before the story actually end, we can always hope for an unexpected end  and that genius writer sill exists        Crap, what the heck? She sure is cute. She’s like the school academy’s idol! It’s Iroha-chan, you know! It wouldn’t be unnatural if that actually happened… No, it definitely would be.     That slyness and cuteness, however, was directed at Hayama Hayato, and not me, so I was able to stay composed. I’mma pretty darn sure I’d fall for her first trap had I been the same as my pure and younger self, ya know…?     By intentionally thinking in a different accent, I faced my identity as a citizen of Chiba, solidifying my love for my hometown and was able to calm down. Phew, close one. If it wasn’t for my love for Chiba, Irohasu’s slyness would’ve completely annihilated me. Thank you, Chiba. I love you, Chiba.   As long as Iroha keeps her 'going for Hayama' facade 8man's defenses are lowered.           backpedaling  How is it backpedaling when I responded to your objection right off the bat in the first place? My assertion was valid in both cases, and I admitted that one of the cases was wrong. The other isn't, and my assertion stands.  We've already shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that replacing that line with a pun was a pure and simple mistranslation, since there was no punning present in the dialog.  You sure did. You didn't show anything, you're just thinking that the pun replacement equates into a mistranslation when it isn't. You obviously don't know anything about translation and have never translated anything.  When I watched this scene in HS it was pretty obvious there's a type of rice called komachi which led to the misunderstanding.  Again that doesn't matter at all because... I already explained why.  This must be summer, there's no other explanation. People weren't this pathetic even when the "get a feeling so complicated" line appeared in Commie's S1 translations.           I'd watch Hadena over Commie. And that's exactly what I did.   Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon S1 was misery       I get no answers to that question   I am currently working on a theory that Iroha doesn't like Hayama and actually likes 8man.       Why would you ever subject yourself to that?     people entitled to THEIR subs on a schedule THEY set   Commie makes fun of these people     it's actually fucking hilarious too   EOPs man          defending Eotens      Maybe, still in the end it's clearly that they thought that "genuine thing" 8man is searching for is romantic feeling. So they are openly aiming for his dick now.   And it's silly to say 8man doesn't have any special feelings for the two beautiful girls he spent a whole year with.      I'm not defending Eotens. What, just because I appreciate Commie's translation for Yahari you thought that I appreciate everything they do?     not finding the internet funny   using 4chan      You would have had to be there to understand what kind of a hell it was. And I'm not just talking about Hadena subs either, Commie was really not much of an improvement.  Not even the nips could figure out what was going on in that show. Someone basically had to make a website with a guidebook spelling out everything that was happening in each episode.      Why does he always draw clothes so they look wet?     watch FFF subs for Hoozuki no Reitetsu   pretty good   watch CR subs for that one episode where Prince Shotoku and Zhuge Liang are put in a Street Fighter IV style VS screen   CR's TL note says that the 2 characters are Japanese strategists or something like that        &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/    The same reason why he draws 2 left feet    Daily reminder that Zhuge Liang A SHIT.    I thought the fact they were all together on said day and what he says during the date reinforces that there will be romance and that both of them have a shot.   8man isn't the kind of person who should be in the middle of a love triangle between best friends. Why did they equate genuine = my pussy?        their subs are shit EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE  Every Commie discussion ever.     Hey hey, it's all part of his PLAN.     &gt;"not even Heaven can save him from this trap now!   &gt;it starts raining      I can't click gray links anon.    What did he say, exactly? I thought all he does is reject Yui's proposal for them to just remain friends as a rule of sorts.  As for how they interpreted the GENUINE to be romantic is baffling to me as well, as he clearly directed it to both of them. They're just seeing what they want to see, I think.      Did I ever say "except this one"? I said that this translation isn't shit and that not all of their translations are good.    If you guys spent the time learning moon instead of fighting over subs, you wouldn't need subs   because he is just a teenage boy?     S1 goes   I understand it   S2 starts   suddenly they are selling Meat for no fucking reason at all   there's a war now   and then not   I know anon, I know           Commie is fucking retarded. They inserted "rice crispy treats" as something plain a child wouldn't like. Holy fuck.     muh krispie     Holy fuck don't even get me started about the meat.  That anime adaptation made about as much sense as King Crimson.      Taro isn't something plain a child wouldn't like either though, IMO. Just raw taro maybe, but even dried taro is very tasty let alone any sort of sweet thing made with it.     Epic fail.    Why, SURELY eroge protag patterns wouldn't backfire. If you're aiming for the harem end (if applicable) it's hard to make all the right choices the first time around, but it's generally pretty easy to focus one girl.     Asian children actually eat those caramelized crispy rice. They eat it like a candy treat. They even add different coloring to them.    http://exhentai.org/g/826973/a338ef<wbr>5065/  oh baby  </wbr>  What is Kumiko saying to Shu1?    i also masturbated to you before    She admitting that she will never get the part down.   That's actually Reina talking to Shu1 in that shot.   In the name of St. Kaori.   I'm a gay homosexual lesbian and Reina is my girlfriend    Died for all our  Reina's  sins    tfw can't sleep because Midori is just too cute.   Send help    Nothing. Reina caught Shuichi talking shit about Taki Sensei, and Kumiko is now looking at her.     The patron saint of talentless hacks.      She's my favourite background character.  Praise kyoani for cute background waifus.      umaku naritai     When does it get good, you faggots lied to me    Have all of you taken your daily time to thanks KyoAni?   She deserves more screen time.     You guys must be fun at parties.     Show me your bussy    I'll fight you fagott.      I wish the anime went over the reason why she considered backing Kaori in the audition. Both she and Hazuki are given such little screentime as it is, it's unfortunate when good scenes that they do have get cut.  But maybe KyoAni's just saving the scene for something else.     Don't talk about Taki-Sensei in front of the crazy bitch, she almost killed me last time I did.   I want to be almost killed by Reina.    Hey, did you know Satoshi saw your dick?     At this point im wondering what her purpose even is. What does she and Hazuki do in the later novels?    realisticfag gtfo pls    Can you blame him? He was  __gay__.      I wish the anime went over the reason why she considered backing Kaori in the audition.  But they did. Are you actually watching the show?     Being the closest case with the hopeless crush on a superior specimen who couldn't care less is suffering.    Praise the potato    Why does Kyoani like to bully gays so much?     Which Hibike have you masturbated to?    spreading gossip about sensei and senpai  Typical band faggot.    It's over /u/ status: destroyed. Now they're just pathetically wishing for an open-ended end and that Kumiko won't show hints that she likes him next episode.    Goto.    Competition piece: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Tt<wbr>lMmSLJcU</wbr>  [ ]  What do you think /a/?       All dem neets fapping to their shitty oboe waifu   Smh    Like poetry   Flat ass.

I'm honestly bewildered by these comments.    /u/ is awful.    Why? All of those posts are accurate.    After seeing how Reina acted towards Kumiko when she heard she was alone with Taki-Sensei, you would have to be completely insane to believe she has any romantic interest in anyone besides Taki-Sensei.  Even if they made a yuri bait scene ten times as pandering as the episode 11 one, it still won't mean even an "open end", since the only way they could make it more clear that Reina wants Taki D is by having her fuck table-kun while looking at a picture of Taki-Sensei.      I should have waited for next week. MIDI is just so awful it doesn't do justice to actual playing. I think it will be great though.    Reina.    You misunderstood that scene. Reina was actually jealous that Kumiko was alone with a man at night.  Based KyoAni knows how to keep the bait ambiguous, just like Reina's weird face in episode 5.      Why must all threads be like this? Can you just appreciate a nice pair? I'm not even a yuri-fag but Reniaxkumiko is cute, and honesty it would of been fine if it went childhood friend route,   But God damn, just enjoy it, you can't look anyone in the eye and honestly claim yuri-bait after episode 11       Sorry, I refuse to believe these are genuine opinions of rational people.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Pcn<wbr>BIGMRdHs</wbr>  [ ]   That looks quite tasty.   I'm going to marry Kumiko!     What's the point of those shows?    Of course you are, Reina.    I'm going to marry Natsuki!        Shuichi's worst nightmare. Or maybe his dream, I don't know.    How can it be his if she's only had sex with Reina?    Reina never acted jealous over Kumiko. She sperged out several times when Taki-Sensei was mentioned. She only freaked out after she heard Taki's name mentioned. There was nothing ambigous here.   Episode 11 scene was explained as a continuation of episode 8 banter a billion times already. Look at how Kumiko and Reina acted in these past five episodes outside of those scenes. They acted as friends. Kumiko was weirded out by Reina's confession for Taki, not jealous or heartbroken. If ep11 was Kumiko returning Reina's love, why did they act as friends and not partners in episode 12?       Because it gets annoying to hear people repeatedly claim Kyoani will purposely change the pairing in an adaptation. Never mind the fact that the current volume has zero romantic development, never mind that Kyoani has been very faithful in their adaptations, never mind that changing the pairing while still only on volume 1 of 4 is momentally stupid, it just gets annoying when the only reason anyone actually wants the lesbian pairing isn't because it's progressive or part of their character development, but because they just want to see two girls getting it on.    I mean the reason about what she realized in middle school. Did you actually finish reading my post?     Get good you fucking scrub.    Again, you misunderstood. Reina freaked out because she didn't want Kumiko to be with a man. She had the same reaction in episodes 5 and 8 (regarding Shuuichi in the latter).  Her "rabu" is actually just admiration for Taki-sensei, and her "ai no kokuhaku" is true homosexual love for Kumiko. Also, partners do act like friends, they aren't lovey-dovey all the time.  All of this was planned out very carefully by KyoAni. They'll bait everyone until the end, and they'll never make another season or movie.         would of   Learn2english       Kyoani has been very faithful in their adaptations  Heh. Also Anon, have you read the novels, or at least the one this season is based on? Because I imagine it would help you form your opinion on this matter.   but because they just want to see two girls getting it on.  When has this been the case ever?          this level of desperate /u/ damage control   Keep 'em coming, just keep 'em coming     I love the track at 4:03, what's the title called?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=11&amp;<wbr>v=YHYWAXFvs0Q</wbr>  [ ]  Also, slightly pressured Red Ribbons is also good.      So does the /u/ camp of /a/ have it this crazy compared to other places? I'm tempted to peek at other forums to see how they feel about the yuri teasing in it all.  Fuck it. Let's see what I can find.      you can't look anyone in the eye and honestly claim yuri-bait after episode 11   I'm not even a yuri-fag  Stop lying and fuck off        No versions of playing bad    FUCKING KYOANI YOU BETTER GIVE ME A S2/MOVIE OR ELSE I'LL FUCKING KILL MYSELF I'M FUCKING SERIOUS HERE   Damn you are hairy.    Other forums pretty much unanimously support the yuri. Only /a/ has these unruly hetfags, perhaps because they spill over from the SJW backlash on /v/.    That fig is so shitty   Which section would you join and why?   How can you wear those fucking dirty shoes? Are you literally poor or 16 years old?     Wearing shoes inside the house  Pls.     Hibike yurifags are far more dominant in other forums, since it's seen as "progressive" to demand a lesbian pairing in the name of "queer representation" and all that jazz. Anybody who disagrees too vehemently can be easily bludgeoned into submission and/or silence by accusations of homophobia. Basically, if you want a straight pairing and visit any other forum, you just don't dare to speak up for fear of social repercussions. /a/ doesn't have this problem, of course, since everybody is anonymous, can say whatever he likes and generally doesn't give a shit about other people. Which is why /a/ is and always has been superior to other forums, no matter how much shitflinging goes on around here.    Reina is actually yelling at Shoe1 for talking about Taki-sensei.  Here's the full image.      Double reeds. I'd slowly come between Kurumi and the other fagott until after graduation at which point Kurumi and I would go to the same college and right fagott would be forgotten forever.     Wanna make "music together" with Reina and me?     Do you also go into the basement to laugh?    yeah good try, but it's easy to see your pic is photoshopped  just compare shuuichi's mouth to the one in OP's image      /u/fags are hilarious    THIS IS NO JOKE     6 days until this.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rBM<wbr>E62reb5Y#t=54</wbr>  [ ]    Is Drills-chanXTromboner-kun the best kyoani romance ever?

I know I'm probably a moron for taking this post seriously, but it's not like I have anything better to do. And some people do seem to believe this.   Reina freaked out because she didn't want Kumiko to be with a man.   She freaked out specifically after hearing Taki-Sensei's name, and started ignoring everything Kumiko was babbling about. It wasn't the man part, or the alone part, it was Taki part. She has never shown a reaction this serious towards anything non-Taki related. Compare all the other reactions Reina had towards people talking about Taki-Sensei.   She had the same reaction in episodes 5 and 8 (regarding Shuuichi in the latter).  Episode 5 scene was, again, about Taki-Sensei. Smiling about Shuichi in episode 8 was indicative of her sharing the same opinion Hazuki does - that Kumiko is in love with Shuichi and in denial of her feelings. They've known each other since middle school, after all.   Her "rabu" is actually just admiration for Taki-sensei, and her "ai no kokuhaku" is true homosexual love for Kumiko.  "Ai no kokuhaku" line is straight from the novels. Where they're platonic friends. It's just chuuni talk. The idea that rabu was just admiration is nonsensical, she literally pointed out and clarified her stance. She is in romantic love with him. If it was just admiration, it would not have been done this way.   Also, partners do act like friends, they aren't lovey-dovey all the time.  They weren't lovey-dovey even once. They weren't lovey-dovey in private, when there was no one around them. They acted just as friends. And this was shortly after they supposedly confessed to each other. There would have been a lot more nervousness and romantic tension - and there was literally none. You don't act like friends when you're all alone with your first teenage love the very next day after you confess to each other. Even their private talk was one-upmanship - if you become special I'll become even more special. No mention of being special together.                Two beautiful 18 year old girls holding hands?  As the ancient Hawaiians used to say, time for a dicking!      Maybe some people here actually like the het couples for themselves, and not as a reaction to the SJWs?     They never even spoken to each other.     I play euphonium so I'd join them.     seriously responding to a troll post     it literally reads in the description, step it up anon, Ishiki no Houga   19.意識の萌芽       Anon, you high?    I'm literally 99.99% sure it's a troll post but then I see something like  and I'm not so sure anymore.  I can only imagine how awful it must be on other sites if  and  are even remotely true. I'd like to believe they aren't.      whatever, straightfags or even normies, but not /u/r fucking imported tumblr lingo  if you wanna talk about how much "het" disgusts you, there's a perfectly shitty site called tumblr readily available to /u/      It's tame compared to here. That is, if one isn't an idiot for not realizing it's mostly shitposters stirring trouble here.     Don't waste your time man   I want to marry this person.   Reina, please.    Kumiko please.    Go back to practice, Reina    Hazuki and Sapphire listed as main characters   Even less screentime than several side characters  When will they get their revenge?    I'm glad Natsuki has taken up the banter mantle now that Kumiko has deserted her post.    Thanks, tovarisch.      When the Battle Royale begins on stage.    WHAT      trips for truth, the NTR is real    In their spinoff series    luscious lips     Fuck you Kyoani, where's my beach episode?   OVA    Sensei takes them to beach to relax after the competition.    what a relentless bitch    Please don't insult the happy couple.      I fucking wish   Reina x Kumiko   Give me your crack pairings        Book 2 had a pool scene. We'll just have to wait for s2.  So, never.    I want to break Reina's heart.   Despite her appearances she looks like the sensitive type.    So now /u/ fags settle for crack pairing RibbonNatsuki?      People still caring about Reina/Kumiko when Ribbons/Natsuki is the hottest shit around.       She looks like yandere. After she realized that Kumiko NTRed her, she will probably cut off Taki's head and show it to Kumiko.    What is she doing?   She's just asking to be raped and impregnated.   Keep that ribbon slut away from my 10/10 qt    Why not? Is it disrupting your "I want to fuck Natsuki" shitposting?   Who /fuck kumiko/ here? not Shitichi, that's for sure.   Delicious sailor Taki.    NO    Situation is still salvageable.   <br/>     only 1 knife   Pleb. High-tier yanderes duel wield.       Shoeitchy is such a pathetic little shit, that's for sure. Wants to go out with Kumiko, but then he's never there for her when she's having trouble and could need some emotional support. Fuck him. I'm glad he's getting NTR'd by Taki, he deserves it.     implying it was an unrequited love  They have hot hot drill sex every night     *dual        anti/u/ autists still mad at another board   Still obsessed enough to go to a board they hate about a subject they hate and whine about the users being disappointed in the lack of the subject they like in a show with pandering for that subject.   This is like going to /v/ when they still had anime threads and obsessively screenshotting their reactions to whatever shounen shit they like at the time.  What the fuck is wrong with you          I'd like you to remember that /u/fags started that retarded war when they flooded /a/ with their "hetfag BTFO" shit after episode 8 had aired. They deserve all backlash they receive.   inb4 b-but that was just falseflagging I swear        Still obsessed about shitposting that happened weeks ago.   Get the fuck over it and stop being obsessed with /u/ you autismal fuck       The only way /a/ opens up to Rbbons is, her walking the yuri path.      fuck  You don't fuck the Kumiko, you make passionate love to her.      B-but they're the one who started this REEEEEEE      they started it!    this shit again   this shit AGAIN        They talk about the show and what they think of the KumikoxReina ship. The Seyuu of Kumiko said they like each other, or more like that's what she thinks.   I thought the guy in the trumpet section didn't pass the audition.   Hetfags are still mad they got trolled by people pretending to be yurifags in Love Lab threads.   MidoriXmelonpan OTP.  Quite certain Kindergarteners aren't allowed here.   Every boy in the band made the audition because they're not slackers.    Because she's usually a huge bitch but gets flustered when Natsuki is around   ALL THESE REINA JELLY over Kumiko spending time alone with Taki. Hahahaha    I'm a fan of yuri and I even post on /u/ from time to time. Not too often, I made maybe 10, 15 posts there in the last month, and only like two of those were in /u/ H!E threads, so it's not like I only post there because of this anime.  You don't need to be a yurihater to think that the idea of an anime original yuri end at this point is beyond absurd and want to know how can people still hope for it.   Those are just shitposters, idiot. People who know you get easily upset over yuri since you associate with SJW/tumblr/whatever and act obnoxiously to make you dislike yuri fans even more. Then people like you start shitting on yuri fans, and the legitimate yuri fans get upset and start shitting on your kind, and then it's a vicious cycle of shitposting. If you didn't fall for the bait none of this would happen. The original shitposters will just get bored and move on to a different target.  Also, it's stupid to equate between /u/ and /a/ yuri fans. Most /a/ yuri fans seem to utterly despise /u/ because of the Western content there, and most /u/ posters think of /a/ being almost as bad as /v/ these days and avoid this board like a plague.           Hetfag BTFO was clearly /sp/ posters funposting.    Reina more like REEEEEEEEEEEina, amirite fellas?    I swear they're probably women because only a scorned woman would still be mad over shit that happened almost two years ago   Why the fuck are you obsessively taking screenshots then? There's no point other than to stir shit. Their opinions are honestly irrelevant and not worth mentioning in the long run.   So some fucks on another board has hope for another outcome for the show and it's likely that some of those fucks don't even post here?  Who cares            "y-you wanna smell my armpits? why?"      because of the Western content there  Interesting, I remember that when I stopped going to /u/ a few years ago, there was a lot of shitflinging over Western content being allowed or not. So that's where the scales fell.      Natsuki stuttering   You don't watch this show, do you?      Yurifaggots tend not to give a shit about personalities when it comes to their shipping.    This.  I find it funny than no one on /u/ actually gave a damn about Love Lab after learning the premise and checking the manga, but on /a/ threads had so many shitposters whining why it's not full yuri etc. all the time.  And seeing /u/ board posts about this Hibike show and then checking /a/ threads, the only correct conclusion is that /a/ trolls itself with phantom yurifags, once playing the role of them and then doing reverse and scorning them.       Both /u/fags and hetfags are cancer.   Musicbros  are where it's at. We won this episode, boys!      Tell the mod moot create /lgbt/ for a reason.     Not really. That one pixiv faggot prove otherwise.   He was talking to Illumi, right?   Yes.    Yes.  Who was that random person in the background of the Heavens Arena arc who called out Killua's name?     I wonder how Illumi and Hisoka met.   Likes attract    Heavens Arena maybe? Since Killua was sent there as a child it might be a Zoldyck tradition and Hisoka seemed comfortable at the Heavens Arena.      yfw this cruel beast is a Floor Master when Heavens Arena is revisited      I still feel dirty for ever liking Wing. Never would have guessed that he's a pedophile.     manipulator   training to be a pure martial artist         It says "You're retarded"     Honestly he seems like an enhancer with how determined and single minded he is at training.    Hisoka said himself that the personality thing wasn't 100% reliable.    So then Killua isn't fickle and he still loves Gon they just need some time apart!   Has there been any info on Togashi since September or whenever he announced his hiatus?   No, Killua is legitimately, objectively and empirically a shit.    Killua sucks.     But if he doesn't still love him why'd he go through that trouble to save him, and why did he STILL feel the need to have Leorio and pals not tell Gon that it was Killua who saved him?     To hold it over Gon and make him feel guilty. He even said "you owe me" to him.    were that his goal he wouldn't have told them not to tell him      he just has autism anon, this is how he expresses his love    reminder that gon saved killua without expecting anything in return   How can anyone like this self-centered dumb drama queen faggot who doesn't realize his own mistakes and instead choses to blame others is beyond me.   Well before the CA arc is when he gets you, then you try to forgive everything in the late CA arc and election arc.    I don't blame people for their mental disabilities, he can't help being autistic.    Kawaii    they mistook his thoughts as actual narration, and never caught onto the fact that it was disconnected from what was actually happening    Characters without flaws are not interesting anon    under 5'2"   thug     It's because he's a flawed but well written character?    What?     same height as the 10 year old child on your team   gangsta       tfw taller than Feitan     Is that suppose to be impressive?    yes, because I'm 5'2 he's a fucking midge     best onisan    I want to  put  Feitan  in my pocket .    He's not quite. Maximum 4'10" for midgets.     tfw shorter than Feitan     I hope you're a girl. Otherwise holy shit, you're a fucking mega manlet.     Hisoka really is a bro even if he only chooses to be a bro to people he wants to murder in the future.    Not him, but /a/ does seem to have a lot of manlets, I'm 5'4", nothing wrong with being short though,  if you're gay  for all the /a/ manlets that aren't, sorry.     tfw gay and kind of want to be a manlet  not that I'm unhappy with my height     Yeah but Killuafags tend to ignore Killua's flaws.   Why do Kalluto and Alluka wear girl clothes? Did their mum desperately want a daughter? Is it a Zoldyck family tradition for everyone besides the heir? (I'm assuming not since we've seen Alluka and Kalluto in male clothing in the flashbacks but if so, did Illumi and Milluki wear girl clothes as small children?) Did Alluka start it because they wanted to be the little girl and Kalluto copied because he wanted Killua to love him?   Killua hate  I was going to say "Killua did nothing wrong" but I know he made a lot of mistakes. Like letting Gon delude himself, never telling him his true feelings and then getting upset because Gon isn't a mind-reader and so but eveybody is being too harsh on him. Seeing his best friend sacrifice himself, carring what's basically his corpse on his back and then see him wither away must have been a traumatic experience to Killua and just like Gon, he's only a 12 years old boy that went through a lot of shit.     I think the kalluto copying alluka one is most accurate    I think that its a backlash against the previous Gonhate. How many people thought that Gon was just being selfish, realizing that a character that they once thought of as an innocent victim wasn't so innocent after all. Part of this comes from reading the actual manga, which makes the difference in Killua's perspective and what's actually going on more obvious. The fact that Gon learns and actually and grows up, while Killua doesn't and even guilt trips Gon, just makes it even worse.  The fact that many Killuafags can't admit to his mistakes without trying to make excuses for him doesn't help.      But Anon, Alluka is a girl so of course she's going to dress like one    I'd just like to point out that Killua did change a lot and grow as a person from the first arc where we see him, but still has to grow.    I miss edgy Killua. He was fun.    Would old Killua be reluctant about killing Pitou right there? Probably not.    While Killua has changed a lot since his first appearance, he hasn't learned anything from the CA arc.     because I'm 5'2  Damn     Killua has too many flaws and not enough likeable traits.    Most if not all characters in HxH are flawed. It doesn't justify Killua's popularity.    leorio will never carry his own arc     implying he won't have his own character arc in the DC     I kinda think that that's Leorio's appeal, that in a world full of increasingly stronger superthreats he's just a guy with a good head on his shoulders who wants to do the right thing.   I'm also guessing the Japs don't like him because he's not the typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon) or at least somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)       in a world full of increasingly stronger superthreats   typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon)   somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)        typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon)   or at least somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)      Oh you're going to get it now.     this entire post        M-m-muh kiddie protag isn't dumb just because he's observant and has a knack for combat!    M-m-muh other protags aren't edgy even though one literally rips people's hearts out and comes from a family of assassins and the other will do anything to get his clan's eyes back, including torture and murder!   Oh yeah, another reason Leorio doesn't get attention. Lack of bloodline. Nips love their family legacy and heritability.   Gon is the son of an incredible hunter     Killua comes from a family of insanely talented assassins    Kurapika comes from a special clan with magic eyes   If Leorio's dad was the world's best doctor or something I'd fucking guarantee they'd like him more.                  In the manga translation I read, somebody in the background says Killua's name.  I guess it was just randomly put there.      I love Leorio but damn your post is embarassing. First of all, he is pretty popular in Japan. Not as popular as the others because he didn't get as much paneltime, but still decently popular.  He even is miss Japan 2013's husbando.  Also, just like the other protagonists, he has a lot of potential, which is the reason why Hisoka didn't kill him.  Also, Gon is pretty far from being typical or dumb, you'd think the CA arc made that clear enough. Just like Killua hasn't been edgy since the first arc, or when Kurapika felt sick after killing Uvo, realized how unfulfilling his revenge was and was angry at himself for putting Gon and Killua in danger.        You must like danmachi    Nothing wrong with being a manlet, it is not like being a lardass     danmachi      Although Kurapika did fully backtrack on that until he met Leorio again  and fucked Mizaistom      It's never said he killed or tortured, and it'd be out of character considering the events of Yorkshin. I don't know where that theory came from.     True, just meant he went edge again.  The cow solves everything.        the pika lost his humanity  ;_;      implying  Leorio might not be a doctor yet but he already knows how to heal     What would happen if Killua went with Kurapika instead of Leorio?     Less suffering, but weaker.      killua in charge of emotional support    Did Pitou die thinking her death mattered and without knowing how Pouf tricked her? That's pretty fucking sad when you think about it.     How did Pouf trick her?     By pretending they got Komugi back.     I swear I love this person soooo much but I'm not going make them feel better  is this the face of autism?       her        The very last beast.   Fuck, why do I've the feeling that kurapika and prince bateman will both die in the fight. Even though he still has some business with the spiders.   Knowing how unpredictable and anti-climatic is togashi.          This meme is still alive?     BECAUSE GON IS MY MOST PRECIOUS FRIEND   treats a mermaid and a squid that he just met better than Gon      I bet Kurapika will die without getting the last of the eyes.  But anyway, the Troupe is coming to the DC too.      i bet that kurapika will be defeat by feitan .     the more he loves someone, the worse he treats them  how long until Alluka has to go through some shit and Killua just watches and blames her afterwards?     If Kurapika manages to get his chains on Feitan quickly without hurting him enough that he can use Burnt by the Sun he might be able to defeat him.     the more he loves someone, the worse he treats them  He must really love his aniki.     nah, he's just scared of and respects him    Post more Pika    No.    The best kind of love.    Just one Pika, use it sparingly.     use sluts sparingly     Pika is not a slut.     Kurapika   slut   not pure incarnate  What an awful post, anon.         flashed a twelve year old boy on a train   not a slut  Whatever you say, there is nothing pure about her, worse yet she's a shotacon.         she   Wait wut.        thinking this 99 filler scene is canon   implying it wasn't accidental anyway and that he didn't hide it immediately afterwards   her   she         Kurapika is a girl.      Whatever you say m8.     I'm almost sure that was '99 anime only.    Might as well be canon, Togashi loved it and only regretted he didn't think of putting it in his manga.    you better give a source    I will need quotations and sources on that.     This is starting to get out of hand, I don't have the source on that interview, but I was exaggerating, when asked about that scene he just said that it made him laugh, he never actually said he loved it or wish he'd used it.       Might as well be canon, Togashi loved it and only regretted he didn't think of putting it in his manga.   No I was only exaggerating   Fuck off cunt.        Oh all right then, carry on.     Makes a lightheated joke in a half dead thread with no actual discussion going on   fuck off cunt  Man, that really escalated quickly. I mean that really got out of hand fast.  Are you going to stab me in the heart?          Die, faggot.        You first.       try to say Kurapika is a girl   say it as if Togashi said it   No no I was only pretending, just joking guys, trust me   Seriously, fuck off.          responding seriously to a post that anyone who isn't retarded would know isn't serious   Seriously, fuck off.       You don't fuck around when it comes to these matters m8.      killuafag AND trapfag  disgusting       Do you have a moment to talk about our wiggling lord and savior?       No, I'm not a faggot.    Post your favorite reaction images this season.                  moshi moshi.      Smug anime girls scare me               When I worked on that same image I was wondering if I should go with her full body or just the face. I chose the latter because it's easier to recognize in the thumbnail. But I admit that it doesn't really look as nice.           bruh          Cyan's faces.          this season     How difficult is it to understand "this season"?     <br/>   They are a good source of reaction pics.                She's got good reason to be smug.            Don't ask for whom the Bellri tolls, he tolls for you.     Isla is a reaction face goldmine.               The entire show is.          please do not bully moe      You mean Zack.   The face of rape  someone post sore aru          mfw finally understanding it       Taaki?    but moe is made for bully                 /u/.jpg     Why does white come off as crazy but she's actually the opposite        She is a gold mine.          Hestia will never beat the meme queen.        literally who    Figuratively you    Did you just try to crash my Firefox? Too bad, my Surface Pro is to gud for that.         what part of this season do you not understand?      Who is this fluid druid    reiko hakamori                      If Shinoa had a cat...      It's impossible to pick just one.   n-nice filename          <br/>    <br/>   I want to fuck that cat.    Is that meant to imply that Chaika is  a boy?         As a waifufag, I can confirm this is true      what the fuck      Anon pls     She didn't react that way inside Yamada's body   Miyamura, Destroyer of the Cunt.      but Miyamura is gay    I fucking knew this would be the second post!       HIBIKEK IS A REACTION GOLDMINE             Hah! Try again.        Please explain... I am clearly too stupid for this.        This thread and  are doing me wonders.  It's kinda from this season      Made this one myself.  And Commeme subs just made it even better   kek       Hestia's Zapp face  My fucking side.     Why does she look so chubby?      ERRA    Haha, what the fuck is happening in this show?    Thats the way the sensor the cok                He is straight for main girl though.              saize      didn't pick up seraph at the start of the season   autism won't allow me to pick up an airing show this late   smug, shortness, purple hair and brown eyes are all fetishes of mine         Is it really that hard?           Why not just DL them all and binge? I'm a few eps behind, and that's my plan.          Like "WTF" man        I like this one but it's a bit too small for regular use.   Wake up, man.         this season     Someone swap sword with a penis and blood on her face with cum drops. The blush can stay.    It was already done    The sword-penis swap would be trivial. But good cum requires a lot off skill and actual work.      Get in nerds    almost no punchline  /a/s shit taste.      I'm working through my backlog. I can't make punchline reaction images before I've reached the anime.     autism       Not the best choice of frame. She is spreading her legs while talking about giving fucks. Somebody might take that the wrong way.         T-Taaki?   i know  Everyone ready to drink Doffyfag tears tomorrow?     ah, thanks    Haha nice meme reaction but it doesn't exclude what you did.. Single handedly ruined OP for me, i'm on impel down atm. If I got my hands on you...     implying Rebecca isn't the one who is going to join     Hey, guys, remember that one time when Oda blew our minds, like in pic related?   Dawn of The Final Day 9 Hours Remain   wkwk  Will Gainax deliver?  I'm scared. I don't want it to end.    No opening   Insert of full version of Stella-rium when Subaru starts to fix everything   You heard it here first folks. My dead finacee worked at GAINAX       finacee      I don't want this ride to end either    Hva you bought strawberry milk for the last episode, /a/?  Please let them remain together in their universe even after the alien and their powers have gone, Gainax!   Like I said, I'm lactose intolerant.     3 hours left     You mean 6. 7,5 until HS.   Hopefully we will get another kissu.   one episode left     KinMoza and SB69 are over   Pleiades to end soon   Etotama and DanMachi will follow too  It it not an end. Just a transformation.        DanMachi will follow  It's not all bad news then.     Danmachi was good.    Good for what it is perhaps, but that's not saying much.    It really wasn't.    Danmachi is just a LN advertisement. The booty in it was good though.    Hestia could only keep me going for four episodes before I dropped it.    Good.  So i can marathon the shit out of this in the mid-seasons week of nothingness.       not being white    Both excited to see how it ends, and sad that it's ending. Somehow this series felt like Gainax really put a lot of heart into making it.   I can't be the only one doing a marathon rewatch before the finale, right?     1 hour 25 minutes remain    I want Gyate Gyate of the Houkagos.     There's no time. I'm re-watching Aquarion and Symphogear.    Until what? It's 80 minutes left according to anichart, but in previous threads, images start appearing 4 hours from now, and HS is out one hour after that.    So is anichart wrong?    Yeah.    Zettai! I've actually done it throughout the past Week because of Work Schedule.   Nanoko's song is so beautiful. So glad I downloaded the singles for the OP and ED.  Where's the stream? Yucie and Neet are dead for me.    Preview https://<span>youtu.be/QEGqRYax6Lk  [ ]   inb4 ends with Subaru opening a door    a fucking black hole   Minato and Subaru together   I'm getting hype.      So 1 hour or 3 hours till it airs? Can I marathon it in time?    3 hours, but you won't have enough time to marathon in   Dat parallel universes. Dat fountain.   I think anin has enough time as long as he is not planning to watch the livestream and wait for subs instead     The spaceship appeared  So the earth is fucked? Inb4 time travel.    I rarely see discussions about Manwha, so I decided to make a little thread it.  I'll start by posting the whore that has pissed me off more than Enju from Dice.    Want a godlike manwha? Go read Shin Angyo Onshi.  gook shit is not /a/ related   So where should we talk about it? Most manga sites have manwha anyways.    Not anime or manga  Dice is the best webtoon.   U misspelled red storm   Anon, would you a ho?  manhwa is horrible. I absolutely hate the current flood of shitty manhwa comics that are more akin to western comics than to manga. They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent. Don't even get me started on chinese ''manga'' which is so bad it makes me wonder if the chinese are invested with any modicum of creativity, if at all.  Stop appropriating Japanese art culture you sub-human gooks no one likes your shit.     It's should be /a/   Because Manhua and Manhwa is literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively. Just like how you don't differentiate between Onee-chan and Sister normally. Anyway I've never seen a janitor 404 a manhua thread yet, not that they usually last very long.       They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent  So, nothing different from manga, then?     This    Ouch, that hurts.    anywhere but here    Tower of god is great, what I don't like is the lame clothes of the character there.      GET THE FUCK OUT OF /A/ YOU GOOKS ! GO READ YOUR SUB-PAR STUPID WEBCOMICS ELSEWHERE      It's hard to take "badass" character seriously when they look like skater punks.   I like manhwa and I read them from time to time, but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters? While the stories are not bad, they tend to drag it so fucking much it gets me fucking angtsy and I just read the wiki. Tower of God, dice, and Girls of the wild and 3 big examples of mad dragging.  Jack Frost is best manhwa.  Daily reminder that The Breaker's team are the biggest bitches in the manwha industry.  Post the zombie hunters.     tower of god   girl backstabbing best boy    we learn that her only motivation is just to watch stars   wtfamireading.jpg       subhuman shit   Fuck off.     Possible 1-2 year hiatus. Why do they do this to us.   Is there something wrong with  Godoka sites?  I am getting ssl_error_rx_record_too_long  Also did you guys read some Chinese Manhwa like Long Hu Men? It didn't have a nice story but still enjoyable.      Just like anything, majority of them are total shit. There's definitely great hidden gems, though most are untranslated.  Gook shit is usually abysmal with a few exceptions, but Tower of god is indeed really good.   I read Chinese Manhua to see them throw sparkly things at each other and shout their moves which can destroy planets and stuff. Most of them are more Dragon ball than Dragon ball and 10x as ridiculous.   Rak is best boy.    I rarely see discussions about Manwha  They happen occasionally. Sometimes they last long. But no one wants to put up with the "lel, gook shit doesn't belong in /a/" despite evidence to the contrary.  Anyways, that reminds me that I haven't read the last two or so chapters of ToG. Also, when was The Gamer supposed to start back up?   Slut. Almost as shit as Rachel.             but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters?  Honestly, who knows? I can only assume they're trying to copy some of the larger manga.  Tower of God makes sense to be fuck long, because of the nature of its story, but Girls of the Wild should have ended ages ago. I pretty much dropped it around the time the shut-in brother was introduced, and I don't know what I even read it that far. Is it seriously still going?       Mod already said it's allowed long time ago, back when /q/ was around. Still won't change people bickering about it though.    Cat girl won. He claimed MC with a kiss and telling him, 'Remember what I said the first time we met? YOU'RE MINE'.     Cat girl won  I do not mind this, actually. Rich girl seemed kind of bland, but the story seemed to be pinning them together. Did he seriously end up with cat girl, or did she just steal a kiss?      All the 'manhwa' you listed are webcomics which run weekly, and 5 years of runtime really isn't that long.  To compensate for the increased workload, they need to fill the comic up with fillers, which is why when you marathon some parts will feel heavily dragged on.      tfw Priest will never get an ending  That movie didn't make things better either.    She stole it, Queen will win because she is the queen.   It's not anime or manga   no 10th dimensional boys anymore     bam finally catches up to rachel   they finally get to talk   she fucking pushes him down again  What the fuck man. Dude just what the fuck.        She truly deserves to rot alone just for the sake of watching stars.    While I don't really follow the newest chapter of Tog but I think that Baam is too clingy, reminds me of Mikasa relationship with Eren.    He seriously had it coming. Did he not see that see that coming? Holy fuck, but it was funny.      I hope to god that Baam finally learned his lesson but considering the retard he is, he probably didn't.  I just want him to be happy with androssi or the pink flame girl, xiaxia, whoever.  Just forget about the whore and climb the tower peacefully until FUG comes to ruin it again.        So what do people think about this? I thought it was pretty interesting to be honest. The story could have been done better, and there's too much left unexplained, but it's still nice to read.    It's pretty damn bad lately. but even ToG or Breaker had a time when they were somewhat interesting before. I don't know what the fuck they were doing to fuck it up like this.  SAO, Ares, The Breaker and maybe Which Hunter, there used to be a time when i thought the koreans might have some potential in the future. But then Webtoons came along. That format killed every ounce of talent they could have had.  And manhua will probably never get good for me. there is just something fundamentally different about the way they tell their stories.       Shouldn't this be in /co/?  Does baam get pushed before or after the time skip?    Everyone is still hoping that Baam will finally grow a spine and grow up but then he would have no major motivation to climb the tower.  And that's a major problem for SIU, he litetally wrote Baam in to be ultra dependent on Rachel.   That and SIU loves Rachel so there's no way he'd kill her off easy. Fuck man.         Both.    No, this isn't a hollywood super hero movie or show.    Both.     Both. The dumb fuck got pushed twice and from the looks of it he still hasn't learned his lesson.  Fuck you SIU        SIU loves Rachel  Seriously? Or is that just your conclusion based on how the story treats her?   That said, there's always the possibility SIU will flip-flop, and turn Rachel into an ally.        it ain't manga either    It would be unrealistic at this point to have Bam NOT be clingy to Rachel. His entire life up to that point revolved around one single person, and only on the occasion that she would visit him in that cave. So in between all of that dark shit loneliness, there was a light that would visit him once and a while.   So I think it's a natural response that not only is he clingy to her still, but he wants to know why she betrayed him. Plus without her he has little actual motivation to climb the tower at all.     I really liked Afterschool War Activities. I think it would make into a nice live TV series (a Korean one).   There's this one post from a mod you see every other manhwa thread. It basically asks the same question you ask, but the mod confirms that it's fine here. I'm sure someone will post it.    Its read left to right and colored, looks like /co/      Men can be dumb when they are clingy, I bet you'll do the same if you were dying and alone, and found yourself someone to connect with.     Doulou Dalu is best webcomic    After the ending of season one, he did a Q&amp;A on naver and when he was asked who his favorite character was he responded with Rachel.  He dislikes Koon the most because Koon is a smart character type and has to think hard for Koon's plans and dialogue .      Technically this is not a question aimed towards manwha alone, but all manga in general. Do you guys get huge autism and suddenly drop translated chapters if they only come in two pages online?  I have dropped decent series because of this. My autism goes to new levels when I try to read two paged manga online and make me stop reading.    NEX DID NOTHING WRONG    there are people who haven't read korean berserk yet  holy shit, how doesn't everyone know this series yet?     Its corean    Mods have said it goes in /a/ before, as it's Korean. Until a mod says otherwise, it does in /a/. We point this out nearly every thread.    I bet you'll do the same if you were dying and alone, and found yourself someone to connect with.  Doesn't mean we have to like a character just because his upbringing was shit.       korean webcomice have almost no standards for story or art.  i wish they weren't listed on MU. same with chinese novels. fuck them     I heard that the manhwa version made it too kid friendly because it was obviously aimed for them compared to the more adult novel version.  Go read the novel version       Obviously it's his favorite character, she's fucking dumb as fuck. Goes all edgelord and shit, and backstab her closest friend, why? Because she wants to fucking go watch motherfucking stars in the top. She can choke on those motherfucking stars all she wants, like holy fuck how stupid can you be, sometimes I think the author just wants to make her autistic. Like how can't you understand people relationships, and why the fuck do you then get jealous because Baam has more friends now.  Complete garbage. This pisses me off than watching NTR hentai.      Yes, I understand his in-character to be a clingy man. I loved Baam's monologue about Rachel too. It felt so strong compared to any mango I read.    wait they made a webcomic for that? shit, i've just been reading the raws, is it on batoto or am i gonna actually hunt for it?     I just wish they weren't so terribly colored, or shaded. Or whatever the fuck they call that art style     chinese novels  Fuck Wuxia/Xianxia, the whole genre is garbage.     Nah, shit pretending-to be-deep-edgy series.     Mods have said it goes in /a/ before  Nobody cares what /co/'s nigger mods have to say.     I've heard something similar. The Tofu guy in the webtoon actually had sausage powers in the novel, and the dick jokes were replaced by "bad smell" jokes.    I mean, I agree to a degree that her betraying him just to look at starts is stupid, but I think you're thinking about it in a pretty short sighted way. We don't know anything about her motivations yet at all.  You're making the assumption that she betrayed him for the most shallowest of reasons. I'm going to give SIU the benefit of the doubt and say that we don't yet know her real intentions.     Yeah, I'm up to date with the novel I just like how fun the manhwa is    Because /co/ a shit   I've stopped following ToG a few years ago. Baam is still gary stu as fuck?    Go look on mangacow for chapters up to 80 ish.  Mangacow gave up translating it and some other group is now.  Or you could read the translated novel chapters.         I remember one chapter when she was having her bullshit star dreams she only talks about, and only woke up because she saw Baam been taken over her new friends and got buttmad.  The fuck?      Just ignore those newfag. Just by lurking they will understand what is allowed and what is not.     gary stu as fuck?   He was just overleveled post-timeskip from all the grinding.      How in the fuck is Baam a gary stu? Guy had a horrible life and the one person that he likes keep trying to teach him as fly in the hard way.    I love manwha more than manga lately  Hngg Dice  mfw there will never be an anime        She's apparently scared of Baam. Or scared of the dark/night. Probably both, seeing how Baam's name means "night". And of course Rachel's name means "Light".     Do you enjoy the autistic female lead? I sure don't.  muh perfect school life   fucking dice        It's been butchered to be kid friendly.     Yeah. But you have to understand that the character he is given is meant to be a gary stu. Irregulars and what not. Like fucking onii-sama.  Ohh shit. I forgot about that. Okay, I'm still going to hope that theres more to it than just her getting all butt hurt over him have friends.  He's a total gary stu man. Almost everyone who meets him eventually likes him. SIU stopped killing characters and most people live and become part of the team now. Bams whole character literally revolves around being stronger than everyone else, it's what an irregular is meant to be. His latent ability is literally copying everyone elses moves and then doing it better.         forgot pic   The hatred towards Rachel will only intensify or lessen depending on the author. I remember every comment of the chapters i was reading, shitting on lizard girl, and now it's less since we got the backstory. That being said, it all depends on how the author wants to write her backstory. It's obvious that the author of Tower of God is just stalling because he doesn't know how to validate a bullshit reason like going watch stars as something strong enough to make her such a shit person.    He's loved or liked by everyone he comes around and has so many shit going on for him it's not funny. He's an irregular with OP ability to resist shinsoo and absorb all techniques, trained by FUG, has a Thorn and was able to scratch the strongest man in the Tower while being a complete newfriend. He also has a nice personality on top of it and whole harem of girl wanting his D including a princess of the tower. By the end of series he will unironically approach or surpass the level of madara uchiha copypasta. Tell me that he's not a gary stu.     You don't know what gary-stu mean.   I just want half of the cast to die. I'm not being edgy or anything, it's just that it's too much. SIU is being a pussy with every character he introduces and the cast will eventually become Nartuo tier where there are too many people, and not enough time to spend on each and every one of them.  He's making everyone join their damn team too. Just get rid of half of the new cast and throw out some of the old team too. It would make the chapters a little more exciting as well if there was some death.    what the fuck happened to madokami.  it still worked yesterday    His skill/ability is Gary Stuish. His life is a bit because suddenly those daughter of Zahhard loved him, those whatever stronk faction want to use him, only Rachel despises him.    <br/>    I was really expecting for Baam to destroy the train while he was falling again, but what? He fainted or something?     literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively  Which is actually surprising considering how many drastic changes the medium took over the last how many decades and how many authors thought whatever the were doing wasn't manga anymore. See A Drifting Life. The history of the term is actually way more complicated than anyone ever seems to think.   Traditionally made manhwa is a hell of a lot better than the cheaply done and mass produced webtoons they do these days. Which is actually a real damn shame. Webtoon format is pretty awful, and few use it well (and not enough close enough to not feel like it's completely for accomodating mobile devices and destroying any semblance of technique in panelling. Basically screw Tezuka.) They're not all completely awful, but they're probably more derivative than shitty shounen manga and the fact they didn't go through the same evolution or time span like manga speaks volumes for the quality. Where are their Otomo or Tezuka?        and was able to scratch the strongest man in the Tower  Wrong, he is the 4th. Baam scratching him or even surviving that hit was really retarded, but is just a case of shit writing.    Can Baam defeat Servants?    She wants to see the stars because she wants to be the main character of a fairy tale, just like that story she liked.  She she's legitimately scared of Baam because he's the one who opened the door to the tower and has the traits of an irregular.  Even headon said that she wasn't meant to be in the tower and only gave her a chance after making a deal with her.  Baam is a nuisance to her and she fears him.            shitting on lizard girl  People hated Anak before her backstory?   he doesn't know how to validate a bullshit reason like going watch stars as something strong enough to make her such a shit person.  It kinda seems like she WANTS him to climb the tower in these last couple chapters.    By the end of series he will unironically approach or surpass the level of madara uchiha copypasta  And then we'll have a new copypasta to shitpost.            To be honest its been about 2 years since I read ToG. You might be right.   Kamisama has hiccups all the damn time. Give it a day and itll probably be fixed.       Are we talking about Thorn-powered Baam who mastered the Supreme King's Scorching Fist of Death?    Nigga did you see how big that train was? I don't remember how long, but they've already been on the train for a couple of months and Rachels crew aren't even close to the front.    So upon meeting Baam constantly, Rachel is not scared of him?    How strong is that Supreme King's Scorching Fist of Death?   Hwa Ryun best girl.    Baam is essentially a mage that can copy your attack and use it better than you.  In addition to at least having a Saber class's strength and Rider's speed when he goes all out.  He's broken as fuck.         My nigga    Is Baam hypersonic?    This is almost word for word the current status of manga.    I hope you enjoyed their new announcement, although the bitches complaining might have overturned it somewhat. They were going to stop novels being added anymore and focus again on manga.    He has at least one movement technique that allows him to go fast.   Androssi best girl. Fuck that Rachel slut.     and use it better than you  Since when? The move he copies from Mazino (or however you spell that guy's name) I don't believe was even close to the same level. He still has to practice, even if only less.       She's scared of him but she knows that Baam doesn't have the balls to kill her.  She wants to be main character of her own story as she climbs the tower to see the stars, but every time she climbs up, a dark shadow called Baam reminds her that it isn't her story and that she is a fake.  Every time Baam meets her she is reminded that he is the chosen irregular and that she only got in becsuse she begged for a deal from headon.         No, it isn't, you're full of shit.     Androssi   not a slut  Hwa Ryun is the only true best girl.      How fast, exactly?    You're right, it's more akin to LNs.     Androssi   a slut  She's one of those virgins who pretend to be experienced, but doesn't know shit.  She'd be killed just for touching a dick.         SIU did call her the most beautiful girl in the cast and that beauty will play a large role in the future.      implying she will ever  She's probably to afraid of getting killed like the Gekko girl mother. She has to remain perma-virgin.   Wasted goods.       I've stopped following ToG a while ago, is her motivation at least somewhat clear now or she's still hiding everything about herself?    Too bad she's dead weight. She can't do anything other than look pretty and guide.   Baam will change the order in tower and impregnate everyone. Racher will be degraded into breeding sow.   I believe in him      To put in short terms, he can outrun people of his own level.  If you and Baam were of the same level, he could outrun you.  Nonetheless, there a bigger monsters than can instakill Baam if they wanted to.          I don't know.The one thing that's stopping me from getting into it is that the names sound too strange.  The nouns are all "syoong" "blook" "schlorp", it sounds like the frogpeople from fucking Rlyeh are trying to speak.        her class is guide   can't do anything but guide  anon.      She seems willing to break that rule for Baam, so I guess you just have to get her wet enough to not mind dying.   No, Hwa Ryun's motives are still completely unexplained, beyond the usual FUG "We want you to become our God".        She's still hiding her motives but it involves Baam doing something for her when he becomes powerful enough.  That and just teasing him/ being half serious when she calls him her God.       Answer the fucking question, you claimed that he was faster than Rider, back your claim.     She was skilled enough to handle some average regulars, but her main job is to be pretty and be a fucking guide.    WHERE THE FUCK IS THE NEW CHAPTER OF CAVALIER OF THE ABYSS?  If Baam can copy other people ability, is he kinda the same as medaka minus 20-30% of the abilites he didn't fully mastered    I'm only interested in the rape so there isn't much to discuss.      If Rider and Baam had the same rank speed (A+), Baam would be able to outrun Rider.  If rider used her mount, Baam would eat shit. He isn't that fast with his technique.       Not that anon, but Baam is a genius; if he sees someone use a technique for moving at super-sonic speeds, he can probably copy it on the fly. That's been his gimmick since "season 2".  That said, he can move fast enough to catch a ball at extremely high speeds. (Though he preferred to just freeze the ball in place)      /co/ is that way -------------------------&gt;   Girls d th wilds man. What a piece of shit. Dropped i think 4 chapters after MC kicked the bully's ass. After that i felt the creator had no idea the fuck he was doing.  My biggest gripe with ToG writing is these shitty games that are introduced every couple of chapters. There's always like a shit load of exposition and it's completely useless. That last game with the angry ball thing was pointless.  how mad were you during this moment    if he sees someone use a technique   technique  Yes, a technique, servants have hypersonic speed as base status, and a NP isn't a technique.         Even if he did copy it, he would be able to use as well as them  Granted, the fucker learns very fast, he would still need time to practice.       You mean mad at the last moment this shit was actually any good?   FUG is a pretty bad name. Does it stand for something? I forgot. How do you pronounce it? Like each letter separated, eff you gee? Or literally all together, fug.      that moment in second part when Rachel cuts the legs of runner guy    They are just finnish.     Aye, Rider is naturally fast because of her stats but so is Baam.  Baam in one of the most recent chapters jumped several thousand feet in seconds to put things into perspective.  In a fight without noble phantasm, Baam has the bigger chance of winning, but rider uses her NP's he's done for.         Dude this series is so sad. The ending was shit.    All we know is from her own words. FUG hold a grudge against the families, Zahard and those who envy their possessions which is why they want to change the tower. A Slayer of FUG is someone who is intended to kill Zahard and regarded as a God by the Organization. And Hwa Ryun regarded Baam (A Slayer) as HER God.   Her point is being a highly important plot piece. Evan was in utter shock seeing her and it's confirmed those two don't even know each other.  She's subject of countless theories cause it's been made clear something is up with her like people thinking she's Headon.               It's should be /a/ because Manhua and Manhwa is literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively   That's not a reason. Manga is literally just Japanese comics. "Japanese comics except Chinese" are not Japanese comics.      Wouldn't you count the Thorn as a Noble Phantasm in this scenario though? Wasn't that what even allowed him to jump that height?   No seriously, why do Manhwa names sound like frog people trying to speak?   Can Baam kill Gil? Wouldn't Baam get fucked?     I was pissed as fuck. I'm glad he's able to run again but SIU is being too nice to his characters.     Because its corean    Nope.Though it's probably a shortcut. The founder is called Grace.      Seoung Gyool Bloop and whatnot.     It's Finland. Who the fuck knows.       I didn't consider it a NP because it is becoming a part of him rather than a weapon.  But if we consider the thorn an NP, he's fucked.       As he is now, he will. But when he climbs all the way to the top and becomes Phantaminum-tier in power who is able to bend rules of reality around him? Gil will get fucked really hard even if he pulls out all his top tier shit, it's like comparing Gil and Aristoteles.     https://www.tumblr.com http://www.deviantart.com      Not a fucking chance. Baam would die due to GoB spam.  The only way he would survive is he could spam magic bolts(shinsu blasts) fast enough to match Gil.  He doesn't have enough bangs for that.  He would needs hundreds of bangs for that.          <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111543  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111773  For a few minutes there I thought you were dead    I'm pretty proud of this thread, no one responded to the bait the shitposter keeps on posting.  Good job guys, now if only a janitor or mod could come here and clean up.     Gook here. It's because most of the common vowels don't have a 1:1 correspondence with English vowels and consonants, so you get really awkward clusters like eo, ae, eu, kk, gk, and so forth which would confuse the fuck out of foreigners, even though they're actually quite simple to pronounce once you know how it's supposed to sound.  On the otherhand, Japanese phonology is far more simple, and so are their vowels, which romanize neatly for the most part (ex. sushi).  tl;dr The latin alphabet is just a piss-poor tool to represent common Korean vowels.        SIU will have his hand fall off before he finishes this damn series. He says ToG is just the start, and he wants several other series to be in the same world all culminating together or some shit after this.  He's already gone to the hospital or something because he has wrist problems. It's taken him how many years already to get this far in ToG?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111773   or /b/  I get that you're technically correct, but no one's going to take any sort of discussion topic to /b/. /co/ ought to be where this belongs - if the mods there actually have banned it, then people interested in it should lodge a complaint and see if anything happens, because it clearly isn't /a/ material.     Baam will never become Phantaminum-tier, author already said that Red Tower possible won't even appear because he is too broken. Phantaminum is much above him and just not beatable, by anyone showed so far, thanks to his race/status.    You weren't wrong.    Who is phantaminum again? Wasn't he only mentioned once in the whole story thus far?     We've discussed this before, mods allowed Korean manhwa, true enough these are Korean webtoons, or online korean comics.  We need a moderator to finally put the issue at rest as to whether Korean webtoons are permissible here.  Someone summon a mod in here to finish this once and for all.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127111773   people have always talked about korean manhwa here before. you newfags really need to stop trying so hard.  even i can admit that they're pretty damn shit these days. but then just call them shit if they're shit. nobody needs these meme posts.       Rank 1, guy that raided Zahard's palace or something like that, killed almost everyone there and they didn't even manage to scratch him.    Is there any correlation between being an irregular and becoming an Axis? Baam is always insanely broken compared to the people on the same floor as he is, hell he was able to survive an attack from a guy who is only a few ranks lower than Phantaminum. I won't be surprised if he becomes an Axis user himself at the end of series, and it's even more broken than Aristoteles.      Whether or not the mods says it's ok, won't stop people from shitting on it. People spent years dubspamming Naruto and they only let up because of N/a/ruto and the eventual demise of the series (although I don't know how well that reflects the current situation with the new series).   And people have shit on them since forever. People used to like Shin Angyo Onshi, The Breaker (the original) and Veritas, but the anti-TOG brigades were excellent back in their day.      Is anyone reading Magician? Is it worth picking up or it's dragged for too long? I've heard it was running on snail's pace for ages.     He's the god of the story, and he decides who lives and who dies. No can match him, not even irregulars.  He is the author writing the story of ToG basically.  And there are stronger gods than him, each gods of their own worlds/universes.         Not really, Zahard, Red Tower and Mazino are all irregulars and they aren't Axis.   ToG was really good until it became about friendship. Part 1 was amazing.   No. 1 in the Ranking. He utterly decimated everyone who came into his way including the most elite Rankers and Zahards strongest men which started the irregular stereotype. It's confirmed he's an Axis with the power to influence and manipulate the plot itself. According to SIU, he came from outside the tower where many Axis exist as Tower of God is just a part of the Talse Uzer Universe.       It always was about friendship and betrayal. Author just doesn't like to kill his characters and that is kinda bad for a manhwa like this, but there were excellent bits in second part like Rachel cutting the sanic guy so he will never be able to go fast again.     we might as well allow shit like avatar, wakfu, and rwby here too  fuck off       He got soft is what happened, people actually died in Season 1 as to season 2 where only the major bad guy died.     Part 1 was much darker than the later bits. I mentally gave up when he befriended Beta and stopped reading just before they got on the train. It went from a fairly gritty seinen to a serialized shounen in tone. Retarded.    Nah.Phantaminum was just the first irregular who's actions are why irregulars are received the way they are. Not all are Axis, he just gave them a bad rep by storming into the Tower and obliterating everything in his path.      just before they got on the train  Last time I checked, they hadn't done that yet.    Damn, I felt it when she told her that.   Daft Punk died.    Oh. Well, there you go. The last chapter I read was where Baam was going on a date with one of the princess girls.    oh god, that bitch nr 2 on my most hated /a/ related character list    Who do you think Baam will end up with?  The guide, Androssi, Pink flames, Black March, Yuri?    The author should've made rachel look better, if she's going to be a bitch at least make her look good.   He probably doesn't know that, because he dropped it. That arc took forever, only for no one to get on except useless people.     Who's the first one?     black march   implying black march is even remotely relevant  Black March is dead. Last time we saw her was in the first fucking chapter. The only way she will be relevant again is if he is given her again, and she is used as a plot device to control the power of the Thorn.      If Zahard can have lots of family spinoffs, why can't Baam have lots of waifus.     All of the Above  It's just that kind of story.     but we don't, you shitter. because they're not anime/manga related. manhwa/manhua on the other hand is manga related. don't restrict /a/'s manga taste with your shitty memes. or go back to watching anime.  you can argue about webtoons, but not manhwa.       best girl is obviously koon's nee-sama that he likes    None.    mozgus from berserk. and nr 3 is mari from prison school list has only three members so far.       Even now I pray that Baam gets Black March again.  Yuri and Baam are destined by plot to meet in train again so that is only chance we'll get.   Pray.          manhwa/manhua on the other hand is manga related  Bullshit, the relation is no different than comics made in any country.      because they're not anime/manga related  neither is manhwa      NTRing himself  Holy shit, I just remembered. Koon is such a retard.  Also  Korean   nee-sama          SIU will rev up the dark story train and fire girl, guide, and black march will all probably die somehow.  Leaving Androssi and Yuri. Yuri will probably die somehow saving Bam, saying how she believes that he can make a real change in the tower. Androssi is the clear winner here, she was a lot stronger than him originally but because he caught up to her level they're around the same tier. It just makes sense for her to live to the end. That being said, I hate her.        no Rachel option  She's more likely than half of those, since it's pretty much Yuri vs. Androssi. Androssi has the advantage of actually hanging around him, but the fact that Yuri is even a character despite being disconnected from the main narrative means she's got something in store.    It'll probably be inconclusive.        Androssi is a permavirgin unless Zahards are overthrown. Pink flames is kinda useless and bland. Hwa Ryun is best-looking, a guide which is very rare for a tower, and worships Baam as her personal god. She's obviously the best girl.      indeed. I hope we see more of that again though, I want koon to try to get her back or something or at least have them interact.  also, chocolate guy will use blue-haired idol as a sacrifice to bring back the guy he wants to revive, right?        I don't think they'll die because Baam is crazy obsessed about the safety of his team and of catching Rachel.  They'll become devoted members of the harem.       Kill yourself.    I don't see this as having a harem end. Then again seeing the way the story is being written now, it's probably a pretty big possibility.   Koreans Koreans everywhere   But I'm black, nigga    First, I don't get why you'd reply to those posts - it just detracts from the thread.  Second, manhwa/manhua aren't manga. This is a fact. Their allowance isn't because they're automatically included in the topic of manga - it's because of a mod fiat, just like DJT.    Mozgus   Mari  How? Mozgus is a dick, for sure, but not exceptional in the big scheme of things, and Mari's mildly annoying at worst.          I hope Ryun wins, she has been getting closer to Baam as of late and is an important character for the later plot.    non-japanese anime and manga  Independent of anything else, that phrase should be banned.      liking shit that happens to be made by Koreans makes you Korean  Is this just your weaboo delusions about wanting to be Japanese seeping through?      How?  Any question that can be answered with "different people like/dislike different hings" isn't a questions worth asked. But, if you must know, I find self-righteousness utterly appalling and disgusting. Which is why I dislike Mozgus more than Griffith or Wylad, for instance. As for mari, she's self-righteous too and, no, I wouldn't call her thinking style and actions , especially during the first arc, "mildly" annoying.       Alright I don't give a shit whether gooks or nips make a comic, they're all yeller monkeys to me.  But god damn are Koreans unable to carry a fucking manhwa, Tower of God? Noblesse? The Breaker? Veritas?  What the fuck are you doing gooks? They either turn to shit or just get outright canceled. Meanwhile that freezing author dude has a million series going at once and they all feature the exact same characters and all suck.  Yeah nah until they learn to fucking write a story I'm out of their shit.         No one asked you to be here anon.    thanks anon    annyeonghaseyo    shut your whore mouth, lim-dall is the hero we deserve.    Don't kid yourself, he is completely right.     Any question that can be answered with "different people like/dislike different hings" isn't a questions worth asked.    Why do you like this show?   Because different people like different things.   Come on, now, anon.          urek mazino   one of the strongest in the tower   dresses like a 16 year old faggot  Seriously man, snap back and he ties a hoodie around his waste? What the fuck man.       Koreans have terrible fashion sense.    Well, I did answer, didn't I?    implying if you could do whatever you want, you wouldn't revert to your chuuni teen self         implying I'd even wear clothes if I could do whatever I wanted     I... Probably. But probably more this     okay, so your chuuni 2 year old self then? Maybe mazino just isn't that strong, I bet nr1 walks around with his dick out.     As far as I've seen from their mainstream culture, those guys are pretty damn fashionable. I think ISU is just weird.  I'd just go around naked, to be completely honest.      He was just chilling and having fun. This guy is god knows how old and probably a little weird at this point.   Would it kill to grow two braincells and start a manhwa thread without explicitly calling it a manhwa thread?   this nigga knows       if /a/nons could do whatever they wanted, they'd be a naked slut  Why am I not surprised in the slightest?       Have you ever walked around naked before? It's fucking great. The wind blowing on your nether regions is a feeling you don't feel too often.  Granted you'd have to be camping or somewhere no one can see you.     No, it's cold as fuck here year-round and I would freeze to death within the hour.    Who ever said anything about being a slut? I'd just be a chronic masturbator god.   No impure slutting around.       I wouldn't even be a slut. I'm nude in my apartment most of the time, anyway. I'd just not have to get dressed to go out.    Where do you live?    In your bed.    What chapter is this?    What the fuck is this black demon king shit? This never happened in the novel.    I have lice, bed bugs, cockroaches and mice all living in my apartment. Would you still want to live in my bed?    Yeah uh, Urek answers to basically no one and maintains the "king of the street" mentality within the tower. He dresses like a thug grifter because he basically is. He does what he wants, goes where he pleases and fucks with whoever he thinks will end up as a good time. He's a good character like that though, because he's more or less uncorrupted by his own retarded power level by maintaining a childish attitude.   Popularity grew before skills.  As in pacing and art.  Least he updates more than Ava's Demon kek        Talse Uzer Universe   I know SIU's trying to expand the world and whatnot, but with a story this long, it never works. I've read the other works he did before it was removed and it has nothing to do with TOG. It's not looking good for SIU at the moment.      I think a big problem is, siu -or other similar tier artists- didn't expect to get popular. that has two effects. they don't want the fun they're having doing a successful story to end and they don't want the popularity/income of doing a successful story to end. so they drag it. and drag it. and we barely reached rachel again, nope, she escaped, oh well, next time , nope, she escaped, well now you get to her , so wipe her out, no, I'll just talk to her, nope she's a bitch and escaped again.      What the fuck is this gook shit? Read the fucking rules, gooks  a/ - Anime &amp; Manga 1. All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga.      Holy shit, even deviantart shit look much better than this    258 posts   61 poster  Fucking shameless gook, i swear     A lot of things happen in the manhua that never happened in the novel or was different, if you want to look through it just bear in mind that it's almost a completely different story, just a similar setting.     Can't See Can't Hear was pretty good.     we just had this same gook thread yesterday   OP is probably the same degenerate gook   with a bunch of koreaboo samefags  What the fuck is wrong with /a/ nowadays? this is even worse than /v/      Doulou Dalu 2 is actually better, but we don't have anyone translating it to english yet. Maybe when the group that's doing 1 is finish with it.     I rarely see discussions about Manwha, so I decided to make a little thread it  What is this? /b/?      mfw people actually read trash like this  How can you still alive?    A classic, a masterpiece and a embodiment   Is this an actual manwha? Not from deviantart or some godforsaken place?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127114163   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113090    Please read <br/>          It's always that one guy, that guy that had his parents raped by koreans.  I know it's you man, no one hates these threads more than.  How I pity you, you poor soul.         Of course, just like the beautiful art from OP pic. So indie it hurt   best gook shit    /q/ is dead  And the rule is still here. Can you tell me why /q/ is dead?     I can't think of how many times I've seen this. I just realized that his hands is not going into his pockets, he's straight up warming up his nuts.    Why does he not use his pockets? What are pockets for?   <br/>   Anon, they're all the same person. All this shitposting and the number of posters doesn't even increase? Yeah.    I think moot said something about how it wasn't used properly by anons so he replaced it with the "Feedback" feature.    Are you high or something? i just want to post it so people can enjoy this work of art      And the rule is still here, and this is the first thing in the rule  All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga.  I'm waitting      Yea I shouldn't have bothered, there's a image right there with a mod saying that Manhua / Manhwa belongs here in /a/ and still the shitposting continues    I mean, this is pretty shitty. But it doesn't match mr. fuck pockets. I want more of that guy.    https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>iq3QDoj5Moy_oi4NxvQ-QA/</wbr>      dat shitty design  Even trashcolle has better design than this       It's him, and only him. I keep telling people that his parents were raped by Koreans.  He always appears and never stops singing the same same song.   The same posts by himself, a lonely man.          the image in a dead board   but the rule is still there  Why are gookboo so retard?      Mail not-moot about it faggot. Between a mod and some random fuck who deliberately seeks out manhwa threads to ask the same thing over and over, I'll listen to a mod.    ;^)   mods sleeping?     To add to my post, look at my picture and read the guy's filename.  It's him, the poor soul.        i-it the same image m-must be that one guy      mod   a random leddit  Google Rapeape, newfag      The ending ruined the whole series.  As expected from the gooks, they are lacking in imagination.       Man, this is a pretty special level of sad.      I'd hug you if I could, you poor thing.  I don't know what the Koreans did to you but you are among friends.  Calm yourself and stop shitposting         It's sad, isn't?     that mod is rape ape   Do you have a single fact to back that up?      mods just remove a few post that says &gt;&gt;/co/ so they seem to be doing their job     2015   sucking mods cocks  Why don't you just go suck some donkey dicks then? it's the same      Janitors probably.    Aren't you the one screaming "RULES SAY ONLY ANIME AND MANGA LOOK AT THE RULES" ? Who's the one sucking mod cock here? Or what, do you think those rules weren't made by mods? Were they sent to us on tablets by the god of 4chan?    From your favorite dead board http://4chandata.org/q/Rapeape-we-n<wbr>eed-you-a592612</wbr>      He's been doing this for at least year now.  He just appear and does this until he tires of it or the thread is deleted.  I was mad at him at first but then I seriously felt bad for the guy.         What does your link have to do with anything?  I asked if you have a single fact to prove that RapeApe allowed manhwa while every other mod does not?       mods =/= moot  Are you really that dumb? so we post avatar and simpson here? it's drawn by corean too      felt bad for the guy.   stoop down to his level calling his parents raped by gook and interacting with him  Yeah, thanks for enabling him     There are 2 manhwa that I like, Shin Angyo Onshi and Kangho.  Everything else is just so shit, it's not even funny. Guess that's what happen when you have an entire generation grew up watching shitty drama, half of which involves cheating partners.     Where is moot right now? Oh wait.   Go mail him about it and tell me what his response is.      huh? i just want to say that the fag you listen to is a leddit faggo. is it that hard to understand?   If only most of the art wasn't so bad.   And I'm asking you to prove to me that the guy in that screen rape ape.     mods is dead   moot is dead  And the rule is still here  All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga.  Tell me what chink and gook shit has anything to do with anime &amp; manga?       Post Gary Stus.   is*    And i'm asking you to prove the rule is wrong, can you tell me why mods and moot deleted /q/?    Please kill yourself.    Why? what chink and gook shit has anything to do with anime &amp; manga? Answer me, gook    Are you autistic? Is this endless 8?   I already told you , you raging faggot I've had enough of this brainless conversation.      best Manwha. Too bad it ended.  more than half the thread's been about whining about gooks. Go bump threads about something not gook if you guys don't want to see gook thread    Meanwhile in /a/cademy city   Don't run.   Just let it happen.          I have this classmate she's level 5 and is very good at sports, I think I've fallen for her. How can I get myself to date her?     I'm a level 0 btw       Saten, get the fuck off the internet. If Kuroko finds out about this then you're fucked.  Also stop using the Judgment wi-fi. You're slowing down my torrents.      Ugh, stop arguing or I'll short out your devices.    Life here is kind of rough when your a stage magician. I mean you got children who can do incredible things with there ability. All I can do is separate two rings that are connected to each other  Previously on Academy City....  Accelerator began to bang Last Order. But could do it since she kept say "Misaka Misaka hurts. Misaka Misaka hurts!" Then the darkness of a alleyway, Kamijo tries to stick it into Mikoto Misaka but can't get get it hard due to touching it with his Imagine Breaker. Kuroko rushes in from the dark to strike him down with a trash can.      Man. How long has it been since any update on that anime?   I swear its been like years, if I remember anything past the miserable collection of other moeblob ecchi shit I've had to repress in my head.  Are the producers just not caring anymore?        Stop posting your bullshit online, there will be hell to pay if they see this.    Sauce?    How do you call "controlling water with your mind"?  I need a dude like that to paint my room.      Literally any telekinetic worth shit can control stuff like water, I wouldnt use it to paint a room though, it basically never comes out even    well, i have this unlucky high school level 0 friend but somehow alot of girls seem attracted to him.  I heard he has alot of real magician friends. you should ask him      Real Magicians     Has anyone tried to poison this faggot yet?    You'd have to go around poisoning the coffee in every vending machine, there'd be too much collateral damage. (I'm pretty sure he has never been mentioned eating in the novels, only ever drinking canned coffee)    Telekinesis = Moving with mind Hydrokinesis = Moving water with mind    So...does anyone know where I can find a link to that level upper or... Google isn't giving me any results.   Raid the Windowless building with me.  Some middleschool cunt shorted out my new PFP.  Fucking high levels I swear. You think I can get a refund?   Woke up and found a bunch of stickers with weird letters stuck on the walls outside my apartment. It wasn't Japanese either.   Not just my room too, everyone on my floor had the same thing.  What is going on        Acdemy shitty sucks  This spiky haired faggot punched me out of nowhere because i push some cosplaying nun, because i got irratated.      Dat terminator reference    Where's that Styil guy who yells out for kanzaki?  I'm Aihana Etsu.   That shitty tower blocks my view.     Sure thing bro, I got a couple jackhammers we can use.  We all know that Moot hasn't left us and is just hiding inside that damn building.       Yeah? And I'm Misaka Mikoto, AMA.    who?   Just yesterday, in Seventh Mist, I saw a blond-haired man getting chased by a girl in a tracksuit. Is Academy City this strange?  I was hanging out at a cafe the other day in District 7 when suddenly this fag shows up and starts attacking this girl with a flower headband. He kicked her and dislocated her shoulder and was about to curb stomp her when another guy with white hair showed up by throwing an ATM at her before I got out of there.  How often does this shit happen in D7? I wanted to help her but I'm just a level 1 and my power sucks.   Flower girl if you are reading this I'm sorry that I couldn't do anything       The Roman Catholic Church did nothing wrong. Except Biagio. Biagio did everything wrong.   Time to take out life insurance.   When the fuck are they going to flood the streets again? I missed it this year because I was stuck in the hospital.   I'm hungry   Next year my school gonna win Daihaseisai for sure!   Overaged poster detected.     Pizza    <br/>  How do I get strong /a/? I'm sick of being a shitty level 0.   What? Someone hurt Uiharu?!  That bastard... I'm going to destroy him!     So, are they just going to let the Anglican church slide after what they did to Index with the whole memory wiping/manipulating her?    Call it a Rank 0   Actually outranks angels  Why is this allowed?      Poor Man's Index    Level upper  Some anon before asked the link for it. Does anybody knows?      It's okay, I forgive you. I'm also level 1. If I have more power then I could defend myself. Thank you for your consideration.    Can we meet IRL?      I'am Kihara   Fuck off impostor, a real Kihara wouldn't declare himself a Kihara   ˙uoᴉʇɐsɹǝʌuoɔ ǝɥʇ ƃuᴉʎoɾuǝ ʇsnɾ ɯ,I 'ǝɯ puᴉɯ ʇ,uop   Normally, but for some reason Kamachi uses terms like Elektromaster and Hydrohand.    Since when were australians able to post here?    Since we shitposted Aleister to death.   Guys, on September 30th you're also collapsed for no reason right? It's not just me right?  I'm a level 2, how much can I even do with my ability?    Dunno, probably sleepin there.     get power to time travel, nut can't touch anything   You can train your power and get stronger!   Since we failed last time can we finally group up on that annoying spiky haired dude?  How would power levels work in /a/cademy city, would seeing how much anime and manga you've read and watched be an indication of your strength?   Dude, he's friends with one of the level 5. I've also heard, he basically never lost a fight, no matter howmany he fought. No way I'll fight him.    Power = GUTS!    All of my yes! That dude punched me just because I helped some middle schoolers up! He spouted things like 'Taking her as your prey' what the hell dude!    You're that weird guy with white headband aren't you?   I am Aihana Etsu!   He's just a level 0 so I've heard, what can go wrong?    Nope. Just an ordinary level 0 who saw that guy use that awesome ability. Super Amazing Punch!    Ah, sorry. I thought you're him   does he even know how to use computer?       I recommend you don't fight that idiot. I know him, and he's one of the most powerful people in all of academy city. He can stop Level 5 abilities, like mine.    Woah really?     level 5  Are you trying to doxx yourself?     ...Whoops.    What, has there been an update of S3 for Index?   I heard Tree Diagram was broken. Is this rumor true? How could this happen?  Where my level 3 bros at?   Aleister wont allow his dead.   MISAKA A SHIT A SHIIIIIIIT    W-WHAT?! Why, I oughta...    File a complaint for bullying?   You could say that it *drumroll* has been uprooted.        *action*     B-baka.    I saw him once use a computer via repeatedly punching it with GUTS. I have absolutely no idea why that worked for him.    No, my friend has it covered. She can get in all sorts of places...   If only she wasn't trying to get inside of me!       I don't remember that scene from Fate.   THE SPIKEY HAIRED BOY FINALLY TALKED TO ME   Really? Tell us! Tell us! What did he said to you?!   Guys, I saw this cool guy with a white headband, how can I be as cool as him?  Guys what if we pretend were an imageboard in an anime universe.    Guys what if we pretend were an imageboard in an anime universe: the thread   Ftfy      2025   Not being at least Level 3   Level 4 here, and I seriously pity the lot of you. Researchers are coming to me every other week, asking me if I can aid in their experiments and whatnot. Not only do I feel my powers develop, I get paid handsomely for it as well. A couple years ago I used to be Level 3, but just a few months ago, I was finally reclassified to Level 4 from how much my esper powers grew. If scientists aren't coming to you because you have a common ability, fret not, since there's always volunteer programs you can sign up for, and no matter how common, even a level 1 electromaster can make serious gains if they know where to look.       Meanwhile on duw/a/ng    did anyone else see that giant white beetle ?   Yes. Freaky   Anybody selling dream cards with hot dreams about Misaka? I got some femdom accel ones if anybody wants to trade    Misaka <br/>   Ghost is dead   obviously a typo, I meant Misaki   Ghost is dead  What do you think of her?  Annoying and unlikable in her own route. Plays the role of a helpless damsel throughout most of it only to turn into the main villain by the end, yet we're supposed to like and want to save her regardless.  The most I'd do is a peck of the cheek if she grabs me I'm making a run for it though    Worms slut.    Sexiest Fate girl.  Best waifu as well.    complete doormat  PMS the character  Managed to drag down everything good in HF with her shittiness.   Best girl.   Illya is close second though.        Is she really full of worms or its just figurative? I saw F / Z, but compared to her Uncle, she appears to be quite healthy     She is literally full of worms.     She needs to calm the fuck down.     She is just misunderstood. I bet every anon in here would date a 3DPD that would resemble Sakura in looks and personality and you faggots can't deny it.     I bet every anon in here would date a 3DPD     It's just a meme, she has only one worm left in her  heart.     Fuck haters, she is pretty nice. And her Servant is the best girl.     A shit. A big stinky shit.  Seiba is the best girl. Fate is the best route.      Sakura made one mistake, and that was underestimate Shirou's resolve to save her by going back to her house, when she killed Shinji. Even at the end (ruru bureika), she believed Shirou was going to kill her, but fuck that, he said he was going to save her and he did it.    Urobutcher please.     tfw no information on HF in TMAce    "The magazine will give more details on the upcoming mobile app game Fate/Grand Order, bundle with a Fate Cross Over Drama CD, an illustration by Wada Aruko (Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC), and a Blue Saber rubber strap."        Fate is the best route.      seiba best girl   fate best route      reading the VN   pretty goo till now   never understood the "bone of my sword" and "body of swords" thing   reading HF yesterday   almost done it seems   they show Shirou's body   Holy fuck I thought this was only some sort of exaggeration or something else. I'm at work right now, I stopped reading yesterday after using fucking Rule Breaker on Sakura. Fucking Rule Breaker man, how did fucking Shirou figure that out.          I HATE IT.    Best girl in every route.     stopping right in the middle of final climax   literally 1/2 (goat) scenes away from ending  For what purpose.     Worst girl with the worst servant literal the shitest combination there is     Worst girl with best girl  Ftfy.     I have no idea how you have managed to go this long without being spoiled, but you should probably finish the VN before coming back to this thread.    Only good heroine tbh.    Best fighter in Fate/Unlimited Codes    It was 2am bro. I had work.   Okay, will avoid /a/ until I finish it.        waifu   you must like getting cucked by cartoon characters, kill yourself m8.       cucked   Implying a girl that waited for her loved one until the day she died of old age would ever cuck you  Senpai pls      It's a meme. In the end she only has one worm left in her and it's not where you think it is.   Of course, I wouldn't be surprised if the people who only started using this term recently don't even know that.       annoying in F/uc   annoying in CFF       fate best route   Are we supposed to take you seriously?     I've grown to like her. Not my favorite TM girl, but I don't think she deserves the hate she gets.  Ufotable managed to make her look the best out of the three heroines.   This I do agree with.     She always looked the best though.     Dat everything 10/10     I wonder if Sakura would look better if she kept her old black hair/blue eyes combo.   We could have had all this moe but shit happened  YAY Penis shaped worms everywhere!   Who is that?   ZR vs Tights   <br/>    Tights is what we call them in Britain. Americans call them Pantyhose.      tearing them for an access  That seems so brutish. There are crotchless ones. Or something like this as compromise.     She is a cock tinker.     Time for a WEG thread.  Post WEGs.     Jesus, I just got hungry literally right after I stopped eating because I was totally full.    Ergo Proxy is not for kids    This is literally perfect.    Huh? What does Lucky Star have to do with Haruhi other than the protagonist liking the anime?     /a/ Thoughts on Overlord?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuN<wbr>APPcjDr4</wbr>  [ ]    I fucking love it and I am excited for the anime, a shame they will ruin it somehow. In other news, I am hoping for more translations this weekend.  Pretty obvious, isn't it? Was never a fan of time traveling shenanigans but I might put up with it       Lizardbros  getting "it on"  happens in 5th chapter, just before it's time for them to share the fate of Swords of Darkness.    Better get used to it, it's summer time. I know last summer's wait for few LN's got painful as damn. At least we have the anime to use as painkiller.     The whole LN concept where this "normal" guy uses his "gaming smarts" to just completely bowl over some game world is just retarded.   While you bring up a good point, Overlord isn't like that. The MC is kinda OP, but not because of any outstanding personal quality or "gaming smarts". Not that it matters, because the MC being OP doesn't help him with the conflicts the show brings up.      what's this from? google gives me fairy tail     Precure thread    Hip Attack aka Oshiri Panchi!   Leather pants or maybe Wolfrun just has a really nice ass.   Manslaughter  Eye Beams  プリキュア春のさくらんぼカーニバル hashtag for cherry themed pictures   Who's more fluffier Uzuki or Kaede?    Space     CD SINGLE WHEN, SCAMO?     The City of Arisufags.   I'm sorry, I couldn't here you over how high up the Cinderella Girl throne is and the fact that Syuko is starring in a CD Drama and 2 group songs.  Love, A Syukofag.           a loli   expecting anything anymore       reminder that Syuko needed help from the higher ups to win a rigged contest, and Arisu beat her fair and square in 2014.    Stupid Boruto, I'm going to be the next Hokage    Typical rebellious youth. A lot of people are like that at that age.   Why does that big fucker have a horn growing out of his head?  tbh i would have used a tripcode at least once but i never bothered to look up how, and by the time i thought of doing it it was too late anyway   He's just being difficult, like Naruto would have been if he had an actual family. Give the kid time, hopefully he'll make up for it.     Watch the trailer again. He is just exactly like any tsundere ever </blockquote>]
