Is there anybody who unironically uses Windows 8 on a non-tablet?  Would Cortana be her spunky sidekick? Or the wise-cracking onee-san? The flirty senpai?  <br>Attracting neckbeards audience.</br>  <br>I have 8.1, it's not horrible.</br>  <br>8.1<br>yes<br>since 2013</br></br></br>  <br>After buying a nexus 9 I immediately regretted it, playing VNs on your tablet seems awesome.<br><br>Too bad android is stuck with some shitty kirikiroid emulator or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br>neither should an application framework</br>  I'm honestly looking forward to the release of windows 10, so I finally have a good reason to clean my pc of all the garbage and/or install gentoo  <br><br>I just don't get why you'd do that to yourself, it's annoying as hell with the homescreen and weird search functions. I can deal with it if it's for the sake of using a surface pro, but do guys just enjoy torturing yourselves or something, or is there some feature I'm not aware of that makes it worth it?</br></br>  <br> implying I'm using even one of them </br>  <br>The homescreen is bad and I don't use it and the search function needs work. I'm waiting for Win 10 and will download it after the initial problems are resolved.</br>  <br>It's not like there is much of a choice, I'm clueless about GNU/Loomix (I've tried to install Mint on an old PC but couldn't set up dual boot) and going back to 7 is a step back</br>  <br>Yes voting should be over now.<br>http://dspwindows-10charanaming.azu<wbr>rewebsites.net/interimreport.aspx<br><br>Sora was the winner</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>You shouldn't be looking forward to the release of windows 10.<br>If anything, you should be looking forward to some unspecific date a few months after the release of windows 10 when the major bugs have been dealt with and you can look up the internet if you should switch to w10 or not.</br></br>  Are any of these OS-tans actually official characters created by the OS's company?  <br> going back to 7 is a step back <br>This isn't a bad thing, progress is a social construct :^)</br></br>  <br>That can't be official.</br>  <br>see<br><br>They're all official MS girls.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't use Linux for games. Notice how every time someone says that they say </br>  <br>Notice how every time this thread comes up it's still not anime related? If you're going to play traffic cop at least do it properly.</br>  <br> watching anime </br>  <br>I let her store my seed in her cloud if you know what I mean<br><br><br>I did since october 2013</br></br></br></br>  <br>I do as well.

If you grab the latest ISO it will automatically detect any already installed systems and allow you to boot side by side.</br></br>  <br>I think a couple of years ago, Mint 14 if I recall correctly.</br>    <br>I knew Sora would be the winner every single person from /g/ voted for it including myself.</br>    <br>I do since last 2012. Probably will change start menu to start screen since I like start screen more than start menu.</br>  <br> Buy a Mac. </br>  <br>Trust me, she's got aids and shit.</br>  <br>Only if Cortana's her rival.</br>  <br><br>Windows 10-tan is just Windows 8-tan with a boobjob.</br></br>  <br><br> microsoft Bob-tan is retarded and has to be taken care of by the other windows-tan. </br></br>  <br> My OS is important too. 12 people use it <br>Billions of people use Linux since Linux powers the modern web. I'd say that makes it pretty important.</br></br>  <br><br>The windows logo in the upper left corner, duh.<br><br><br><br>APACHE doesn't count retard. Apache-tan would be a hamster or something that pops out of the other tans' heads when they get overloaded and scampers off, like Java-tan is a naughty pervert eel that is constantly trying to peep on the sexy tans only to end up causing more mayhem than it intended.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want Win10-tan to bust my balls and force me to masturbate to loli in cam for the feds.  <br>Anyone? She's an integral part of the 10-tan story.</br>  <br><br>Probably the sidekick. The overly helpful (see clippy) yes-woman that's always there. If Sora were a delinquent, Cortana would be her crony.</br></br>  <br>Robo-maid 10-tan built to do menial chores around the house</br>  <br> APACHE doesn't count retard. <br>Since when was anyone talking about Apache?</br></br>  <br>how can they decide on a tan now - it's not even out yet</br>  <br>how can you decide on the name of the baby now - he's not even born yet<br><br> Why do I have to select cars if it's asking me to pick wagons? </br></br></br>  <br><br> daily reminder win 10-tan will send your files to microsoft and give you up to fbi for loli shit and having pirated animu!Who cares if they scan your files and send it to the government cause it is free right guys! </br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that 10-tan looks at your pictures and will call the party van free of charge if she findes any lolies.</br>  <br><br>They never cared :^)</br></br>  windows 10-tan on desktop waifu when?  <br>no one said there efficient and fast anon</br>  <br>She is just building a case against you anon, 10-tan will hit you so hard you will go into orbit when she's ready.</br>  Friendly reminder that windows 10 has photodna built into it's kernel and will be scanning all your pics and sending the hashes to microsoft.  <br>Tfw she findes your loli collection.</br>  <br> sending the hashes to microsoft. <br>Why should I care if it sends only the hashes of my files?<br><br>Why would anyone want the hashes of my files to begin with?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Loli is legal in my country so I couldn't care less if Microsoft employees want to masturbate to my collection.</br></br>  Does someone have the windows xp on her deathbed pic  <br>Because microsoft cooperates with law enforcement in your country.<br>I hope you don't live in canada or britcuckistan, where drawings are illegal.</br></br>  Choose only one  <br> Not knowing how hashing identification works. </br>  <br>Nanami</br>  <br> her face when it's full of pictures of her <br>Tonight. Me.</br></br>  <br> not wanting to hate fuck the twins for having such a shitty system </br>  <br>Nanami  is cute but I have a thing for twins. </br>  <br>I *do* know how hashes work, which is why I wonder what's the point. If someone wants to nail me for having CP, the hash of the files aren't important and is irrelevant.</br>  <br>Soon the twins will go into the trash too.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>Do you understand how photodna works?<br>Regular hash detection can be defeated by changing a single byte in the file.<br>If you're lazy, you can simply open up the pic and resave it in paint.<br>photodna can see through that because it gathers data about the image itself and looks for patterns.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it. I'm reinstalling xp. How could I betray my true os waifu?</br>  <br>The twins of course.<br><br><br>This.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You shouldn't get too attached to mere computer programs.</br></br></br>  <br>She wouldn't betray you, right?</br>  <br>Almost makes me feel sorry for XP IF ONLY IT WASN'T SUCH A PIECE OF CRAP!</br>  <br>I miss you XP, I miss you ;_;</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oNX<wbr>zMBA9VU4</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Inori is alive and well, anon.<br>I'm still using the voice pack that changes Windows' sound warning to her voice</br></br>  <br>Games are better now than they've ever been in the past.<br> exploring the past and meet historical people as an assassin in assassin's creed <br> going through space and making meaningful choices that affect the course of the story in mass effect <br> building anything you want in minecraft <br> going through a massive world with a deep lore in skyrim <br> messing with a huge sandbox that doubles as an extreme parody the united states in gta <br>The list goes on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Meh, I already have google-tan and apple spying on me.

My theme is all genuine Nanami, though I switched around some of the sounds because some of them didn't make sense given the context of the error.</br>  <br>I used the Nanami soundbank for a while, started to get on my nerves after  a year and a half </br>  <br>XP was a miserable pile of BSOD before SP1.</br>  Why isn't PC gaming represented in Gamindustri?  <br>I remember that anon. She was sobbing, freightened I would abandon her because she couldnt full service me to my needs. But I took pity upon her, held her close to me. Told her it was okay. Then SP1 came, I cuddled with her. gently pulled her pantsu down. She trusted me fully and was willing to get updated by me. I would take responsibility. Then I downloaded inside of her over and over again until she was full with SP1. She looked at me with her teary eyes and smiled, knowing she could tend to my every need from now on.</br>  <br>At least Inori speaks english</br>  <br> English </br>  <br>I'm not going to pretend I understand what the girl is saying in japanese, so I'll stick with her</br>  <br> Not wanting a cute nip girl whisper engrish into your ear. </br>  You've chosen your OS, /a/. Now what will your programming/scripting waifu of choice be?  <br>wheres my assembler waifu? Her body is a bombshell due the deficiency of coding in her.</br>  <br><br>Just go, dubfags.</br></br>  Windows 10-tan is worst girl.<br><br>Alas, the best girl is dead.</br></br>  <br>C and C++ are already Christmas Cakes, assembly would probably be rotting skeletons by now</br>  <br>Visual Basic hands down. My god, what a SHY QT</br>  <br>C# all days.</br>  <br>Assembly is a goddess, age does not touch her divine flesh like it does on those filthy wenches. Just look at rollercoaster tycoon.

A SHIT. </br></br>  <br>glad I'm not the only one, I still use the nanami wallpapers to this day though, gonna be a sad day when I finally have to say goodbye...</br>  <br>It's the computer I got stuck with after my old one bit the dust. About the only thing it really has over my old computer is the start-up time.</br>  <br><br> shilling </br></br>  <br>Suck my cock on /a/ :^{ )</br>  <br>The keyboard of my laptop (which I spent $100+ to downgrade from 8 to 7) got busted so I'm pretty much forced to use my sister's spare laptop with Windows 8 in the meantime, because apparently laptop parts of a 4th gen i7 laptop are hard to find.</br>  <br>100$ to downgrade?<br><br>What the fuck are you doing buddy. You pay like 2$ for a disc to burn windows on. 20$ if you are fancy with an USB stick.</br></br></br>  <br>Is she the cutest?</br>  <br>The cuter the OS-tan, the more useless they are?<br><br>Anyway I'm choosing 8.</br></br></br>  <br>I wanted a genuine win 7 on my laptop asap.</br>  <br> genuine win 7 <br>nigga they send win8 with it. You already paid your due so cracking a win7 isnt anything bad. If youre afraid of the non-genuine popups you have cracks that fix that.</br></br>  <br>I bought the laptop second hand and I'm not that tech savvy.</br>  <br>8.1, no problems.</br>  <br>Im not tech savvy either and I know how to put a fresh windows install on my computer. Heck the amount of times I was stupid enough to get a virus that didnt budge under antivirus from porn often enough to do the necessary steps on autopilot</br>  <br>I only know Java,javascript, html, PHP and a little bit of C and C#. <br><br>Probably go with Java and murder PHP, I fucking despise using PHP.</br></br></br>  Many years from now, what will be your final post to /a/?  <br>Unohana a best</br>  <br>Check em'.</br>  <br>gomenasai /a/</br>  <br>Kuroneko a shit.<br>Kirino best grill.</br></br>  <br>See ya Space cowb/a/s ?</br>  Anime is a mistake  This is a shit thread.

Whenever someone says something that the posters largely disagree with, /dng/ has been directing people to the /a/ thread. But when the do the same thing here, they redirect them to /dng/. <br><br>I'm just wondering if there was some sort of conflict between the two threads, or if SOMETHING happened, here. I've honestly been out of the loop for a while.</br></br>   not posting the best girl for a new thread. <br>its like you fags dotn even care anymore.</br>  WHEN?    <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Pixiv makes it hard for me to take Yuri seriously some times. They seem to like the idea that he's obsessed with mochi.</br>  <br>/a/rc-v talks about the anime and some times about the card game which can go on with out people fling shit on each other and say X card is better that X card, from what ive seen people in arc-v thread are some what nicer than that shit-hole /dng/, while as people who ENJOY playing pet decks &amp; having fun /dng/ is where fun goes to die.</br>  <br>If you wanna talk about Nationals or Regionals go to /dng/.<br><br>If you wanna talk about the mysteries of the Ruris, post here.<br><br>Above all else don't be a meta-posting faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll get her spot light soon.

What should he do? <br>Guess anyway and read more. If you haven't even read like 5 VNs yet, you're still a japanese baby. Just make sure you are paying attention to when things make sense. Guessing well means being able to go "I'm a little confused, but pretty much know what this is saying so I'm gonna keep going". It doesn't mean making something up when you actually have no idea.<br><br>Just remember that you're going to be seeing almost every grammatical construction hundreds if not thousands of times. Common things you will see hundreds of times in a single VN. It's extremely hard to greatly misunderstand something and still not realize it after seeing it 20 times, so as long as you're realizing your mistakes by the 20th time or so then your Japanese learning isn't being hurt a single bit.<br><br>Maybe your understanding of the first couple things you read will be shit, but that's not important long term.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks. (Shit it really is hard to read.)<br><br>I'll probably go through it since it's structured which I imagine is better than the sin of using DOJG as a textbook. Plus I get to feel like a smug git going through the beginner parts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, I suppose if you're really so uncomfortable with the language that you guess most things wrong, the best advice is probably to read a graded reader for a bit first.</br>  <br> Just a reminder that this hobby does get easier each and everyday. <br>No. Not something that's this faceted. Not something that's cumulative. At least not uniformly.

Currently I've only done Tae Kim's "complete" guide and went to grind RTK immediately after.<br>My daily work :<br>1) Anki reviews<br>2) Learn 15 new RTK1 Kanji<br>3) Add them to my Anki deck<br>1400 Kanji in, according to my calculations it ends on September 6th.<br>Advice for what to do next ? I want to be comfortable with Japanese a little as I'm going for an internship there next June. My original idea was to split it up into : 8 to 10 RTK2 + 8 to 10 vocab words.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know there's a deck made for RTK right?</br>  <br>Yes but I don't like it. I prefer to manually manage my deck by adding only new Kanjis I've learned thoroughly on the resource material.<br>I will certainly do the same with vocab, I can't stand premade decks.</br></br>  <br>You aren't going to learn shit with RTK, much less using RTK alone. Unless anki reviews means core deck.<br>Go read the guide.</br></br>   rtk <br> anki <br> 2015 <br>k im out</br></br></br>  <br>RTK is there to help you retain the vocab faster, and to learn how to write with pencil an paper. Not for actually learning kanji meaning.<br>You should be doing 2k/6k or 10k alongside RTK, don't wait after you finish it.</br></br>  <br>bye</br>  <br>Read Yotsuba</br>  <br> Learn 15 new RTK1 Kanji <br>That's a slow pace for RTK. Use the Koohii stories and do 50 a day. Also, do the Core decks (30-50 words a day) and read Tae Kim.</br></br>  <br>I seriously hope you at least learning main ON readings for each kanji when you do RTK. <br>If yes then just blaze through 6k once you're done with kanji and start reading. If no then you have to learn all those joyo kanji all over again.</br></br>  <br>I know that individual Kanji is useless to read Japanese, but I thought it would be a good idea to store a bank a Kanji in my mind so I can assimilate vocab w/ Kanji easier.<br><br><br>See above + it's cool to be able to write them, too.<br><br><br>It's the best I can do considering the time I have to study Japanese every day. I pretty much don't do anything else when I have free time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't let the door hit you on your way out, nigger.</br>  <br>I study math and physics everyday and do 1-2 hours of muay thai. I still have time to study at least 3-4 hours of japanese, manage your time better.</br>  <br><br>Sorry.</br></br>  <br>Well, you're really good if you can wrap up reviews + 50 new Kanjis in 3 hours, I know I couldn't do it. After 2 hours I start to burn out on strictly Kanji because it doesn't make me understand Japanese better, merely improving my character set for future learnings.<br>In general you guys are just way above me, but I'm already happy that the unproductive sack of shit I am can do something productive 2 hours a day.</br></br>  <br> Well, you're really good if you can wrap up reviews + 50 new Kanjis in 3 hours <br> 3 hours <br>Do you write out the kanji? Not doing that will probably save you a lot of time. It might defeat the purpose of RtK, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't writing out kanji help make it stick better?</br>  <br>Yeah about the topic you are going to present , but somehting as differente as japanese, i dont see the problem</br>  <br> Do 50 a day <br> I can only just about manage 25 with Koohii </br></br>  <br>I write every single Kanji during review and learnings. I feel like even if the image is clear in my head, if I don't write it it's cheating in my opinion. At least I can write them all properly, quickly, in correct order.</br>  <br> I know that individual Kanji is useless to read Japanese <br>Not really, it helps a lot.<br>Once you know their reading looking things up in a dictionary stops being a pain, and you can read and remember most of compounds on your first try, unless they use some crazy irregular reading or ateji.<br><br>Knowing only Heisig keywords for them is truly useless, however.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The anons who do 50 a day probably either have good memory, are bullshiting, or are on amphetamines/ extremely high amount of caffeine.</br>  <br>It certainly does. But if it takes too long it could be worth considering not doing it. I didn't do rtk myself, but when I did the core6k I think it cut down my time by 50% when I stopped writing out the words.</br>  <br>My idea was to learn compounds with Heisig keywords. Like learn them as "Today = Now + Day", kinda like the Kanji alone, minus the necessary bullshit stories. RTK2 covers the readings, right ?</br>  <br>Nice blog.</br>  We can all agree that Cory in the House is the best anime ever made, right?  <br>Haha, you're old and you're going to die soon, grandpa.</br>  Four days in a row and it's still epic, get 'em /b/ro!

Or maybe  even the very first Carol is a homunculus.   <br>I am surprised she still has KUROI GUNGNIR? since Igalima and Shul Shagana were updated with white color schemes. Understandable since they don't want her to look TOO much like Kanade, but still kinda surprising.</br>  <br>So since she's a body surfing old hag with a few vampiric traits (the whole memories thing), is Carol basically a genderflipped Zouken Matou?</br>   Project Ignite <br> Those spiky looking gears. <br><br>Who thought it was a good idea?</br></br></br>  <br>What a twist!</br>  <br>Updates happen with X-drives, and Maria never X-drived with Gungnir.</br>  <br>Fine was better.

Like fear. Or laughter. Something outside of the box like that.<br><br>Atleast a sound logia would be neat.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why a logia and not paramytia?</br>  <br>zoro best nova but non SH Urogue<br>Kid best nova fruit<br>everyone knows best 63 is killer</br></br></br>  <br>He is talking about Moria's shadow. The shadow is it's own entity.</br>  <br>are you saying Capone is the best nova<br><br>a fruit that doesnt exist yet if the best DF <br><br>and that Lucky Roo is the best genderbend? The fuck is wrong with you?<br><br><br> girl with no face is somehow the best example of a genderbend </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> apoo was the sound logia all along </br>  <br>Because paramecias do not change their body like that. I would want a guy who can simply burst into a bunch of spiders that crawl into dark corners or somethign like that.</br>  <br> He's gonna be an absolute hax monster <br><br>This is what im hoping for. Used to his full potential(as in not gimped by the plot), he should be unstoppable</br></br></br>  <br>usopp his probably immortal, making his fears irrelevant. he just doesn't know it.</br>  <br>Luffy?</br>  <br>Everyone has different opinions and kinemon has the fruit</br>  <br><br> Humans are weird. You can take 10 shots and walk out of it, and people had, or you can slip on an orange peel and die.<br> People don't have life bars. Certain parts of the body are more fragile than others. Being a kid your skeleton is weaker. Ussop wasn't hit in the head hard enough, just all around it. Perhaps Ussop was hit in the head at the right place, but had so much adrenaline due to the fear and emotion he wasn't affected, that happens, or his blood was flowing too fast and didn't form a clog. Anything really.<br> <br> Justifications are easy to find.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the mask gives her a kinky sadist vibe you pleb</br>  Apoo is Kanye West of the OPverse.<br>Y'all just haters.</br>  <br>Not the Zombies. His shadow was seemingly sentient enough to go fuck knows where with Luffy. His bats too. It's arguable if they can be called "alive" but you get the idea.</br>  <br> and kinemon has the fruit <br>how is making disguises somehow the best DF power<br><br>and Lucky Roux? Really? where the hell did you even find a pic of 63!Roux?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have my ways</br>  <br> Kanye West of the OPverse. <br>Don't downgrade Apoo like that you shit.</br></br>  <br>luffy doesnt take as much damage cause of his fruit, even if blunt attacks hurt him they get mitigated a bit. <br><br>though it could be that luffy has taken more damage</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is a given really seeing as he completely blows the crew out of the water except for maybe Zoro or 'God' Usopp.</br>  I don't know where and it might be a shitty translation, but I read how someone in OP said something along the lines of "the strongest man of the seven seas".<br>What are the seven seas refered to here?<br><br>the four blues, the calm belt, the grandline, and? Does New world count as its own sea? But then there would be four calm belts aswell. So it makes no sense to say "the seven seas". Or is the calm belt seen as a part of the grand line and the seventh sea is the all blue? (Four blues, grand line, new world, all blue.)</br></br></br>  <br> kinky sadist vibe <br><br><br>it's like you dont understand Killer's character or personality at all</br></br></br></br>  <br> No DF has ever created life </br>  <br>But moriah didn't create it he stole it</br>  <br>I do. I know he's motherly and shit, and a pretty mellow guy. I was talking about the aesthetics.</br>  <br>Not the shadows he stole<br><br>HIS shadow was sentient. he could also switch places with it at will which led luffy on a wild goose chase. <br><br>His shadow also was the one that would cut and free other shadows. It's pretty hard to fight against it as it's always a 2 vs 1.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about those qt shadow bats? Are they all an entire human shadow?<br><br>Also, could Moria steal the shadow of the moon during an eclipse? Would the moon then burn in the sun?</br></br></br>  <br>He's also, you know, a rubber man.</br>  <br>does anyone know what's going on with the PC version of this? I've heard all sorts of conflicting info about online play and costume availability and such</br>  <br> I was talking about the aesthetics. <br><br>I guess I see what you're getting at but I cant see past the Daft Punk</br></br></br>  <br>You never have to buy clothes ever again and you can't tell me u don't want a female lucky roo sharing her meat with u</br>  <br> awakening <br> Moria threatens to destroy the moon, which is where One Piece is <br> Kaido knew this all along. He was trying to take out Moria before this. </br></br></br>  <br>That explains lot because I can't stand Kanye either.<br><br>Law, Yami Yami, X Drake</br></br></br>  <br> You never have to buy clothes ever again <br>actually that would be a pretty convenient fruit to have in the real world.</br></br>  <br>Zoro<br>Hobby hobby (if it works like how I think it works<br>Alvida</br></br></br>  <br>But it's not like they were actual life they can't feel pain and have no free will</br>  <br>Didn't know Alvida was a supernova.</br>  <br>They don't take up space too. You can anything you want for the rest of your lives. But of course, no swimming and no relaxing baths</br>  <br>It didn't say the rule 63 had to be a supernova</br>  <br>they mean Alvida is best genderbend</br>  <br><br>Maybe he's just lying because he really didn't want to go back to his family.</br></br>  <br>that shit is plausible in real life, just saying.</br>  <br>I agree that his shadow was sentient but what I'm trying to say is no devil fruit has created life that can live on its own</br>  <br>And that's the way I imagine those spiders of the spider logia.</br>  <br><br>But then what about Ace.</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>Well the objects that got forcefed zoan fruits by vegapunk fit your definition. Funkfreed and the Gundog</br>    <br>Kanye knows what he's doing. He's hilarious.<br>You just gotta roll with it.</br></br>  <br> mfw <br/></br>  <br>No one who thinks it is shitty writing thinks it because it would be unreasonable.<br><br><br> Also, could Moria steal the shadow of the moon during an eclipse? Would the moon then burn in the sun? <br>Holy fucking shit, what.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck is that</br>  <br>What the fuck am I looking at ?</br>  <br>Well you got me there I don't know what to say to that</br>  <br>I am glad everyone is confused as I am</br>  <br> No one who thinks it is shitty writing thinks it because it would be unreasonable. <br>then what's the fucking problem. seems like that's what OP was implying with his post</br></br>  <br>What's under the hat?</br>  <br>Oh I remember seeing this on the one piece website. It's the new cover for the wano character with the new side characters. They look pretty cool</br>  Volume 79 cover predictions are are incoming. Neat.  <br>The actual problem is that it is a cheap copp-out to use the "He had amnesia all along!" plot device to bring a beloved character into the show whom we never met or heard of before.<br><br>Listen, I really don't want to start another three hours discussion about this, we just had that one or two threads ago. So excuse me if I don't reply further if you are trying to discuss this now.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the actual cover is it?...</br>  Psst....<br>Streaming Little Garden.<br>http://www.livestream.com/thisfinet<wbr>emperedstream <br><br>Bring snacks.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Fuckin' MS paint</br>  <br>KEK. I hope this is it, so i could watch penguinfag's loyalty crumble.</br>  <br>Do you even read?</br>  <br><br>It's the place with the helpful hardware folk.</br></br>  <br>Oh no. I will never be able to unsee this.</br>    What would happen to crocs main body If you trapped half of it in a glass jar?  <br>I'm not. But you're wrong if you don't think people are shitting about it because they don't think it's plausible like OP.</br>  <br>I guess it wouldn't be able to return to its original form and Croc'll be forced to stay sand?</br>  <br> a clone of Luffy, Law and Kidd as the same guy <br> Gin 2.0 <br>Well, shit</br></br></br>  <br><br>Logia seem to reform from the feet first when knocked into elemental form<br><br>not sure if it's necessary or what.</br></br></br></br>  Should Usopp be a part of the monster trio or maybe monster quartet? Those plant seeds he's gotten post-timeskip literally give him so many options and it would be cool seeing the cowardly guy from early one piece become the pirate who beats the shit out of admirals.  <br>Well, they are morons.</br>  <br>You guess or you know?</br>  <br>A-are you from the f-future?</br>  So, how does the Volume Cover predictions work ? Does Oda say what the cover is gonna have and people try to draw it ? Does he pick the best one ?  <br>Ussop is the weakest crewmember though.....</br>  <br> Should Usopp be a part of the monster trio or maybe monster quartet?  <br>No. He's still a backup fighter. I feel like the monster trio fits more with the brawlers of the crew.</br></br>  <br>You can't be apart of the monster trio without both forms of Haki. He is definitely doing somethings posttimeskip but this is just the bare minimum of what new world fighters need to be capable of.<br><br>he couldn't even beat caribou as he is right now. That disqualifies him.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;implying I'd dislike Penguin being OPM <br><br>On the topic of Penguin's hair, though, I think I've seen fan art of every color by this point<br> bald <br> blond <br> silver <br> white <br> red <br> black <br> blue </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck is he supposed to know ?

My bad. Stay blasted, bro.</br>  <br>and Shachi!</br>  <br>Stop replying I'm not talking to you</br>  <br>how do you guys even know who anyone but jean bart and bepo are in laws crew. like the other guys are generic faceless people how are they interesting at all? and why does jean bart never appear in any heart crew fan art?</br>  <br>It's turning other people into her.</br>  <br>Blue haired Penguin reminds me of a movie I watched when I was little called Scamper the Penguin <br><br><br>That's why I ask people to appreciate them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just tumblr/deviantartfags having fun</br>  <br> why does jean bart never appear in any heart crew fan art? <br>Jean Bart isn't yaoi bait, nor is he kawaii..</br></br>  How do people get excited for new One Piece chapters? It's been dull for fucking years, haven't read a new chapter in weeks.  What do you guys think of a gender bender arc where ivankov accidentally turns the SH crew into the opposite gendors? And they have fights with their new bodies  <br>I just wanna see an admiral or yonko fight already. This series turned to shit after marineford</br>  <br> and why does jean bart never appear in any heart crew fan art? <br>Because he's ugly and fujo's don't like ugly. They're pretty superficial when it comes to these things even though most of them are SJWs who shit on artists who draw their idealistic depictions of women more often than fat 'realistic' females.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd imagine awakened Robin is her clone having the ability to use the devil fruit powers as well</br></br>  I'm really bored.

The scene with Kokoro and Mayucchi playing shadow puppets was my favorite part of that route.</br>  <br>I was enjoying Kokoro route up until the pee started.</br>  <br>I disagree. She was rather  pissy </br>  <br><br>Admittedly, I'm not a fan of stuff like that either. Sex scenes weren't really the main thing for me, however, so sexual content that isn't to my taste isn't that big a deal. Maybe I'm enjoying Majikoi wrong or something. Exception to this is Margit's route, where the sex scenes actually were the main thing for me.</br></br>  <br>That's because the H-scenes in Margit's route were god tier.</br>  <br> ku ku ku translated as keh keh keh </br>  <br>They really were.

Two or three.<br>Though I fully expect something horrible to happen at some point to completely ruin any hopes of that.</br></br>  <br> A-5 soon <br><br>I'll believe it when I see it.<br><br> Margit is my hentaifu </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The team working on A is different from the one who worked on Majikoi and S, right?<br><br>Maybe there's the possibility of a merger. That might speed things up a little. The A team also got a new translator a couple days ago too.<br><br>I'll remain cautiously hopeful for now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because it's edit to be readable doesn't mean that it's even close to the original text. Fuwatards take the script, run it through a machine translator, guess what it means, and then edit it so that the grammar is correct and the text makes sense to them.</br>  <br>Hopefully the team that did S will pick the rest of A up once they finish A-1.<br>I'm hopeful that it will be a year at most.<br><br><br>The team that did S is also working on A-1 as far as I know, it's halfway done.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, what are some notable inaccuracies in the translation?</br>  <br>sweet, although i haven't done that route yet. in the middle of miyako route now, and already done momoyo first then tatsuko and yukie.</br>  <br>I like just about all the girls there.<br><br>Well, Tsubame's a bit hard to accept though. I guess I like her, but I also feel a bit unhappy about her story. It felt kinda dirty.<br><br>My heart did almost skip a beat when she started crying after Yamato rejects her, though. A woman's tears are terrifying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why are they using two separate sites? That's kinda weird.</br>  <br> Well, Tsubame's a bit hard to accept though. I guess I like her, but I also feel a bit unhappy about her story. It felt kinda dirty. <br>I kind of thought that dirtiness made the version where Yamato takes the lead that much better.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, faggot. You just bitch for the sake of bitching. As long as it's good enough for the people that care about it, it's fine. <br><br>Why didn't you translate it yourself if you have problems? Instead all you do is sit here on your ass bitching. <br><br>I'm at least grateful it was translated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go check /jp/ or the archive if you want that. I just know enough about fuwanovel to stay away from anything they touch.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with complaining when there are reasons to complain. Even translators themselves, if they're serious about doing a good job, would benefit form criticism. I'd just like to hear something more than "It's shit", like specific examples of mistranslations that genuinely change the meaning of things.</br>  <br> I'm at least grateful it was translated. <br>So you don't care at all about the original story and are fine with reading a rewrite/fan fiction? Knock yourself out reading that trash then, but stay away from these threads.</br></br>  <br>Mm.<br><br>It's hard to say. When Tsubame takes the lead, I feel that Yamato was more effective as a leash. But when Yamato takes the lead, you end up seeing just how much of an idiot she is. <br><br>I guess that's part of her charm, though. I don't dislike her, but it still feels a little bad. I get that Momoyo needed to lose to someone her own age, but her methods were still a little unsightly.<br><br>I'm not talking about how she studied Momoyo, of course. But using Yamato's feelings for her and making Momoyo go wild with that felt kinda excessive. I think that goes past pragmatism and starts dipping into cruelty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just read through S, and while there are some issues with the translation, for the most part, it's actually pretty accurate. I don't think it's all machine translation.</br>  Just finished Miyako's route, cute as fuck in this one.  <br>The problems it that the retards only give unproductive criticism. All they do is complain the translation is shit, without giving valid examples. They are just annoying and all they do is made the threads shittier.</br>  Koyuki got shafted hard as fuck, holy shit.<br><br>She barely even shows up in her route and she has literally one h-scene, which is also super short.</br></br>  Do both titles have fan made uncensor adjustments to lewd pictures?  <br>Majikoi has uncensors, and I think the S ones are in progress.</br>   that fucking ending picture though <br><br><br>man i was looking forward to her as well when i found out she was in this one.</br></br></br>  <br>The cutest!</br>  <br>I know what you mean. I was looking forward to it hard, but it was a letdown. Even some of the meme characters had longer H-scenes.<br><br>Also I thought her route could've used more  feels .</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can understand why Koyuki's would be like that, though. They had to create an entirely new universe for her. All the other routes branch off from more or less the same point (with the exception of the After routes), but with Koyuki, they had to go way further back.</br></br>  <br>I didn't really like Miyako that much in Majikoi, though I didn't exactly dislike her either, but she really was cute in S.</br>  Damn Chris's route was shit. What the fuck went wrong?  <br>Her route could have branched from Agave After pretty easily.<br><br>In fact, it makes the most sense there. A lot of Agave After involves Yamato trying to get Koyuki to open up but then it out of no where it turns into the Tatsuko route(which honestly should have been called "Itagaki Family" rather than Tatsuko) and Koyuki just disappears.</br></br></br>  <br>Mm. I guess they didn't want to go too far with that. Koyuki's broken. She's mentally stuck as a child. I guess it would be hard for Yamato to overcome that boundary.</br>  <br>It's understandable, she does questionable things in her route and won't stop showing up in other peoples routes.<br><br><br>In the first Majikoi?<br> The middle and end were rewritten from the ground up when the writers decided not to kill off Miyako </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Her route in the main game wasn't bad, but was a bit disappointing. Her route in S is great, though.<br><br><br><br>Are we talking original or S? For the original, I just really hated the daddy issue thing dragging on and being repetitive. The ending was a bit silly as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really doubt your spoiler is true. Where did you hear that? It doesn't seem like the sort of thing they were going for with Majikoi at all. Source?</br></br>  <br> Mm. I guess they didn't want to go too far with that. Koyuki's broken. She's mentally stuck as a child. I guess it would be hard for Yamato to overcome that boundary. <br>Personally I would also kind of dislike anyone becoming closer to that Koyuki than Jun and Touma. It would just feel inappropriate to me, somehow.</br></br>  <br>It's inappropriate in a lot of ways.<br><br>Yamato's able to get closer to her, but he closed that route when he rejected her as a child. That path's gone forever for him. There's nothing he can do about that now.</br></br></br>  Anyone played Azumi's route? I'm looking forward to its eventual translation.  <br>It's been a while since I read about it on some nip forum. Honestly I'm not even sure it's true any more and I'd rather it not be. There are several signs in game that point to that possibility existing though.<br>Note in Mayucchi's route Miyako contemplates jumping from the rooftop of the base just because Yamato picked a newcomer over her, Nee-san was just there to cheer her up. Also note that Miyako also likes Chris significantly less than Mayucchi. You also can't deny the fact that the writing quality suddenly dips for no reason in Chris's route either.</br></br>  <br>I did. I loved it.<br><br>Yamato works really hard to earn Azumi's affections. He falls for her and falls for her hard, but he never gives up on her, ever. She keeps rejecting him, but he keeps going. I loved it just because of how hard he worked for it. I think he worked harder in that route than he does in any other.</br></br></br>   That Benkei scene in Koyuki's route <br><br>Holy shit. I didn't really care about Benkei much but that scene had my heart pounding.<br><br>I hope they finish A-1 soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn that sounds good. Might have to break out TA for this one.</br>  <br>I loved Benkei from the moment she started speaking. I actually like all the clones.<br><br>The second-hand embarrassment from whenever Koichi speaks is amazing. It's almost terrifying.</br></br></br>  <br>I find it silly that the clones didn't get routes in S, but I guess they were just bait for the A games.</br>  <br>S had a lot of bait for A. A truly ludicrous amount. There are a large number of scenes which connect to the A games. It was definitely on purpose.</br>  So, is A-5 canned or what? There's been no update about it in a long damn time, and the last one came out at the tail end of November.  <br>Haguro looks amazing.</br>  I want to into Majikoi. Am I right in saying it's Majikoi -&gt; Majikoi S -&gt; Majikoi A1?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Why does S come before A1?</br>  <br>Sweet, thanks.</br>    <br>Because it was released first.</br>  <br>Colour her hair yellow in this image and she may as well be Leone.<br><br>Asakawa voices amazing girls.</br></br></br>  <br>It is worth it.<br><br>For me, if you are looking for a light hearted and comedic VN with great art, awesome VAs and delicious and gratuitous (voiced) sex scenes, this is the best VN out there.</br></br></br>    What does the "S" stand for? What does the "A" stand for?  <br>So that's what the ominous prophecy from the prologue was all about? I was confused when it was brought up in Miyako's route but then it never came true in any route, ever.<br><br>It makes a lot of sense if it was some cut off content. I really liked Chris's route though, Chris's dad was awesome.</br></br></br>  <br>For me it is probably the best route released in the A series. Her's or Lee's anyways.<br><br>Her route felt like a proper progression, with both her and Yamato working towards a finishing point, rather than just hooking up instantly and fucking.<br><br>And her H-scenes were fantastic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally nothing.</br>  So does Momoyo get buttfucked in S? I was a bit disappointing when it didn't happen in the original VN.  <br> You also can't deny the fact that the writing quality suddenly dips for no reason in Chris's route either. <br><br>Hmm, you have a point there.</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>It seems the Goddess of War's defenses are a bit too high for that.</br></br></br>  <br>I think she does, yes. They all do.  Even Wanko </br>  <br>W-where do I find such a game?</br>  Best girl.     bestshit     <br>God her body is perfect.<br><br>Sometimes her sprite can look a bit top heavy, but seeing her like this is close to perfection.</br></br></br>  <br>She did, in her last sex scene.</br>  <br><br>Worst route for her, sadly. That's why I'm hoping her After route makes up for that.</br></br>  I started reading through Miyako's route shortly after it was finally translated, but so far I haven't been able to finish it. I didn't expect it to be that dull. Worst route, without a doubt.  <br> strongest person alive <br> trains every day essentially from birth <br> still has this extremely full feminine figure <br><br>Momo's body is fucking magic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After Wanko's route it kinda had a hard act to follow.</br>  <br/>  <br>Why would they release something titled "S" before "A1"?</br>  <br>Because Takahiro didnt plan that far ahead and only had the idea for A after S was a success and fans demanded more Majikoi.</br>  <br><br>She fires lasers that can go past Earth's atmosphere. So yes, magic.<br><br> Also, love. </br></br></br></br>    Will they also be translating the A games  <br> sauce? </br>   That Benkei scene in Yuki's route. <br><br>I need A-1 one man. I need it. Both her and Azumi.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like my kind of game.</br>  <br> H-haiyai </br>  <br>I want to berry my face in that ass.</br>  <br>Pervert!!!</br>  If only the anime had been 100% comedy and they left that trash with Takei to one side.<br><br>Its comedic episodes were god tier and could have come straight from the VN.</br></br>  <br>I want to berry my nose and mouth and eyes between those ass cheeks and take a long whiff and breathe out again.</br>  <br><br>It really felt like it was a pull from management. The comedy bits felt natural, since the series does it somewhat well. But the "serious plot" they tried to have came off as extremely plastic and pointless to add on to a series that established itself with comedy early.<br><br>I can't fathom that was their intention, but I'm guessing they wanted more battle sequences and other bullshit. Or at least the upper management did.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I can't fathom that was their intention, but I'm guessing they wanted more battle sequences and other bullshit. Or at least the upper management did. <br><br>Takahiro certainly didnt want this. I recall him being somewhat mad as fuck about how the anime staff threated the adaption.</br></br></br>  <br>Should have been a 1 to 1 of the Manga tbh</br>  <br><br>Character interactions and gag bits are the soul of the series. Battle are there, but not exactly the strongest point of them. So yeah, I can see why he'd be a bit pissed off.</br></br>  <br>hopefully, i want benkei route.</br>  <br>There were a couple of manga adaptions though.</br>  I still dream of a second season of the anime.<br><br>Better than that, I dream of a totally new adaption that uses all the girls accross the series and is mainly pure lighthearted, happy fun.<br><br>I dont mind a little bit of drama as long as it is resolved amicably and humorously.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Instead of translating "sorry" it's often put as "my b"</br>  <br>I was wondering what the fuck was up with that.<br><br>Not even "My bad", just "My b"<br><br>Was a middle schooler editing this shit or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really?<br>I only read one.</br></br>  <br>Oh, I forgot about that. Will that become true?</br>  I was thinking a little bit earlier about wanko's "lack of talent" and that it likely has nothing to do with her ability.<br>but then it struck me that, wanko is one of the few characters that does not come from some sort of 200 year warrior tradition genetic stock, which gives a predisposition of having a large potential to be a warrior (as long as they train their abilities)<br>lineage of course isn't everything like pic related believes, but it does seem to affect the characters maximum abilities.<br>Wanko does work a lot harder during her training than most of the other characters, but even with the great training she's received, she is still not the child of a strong person.<br>But in addition to this, she is also one of the few characters that has the highest morals and would not intentionally do something they normally see as wrong unless there was very good reason, and although they help in yamato's schemes often, they do not resort to tricks them self.<br><br>so with those two things going against her, coming this far on willpower and drive to succeed alone, and although she has reached her likely peak in strength at the point of failure she still manages to be one of the strongest fighters in a school full of warriors.<br><br>How far do you think she'd have gone if instead of being an orphan, her parents were world class warriors like the rest of the main cast? <br>What if she just played dirty like Azumi?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yea, the fortune teller shows up at the end of Miyako's route to confirm you've dealt with the problem at hand.</br>  I'm going to bed. Be excellent to each other, okay?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128539981 <br> Forgot his own tripcode <br><br><br>They've been doing weekly updates for the past few weeks so it's obviously not dead. Not to mention the whole Yoshitsune 150k buyers picture that came out last week</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her lack of a family traditions isnt the only issue. The main thing is that she started training in martial arts far too late in life.<br><br>Majikoi has a running theme of "the earlier you start in life the better", meaning that someone who started when they were 5 will forever have an unassailable lead over someone who started at 11.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, who is that supposed to be?</br></br>  Am I the only one excited for Takae?<br><br>I mean, Yoshitsune we all know will be fantastic and supercute, and Margits one will be nice just having an actual route and storyline.<br><br>Takae intrigues me the most though. And her design is a great mix of beautiful and cute. And unfortunate-moe is a strong moe indeed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lisa, one of the new girls that will be appearing in A-5</br>  <br>Man I just want Benkei and Azumi for now. I'll consider myself fortunate if those get translated.</br>  <br> this cutiepie <br>Holy fuck Minatosoft have dont it again</br></br>  <br>That wasn't me though</br>  I hope Yukie will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.  <br><br><br><br>ï¼you will never have your margrit and chris harem</br></br></br></br>  <br>This girl is in Wanko territories of cute.<br><br>i.e. dangerously cute.</br></br></br>   No Kokoro After route <br><br>Only sadness now.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Poor Kokoro does seem to have been kinda abandoned by Minatosoft. Her route in S wasnt much better than Margits but Maru is getting a rout ein A to fix it.<br><br>Maybe she will get some redemption in a future Majikoi game.</br></br></br>  <br>she has still trained far harder than some of the others and surpassed them in the time she has had, such as kokoro<br>gakuto as well, who's family certainly has a disposition with brute strength, and was still fairly strong long before wanko started training.</br></br>  <br> but Maru is getting a route in A to fix it. <br>Well Maru is the most popular Majikoi by a rather large margin so this is to be expected.</br></br>  <br>You can't deny that genes can help you be predispositioned to things so it probably could have helped her.<br>Inherent skill is a major factor though, especially in Majikoi. <br>Just look at Tatsuko.<br>But I wonder if Wanko's training is even worth it in the end.<br>In her own route she works harder than ever, and yet she still can't beat Chris.<br>Wanko pushes herself harder than many people, but at the end of the day, does she really have the talent to reach her dreams? I feel really bad for Wanko, she's like the punching bag for new characters to show the audience that their tough, and someone as cute and hardworking as her doesn't deserve that kind of treatment.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I-is she Takae's Imouto?<br><br><br>Dont look at it too literally. Its a light hearted comedy first and foremost. Wanko has been shown in multipe routes to be capeable of holding her own against very strong people. She is definately way above a normal person, she just wont ever achieve a rank of where she is 2nd to Momo.<br><br>And lets be honest, even the girls stronger than her wouldnt be able to achieve that position either. Out of the ones we have seen, only Mayuuchi or the clones could ever get a rank of Assistant Master in the Kawakami dojo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>To be fair, it's not like Chris is a slouch either. She trains every day.</br></br>  <br> I-is she Takae's Imouto? <br>More like one of Margit's hounds, also the badge design is quite literal.</br></br>  <br> Well Maru is the most popular Majikoi by a rather large margin so this is to be expected. <br><br>[Citation needed]<br><br><br> and yet she still can't beat Chris. <br>She put Chris in hospital for two months, anon. They were fairly evenly matched. And again, you are looking at that from a perspective of "she couldnt do it then, so she never would be able to".<br><br>That was never said at all. Wanko in the short space of time she has been training has come extremely far. There is every possibility that she would end up being someone who would easily school Chrs. However, it still wouldnt be enough to be Assistant Master. That was the main focus of her route. <br><br>It isnt that she is weak and it isnt that she wont get any stronger. Far from it. Its that she wont achieve the heights she wants to achieve.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anon <br>Bitch nigga tripshit ain't no anon.</br></br>  <br>Fuck it I dont care. Thats how I reply to people on 4chin.</br>  <br>What about Lu? He reached top tier despite starting out as a normal man with no strong genes.</br>  <br>I understand what you two are saying, but in Wanko's route she works extra hard, and IIRC Chris just continues her daily routine. <br>If she can't beat Chris like that in a straight fight I doubt she'd ever reach Momoyo's level, which is where she would need to be to become an assistant instructor.<br><br><br>They shouldn't have been as easily match though, especially with all the extra work she put in.<br> It isnt that she is weak and it isnt that she wont get any stronger. Far from it. Its that she wont achieve the heights she wants to achieve. <br>That's partially my point all in all.<br><br><br>Hey no need to be rude.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is the German military filled with cute girls?</br>  <br>He had good inherent talent, and even then IIRC he barely passed.</br>  <br>Has this been resurrected? I liked this series and Mayuchhi was so sexy.</br>  <br>The first two games are now fully translated.</br>  <br>Majikoi and Majikoi-S have been fully translated so there is a little buzz now.</br>  <br> You can't deny that genes can help you be predispositioned to things so it probably could have helped her. <br> Inherent skill is a major factor though, especially in Majikoi. <br>Sure, but special genes obviously aren't absolutely necessary to become truly strong. I'm pretty sure it was mentioned that Lu was born as just a regular person, and as an Assistant Master of Kawakami Temple he's a reasonably big deal as a martial artist. Genes help but they aren't everything.</br></br></br>  <br> I understand what you two are saying, but in Wanko's route she works extra hard, and IIRC Chris just continues her daily routine. <br>I believe that Chris also started her training at an earlier age than Wanko, which gives her an advantage, both because she's got more training and experience behind her and because learning certain things and developing certain abilities is easier when you're a child.</br></br>  <br>"Can help"<br>not<br> absolutely necessary. <br>Which is why I mentioned that Lu must have had at least some inherent "talent" along side all his hardwork</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chris started training in the military at a very young age.</br>  What kind of monster would say no to this face?  Its been so long I'd have to read the whole thing from the start to do the remaining routes on Majikoi and Miyako just isn't worth it to me.  <br>I don't know anon.<br>She's lovely.<br> Here's a fixed version of that image (without the white dots) </br></br></br>  <br> fucking someone <br> when they have a cold <br><br>Eww no.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then skip through it to get to Agave.</br>  <br>I'd have to read the long prologue again too. <br><br>Its been what, 3 years since the Wanko route came out? That was the last thing I read.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Skipping Miyako's route <br> saying no to that face <br><br><br>That's not what he meant /a/non</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> [Citation needed] <br>1st.

Its still pretty shit taste.</br></br></br>  Enlighten me, anons.Why are there people treating Koyuki's route as the true route?  <br>I liked it. I specially liked how Gakuto was relevant. Made it up for all the shit he gets in the other routes.</br>  <br>Best route in the series but it's obviously not the true route, the only thing that could be considered as the true route is Agave and that in itself is up to debate.</br>  <br> Lee and Seiso are better than Miyako <br>Those are fighting words.<br><br>Also I miss threads occasionally so no, I haven't seen these before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the longest length bit of anything in there by a sizable amount, and incorporates otherwise exclusive aspects from other routes (Tsubame's super suit, for example). Also it's got a similar feel to Agave route with the way the battle plays out, and unlock conditions are similar.</br>  <br>Rinchuu a qt though. I can understand them voting for her. I too, would have gave her my vote.</br>  <br><br>Miyako's route and her character just aren't that good. Her route especially. <br><br>I love Stacy, but her route turned out to be none too great. But the positive on that, is Lee's route was pretty damn good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agave is one of my favorite routes.<br>Everyone gets their time in the spotlight.<br>I just hate how the continuation in S doesn't finish the Koyuki storyline if you pick the family over the Itagaki Sisters.<br><br><br> Miyako's route isn't that good <br>Granted, bit too much drama.<br> her character isn't that good <br>No, she's lovely and her persistence is too be admired.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin seems lovely. I would love to play her route.</br>   As good as every girl gets a route.Even Chika,Azumi and Kokoro. <br> Still no route for Ageha. <br> But Mon-sama gets one. <br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Ageha in another game?</br>  <br> persistence is too be admired <br><br>That's the only thing. It works well as a gag, but as you can see, it didn't work so well as a complete route. I love her as a side character, but she's not heroine material.</br></br></br>  <br> Those are fighting words. <br>Here is some more.<br>Favorite 5 Majikoi girls<br>1. Seiso <br>2. Benkei <br>3. Margit <br>4. Lee <br>5. Momoyo<br><br><br>That she is.<br><br><br>Miyako was a great idea but they shot themselves in the foot with the route, her humor is the best part but sadly that isn't enough for her to be a top tier heroine.<br><br><br>She's a "heroine" for another guy, she's a no go.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That phone call with Frank.<br> blah blah pride of Germany <br> blah blah treat her well </br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, These are my Noble Masters or some such. She's Rens.</br></br>  <br>all of the itagaki were trained quite late but their family is also an unknown, so it's hard to say with Tatsuko, as well as that Tatsuko is a sleepy head who likely does not train nearly as hard as wanko or momoyo, entirely likely shes just one of those odd "potential energy storing" type characters like yajirobe from dragonball, where a lot of their strength comes from being lazy.<br><br><br>Lu is a pretty smart cookie in his own right, he's the sort who paid attention during class so it's likely he understood his training better.<br>it might be possible that if wanko paid attention in biology class about how muscles healed they might get better results instead of overtraining.<br><br><br> shits on miyako but likes MURICA the character <br>I had some pretty serious issues with some stuff in her route but shes great most everywhere else<br>seriously though come on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> start by holding hands </br>  <br>That was the one where Frank advised Yamato to start with handholding since Margit was unaccustomed to romance, right?</br>  <br><br>I said Stacy is a fun character, but her route was pretty bad. They made up for Miyako's terrible route with her S! after story, but you still can't forget how badly that was handled. And at least she got an after route to fix some things, same with Maru getting an after route in A-5.</br></br>  <br> not heroine material <br>You may be right on that.<br>It's sad really, that she just waits and waits like that, at least she has me, I couldn't ask for a better waifu.<br> All the "bad ends" are great though. <br><br><br>Interesting list, everyone as their own opinion, which is fine, but the fact that the votes put these people in front of her is appalling.<br>I'll post my list:<br>1.Miyako<br>2.Mayucchi<br>3.Wanko<br>4.Koyuki<br>5.Benkei<br><br><br> shes just one of those odd "potential energy storing" type characters like yajirobe from dragonball <br>Exactly, it's talent, not hard work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its amusing how much of a Bro Frank was over the subject of Yamato porking Margit compared to how he got over Chris.</br>  <br>The scene where Yamato rationalizes that he should say he likes Maru-san is golden.</br>  <br>Wasn't it pseudo NTR what occured at the end?<br>Margit was always sheltering Chris to the point of being family for her.Fiercely loyal.<br>But then she didn't give a fuck anymore about Chris waking up and just had Yamato's dick in her mind.<br>Gave me quite the feel that Yamato stole her away to some extend in terms of what she prioritizes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> &gt;etc <br>Is this your first exposure to the famous Japanese shit taste?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I won't get tricked <br>IT'S REAL!</br></br>  Is it favourite 5 time?<br><br>1. Wanko<br>2. Momoyo<br>3. Azumi<br>4. Margit<br>5. Lee</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but this is the first time in a while that their shit taste has been this offensive.</br>  <br>Well, he does take quite the overprotective stance when it comes to Chris. I'd say that being a bro is more like his 'real' personality, with his attitude towards anything resembling a threat to his precious little girl being an exception to his general behavior. I think he was also pretty chill in Chris' After route in Majikoi S, having gotten over some of his overprotectiveness.</br>  <br><br>I'm not trying to hate on Miyako, because I really do enjoy her banter with the cast and her primarily as a side character. But comparing her route to all the others even, it just doesn't quite make sense. I know they needed some hook with drama in them eventually, but hers just kind of fell flat. Kind of glad they toned it down a bit in the other routes as time went on, but yeah.</br></br>  <br>Fucking newshits, it's<br>1. Miyako<br>2. Miyako<br>3. Miyako<br>4. Miyako<br>5. Miyako<br>6. SHIT<br>...<br>10000. Miyako</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but the fact that the votes put these people in front of her is appalling. <br><br>The most Miyako has done since S was her normal joke endings (which I must admit are glorious) so Miyako losing to characters that actually have routes is to be expected. Also Miayko hasn't been in the top 10 in a long time.<br><br><br>Frank approves of Yamato so this is to be expected<br><br><br>Throw male characters into that as well<br>1. Yamato<br>2. Hume<br>3. Claudio <br>4. Yoichi<br>5. Shakadou</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. Koyuki<br>2. Yoshitsune<br>3. Mayucchi<br>4. Margit<br>5. Wanko</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm a little sad we didn't get to see a fight between Momoyo and Haou.<br><br>But after everything she learned from Hume, I guess she's even stronger than she becomes in Tsubame's route.</br></br>  <br>I don't think so. She still loved Chris, she was still a loyal German soldier, she just had more in her life than work and Chris. Nobody really lost anything there.</br>  <br>It is now.<br><br>1. Momoyo<br>2. Tatsuko<br>3. Benkei<br>4. Wanko<br>5. Yoshitsune</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats not what it means at all, the itagaki siblings can't be used to prove or disprove anything in this context as their family is unknown, and most of their training is not as far as I am aware, discussed, aside from them using martial arts from kawakami temple, trained by one of the strongest people in the world to the point he has political power.</br>  <br>How does Miyako rank both above and below shit?</br>  <br><br>If we are talking about the boys, for me its:<br><br>1. Hideo<br>2. Gen<br>3. Yamato<br>4. Youchi<br>5.

I'm sorry.<br><br>I don't know how they fucking did it but they did. They really did a series that's 90% composed of best girls. And there are more than thirty of them to boot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Original routes for me are as follows (not counting the prologue and Agave)<br><br>1. Wanko<br>2. Momoyo<br>3. Mayuuchi<br>4. Chris<br>5. Miyako</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Momoyo's route was and still is my favourite. Then it's a toss up of Wanko and Agave. <br>Rest of the routes are basically at the same level except Miyako's, which just bored me.</br></br>  <br><br> They really did a series that's 90% composed of best girls. And there are more than thirty of them to boot. <br><br>I know man. Majikoi is something special when it comes to the girls.<br><br>Making great girls is a speciality of Takahiro. He may not be so great at the actual plots but his characters are often 10/10 material. Its the same case in Akame ga Kill as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1: Literally everyone except Tsubame and Chris<br>2: Chris<br>3: Tsubame</br></br></br>  <br> 1.

Why do you hate Miyako so much compared to Miyako, Miyako, Miyako and Miyako? Why can't you love Miyako, Miyako, Miyako, Miyako and Miyako equally?</br>  <br><br>This, pretty much.<br><br>I wanted to include Capt on mine but his attempting to NTR Yamato in Momo's route is something I still struggle to forgive him for.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Throw in male characters  <br>Alright<br>1.

Well, guess I can't give an opinion because I only played Mayucchi, Chris and currently in middle of Wanko.  I want to spank her until her panties are completely drenched and all she can think about is getting dicked.  <br> Claudio is so damn good in Lee's route, not having him in a top 5 is almost disrespectful <br><br>He instantly went to the top of my list after that route. He really is a great guy.</br></br></br>  <br>As we all know, Miyako is objectively superior to Miyako. Miyako happens to be a far more lovable person than Miyako, and outright dominates Miyako in the hearts and minds of the people. <br>With this established, it is obvious that Miyako is better than Miyako, Miyako, Miyako, Miyako, and Miyako.</br></br>  <br>I like Haguro. She's amusing. Kosugi's, well. To be honest, I kinda enjoyed her "route". She's an idiot, but that's charming in a way. I found Ten funny too, and as for Ami, I kinda wish Yamato could bond with her a bit more. I liked the scene where she and Yamato were hanging up the laundry.</br>  <br>He seems like an asshole in Koyuki's route.</br>  <br>Calm down, Marklar. Every Marklar is equal. Maybe Marklar don't think that because your Marklar is Marklar.</br>  <br> Jun <br><br>I forgot about that glorious bastard.<br><br>Sugita was the fucking perfect VA for him. I am still fucking amazed at the crazy level of VA talent that they were able to get for this game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>to be fair yamato did basically  rape  his daughter<br><br><br>I really didnt like when miyako and miyako teamed up on miyako kicking and punching her into unconciousness</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think her M rank is high enough for that. With Margit and Chris, it would be easy, almost insultingly so, but Kokoro's M rank is still at a novice level.</br>  Shakadou a great. He even got his own April Fools.  <br>Kosugi is a cute baka. She is pretty hateful in Mayu's route, sure but she more than redeemed herself in her mini-route.<br><br>Essentially she just wants praise. She is puppy-esque.</br></br></br>  <br>That laundry scene was her only redeeming factor for me<br><br><br>Lolikyon is best</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meh, she loved it.</br>  <br> as for Ami, I kinda wish Yamato could bond with her a bit more. I liked the scene where she and Yamato were hanging up the laundry. <br>I agree. I think Ami's pretty good when she's being a person rather a dominatrix and nothing more. I wouldn't want there to be an Ami route, but more of some kind of non-sexual friendly interaction with Yamato or other characters would be nice.</br></br>  <br> but her methods were still a little unsightly. <br>Eh, she just used the methods batman uses but I don't see people hating on him.</br></br>    <br>I got this<br><br>1. Kazuko<br>2. Rinchuu<br>3. Seiso<br>4. Chris<br>5. Tsubame<br><br><br>1. Hume<br>2. Oomura<br>3. Frank<br>4. Touma<br>5. Shakadou</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont think Batman does what that post went into quite a lot of detail describing, anon.</br>  <br>Nah Iyo is better in Kosugi's route than Kosugi herself.<br>Kosugi a premium shit.<br><br> Iyo is number 6 on my list of top majikois </br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you play the Agave route and Jun is actually a serious and interesting haracter </br>  How was A-4? I went as far as A-3 with machine translations. But those were a pain to use and is A-4 worth it?  The genji girls are so great.  <br>I'm playing Majikoi and plan to catch up but, did every girl in this post got a route?</br>  <br>He has it pretty together.<br><br>Funny, if Yoichi weren't such a chuuni loner, I feel he and baldy would get along well.</br></br></br>  <br>Yoichi is one of my top 5 characters, for sure.<br>I can't wait to see what he does in the Koyuki route now it's translated.</br></br>  <br>As of right now, no. A few have routes upcoming (Takae, Yoshitsune) and some probably never will (Ageha, Haguro).</br>  <br>How is it possible that the Kuki are so fucking based?<br>Hideo appears at first like an arrogant prick but is actually a godly bro.<br>Ageha lets servants know they are servants, but doesn't look down on them at all.Like Yamato said, she's a positive person by default.<br>Also, those two giving Yamato their blessings with Mon and welcoming him as family was amazing.<br><br>And Mon is just precious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rina Satou makes it all the more better.</br></br>  <br>At that point she already liked him so using Yamato and moving their relationship forward wasn't wrong. She needed every trick in the book to win against Momoyo.</br>  <br>I get the feeling that I am going to fap myself silly with Yoshitsune's H-scenes.<br><br>She is as pure as Wanko but more unintentionally lewd.</br></br></br>  <br>Mon-sama is the only Illya route we'll ever get</br>  <br>Ageha's a heroine of another game, so she'll never have a route.<br><br>As for Haguro, that voice is kind of a major problem. Plus, there seems to be some kinda unwritten rule that all heroines must be virgins, and Haguro blatantly isn't one.</br></br></br>  <br>It'd be nice if they were a tad more connected to Seiso rather than just Senpai-Kouhai</br>  <br>Been lurking and wondering if I need to play this. Hold the fuck on, Rina Satou is in this?</br>  <br>Ageha will probably never happen, since  she's fucking her butler </br>  <br>I bet she's a virgin in Yamato's favourite place.<br> Actually probably not. </br></br>  <br><br>She voices Yoshitsune.</br></br>  <br>Anon, I have been in countless threads where Tsubame fans have attempted to justify her actions.<br><br>They didnt sway me and neither will you. Lets just agree to disagree and nip this argument in the bud.</br></br></br>  They really are best couple.  You know? To be honest?<br><br>I kinda wanted a Student Council President route.</br></br>  <br>What threads? This shit died years ago. I am not trying to convince you you are just wrong.</br>  So, be honest anons.<br>How many fell for Miyako's trap when you had to remain silent instead of picking a choice?</br>  <br>Was she in the anime? My ears are pretty good at picking up my favorite seiyuu, and I don't recall hearing her when I watched Majikoi.</br>  <br> Hideo appears at first like an arrogant prick but is actually a godly bro. <br>Takahiro based him on Gilgamesh from F/SN but specifically didnt include any of the assholish side of Gil in Hideo.<br><br>Hideo is arrogant, sure but its an arrogance that is well founded and justified. He is regal in how he presents himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kokoro in 12th place <br> Not top ten but still very popular <br> No after route <br><br>This pains me more than you know. She'll always be number one in my heart</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are some of the old gg guys working on this translation?</br>  <br><br>No, she wasn't.</br></br>  <br>No, the clones weren't in the anime.</br>  <br>Give it up, anon. I dunno how she does it, but she's had more partners than probably even the every single possible Yamato combined.</br>  <br>No, she wasnt.<br><br> Another anon falling victim to the amazing VA line up that Majikoi has </br></br></br>  <br>Filthy secondary that started to play recently asking. Who is Mon?</br>  <br>Is there even any need to justify her actions? I mean, she's not really a nice person. She's pretty ruthless and unscrupulous. She's also a pretty good match for Yamato and, in a non-romantic way, for Momoyo, and does actually care about both of them. It's possible to be both a good character and a good love interest without being a pure, innocent angel, or even an averagely innocent person.</br>  <br>Every male in the city without a model has been consumed by her infinite lust.</br>  <br>She had a good route. I'm fairly satisfied.<br><br>To be honest, the After routes are kinda among the weaker parts of the VNs anyway. Momoyo's stood out to me in S, but I barely remember most of the others.</br></br></br>  <br>Based on the original Gilgamesh from F/SN before Nasu expanded him**<br><br><br>Monshiro, youngest Kuki sibling</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are entitled to your opinions. But thats all they are, opinions.<br><br><br> "Is there even any need to justify her actions?" <br> then goes on to justify them <br><br>I hope you appreciate the irony here, bro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think she hits people her own age. Most of her victims seem to be college-age. At the very least, it doesn't look like she's fucked anyone in the school.</br>  <br>Loli  illegitimate  daugter of the Kuki family.</br>  <br>I can only remember the pissing h-scenes in Kokoro's route. I really should replay it, im sure its better than how I remember it.</br>    <br> I hope you appreciate the irony here, bro. <br>Are you bad at English or something? I made no attempt of justifying any of her actions. I described her character as I see her, with the intent of explaining why it's possible to like her despite the things she's done.</br></br>  <br> no sandwich <br>this is what ruined her route for me</br></br>  <br>It's no opinions is what happened in the game dude. If you blind yourself in order to hate her than keep being delusional.</br>  <br>It was about Yamato trying to reform Kokoro and make her less of a haughty arrogant bitch and more friendly and respectful towards others. All in order to help her make friends.<br><br>It was pretty good as far as Majikoi goes.</br></br></br>  <br> t's possible to be both a good character and a good love interest without being a pure, innocent angel, or even an averagely innocent person. <br><br>Sure it is.<br><br>However I still dont like her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>H-scenes weren't really the strongest part of that route. Kokoro starting to behave like a person worth talking to was the main attraction of it.</br>  <br>Dem diabetes. It's coming back. Along with the pain of not knowing moon.<br><br>Also, Hideo a hero.</br></br></br>  <br>1. Kokoro<br>2. Wanko<br>3. Yoshitsune<br>4. Miyako<br>5. Lee</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hfw cucked <br> by her mom </br></br>  <br> only my favourable inturpretation about mai waifu is the correct one!!! <br><br>And you see why I wanted to nip this shit in the bud?</br></br></br>  <br>Chris' after route might as well be non-existent.<br>I was just hoping Margit would give in to another threesome as she obviously wanted a go with Yamato.<br>I guess she got her own route though.</br></br></br>  <br> the deadness in those eyes from such a betrayal </br>  <br> There will never be a Milf Majikoi scene </br>  <br>Her mom was so hot.</br>  <br> mfw her Mom is a lot more attractive than Tsubame herself <br><br>I'd be worried if I was Tsubame as well.</br></br></br>  <br>It's still amazing how insanely wide Yamato's strike zone is. Is there anyone who doesn't get him rock hard?<br><br>He'd probably even fall for Hidemi if the conditions were right. Though it's not as if Hidemi's unattractive, either.</br></br></br>  <br> mfw it leads to bad end </br>  <br>At least the older women get dicked, like sensei.</br>  <br> However I still dont like her. <br>And I can definitely understand that. I merely wanted to explain why I, personally, like her  in the future where Yamato takes the lead. </br></br>  <br>Takuya route when?<br> Or Touma </br></br>  <br><br>Maybe i'll just keep learning moon.</br></br>  <br>Kusanagi dicks all even the men. I really enjoyed Yamato.</br>  <br> It's still amazing how insanely wide Yamato's strike zone is. Is there anyone who doesn't get him rock hard? <br><br>To be fair to him, his attraction to Mon only happened in her route. He doesnt normaly go for that sort of thing, Mon just brought it out of him.</br></br></br>  <br>Yamato decided not to do that anymore. He probably wouldn't even if they both demanded it. <br><br>He generally sticks to his guns.<br><br>Well, it's a good trait to have. He won't get stabbed in the back like that one friend of his, anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chance was wasted when Kagekiyo ordered Saki to get naked in the park.</br>  Just started the first game. Is a walk-through recommended the first go-around?  <br> Moro <br><br>You can't. He and Gakuto are already promised to each other.</br></br></br>  <br>It's impossible to fuck up in this game. Just follow your dick</br>  <br>Miyako pls</br>  <br>Well, he did get hard when he saw her naked, but I guess that sort of thing's normal. Once a girl reaches a certain age, hormones will force a man into rising even if he doesn't necessarily want to.</br>  <br>It would probably be a good idea on Momoyo's route since it's pretty much the only one you can possibly fuck up without being a complete idiot.</br>  <br>In no order, and only with translated routes:<br>Mayu<br>Kokoro<br>Wanko<br>Monshiro<br>Tsubame</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Gakuto.<br>One would think he'd get Chika in the Agave route.He fucking deserves her and in reverse.</br></br>  <br><br>Momoyo is the only route you can really mess yourself up in, but for that you could just savescum it till it basically says you picked the right choice.<br><br>The rest is just simple.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, okay. The way the tutorial described the personal ability thing made it seem like I could have routes closed off if I fuck up unknowingly.</br>  <br> Takuyo-chan route <br>I approve.</br></br>  <br> walkthrough for a VN <br>fuck is wrong with you</br></br>  <br> is pretty much right, unless you try for Momoyo while being Rito.</br>  <br>Well you can get locked into routes, but one you're in it doesn't really matter.</br>  <br><br>Eh? Really? When? Where? How?</br></br>  <br>No guide needed.<br><br>Momo's route is the only one where you actions have consequences i.e. getting the good end or bad end.<br><br>However, to get the bad end you really need to have gone out of your way to treat Momo like complete shit.<br><br>Protip: Catch the fucking blue fish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Benkei<br>Miyako<br>Kokoro<br>Margit<br>Iyo<br><br> Everyone Majikoi is bestkoi </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you fail Momoyo's route, uninstall<br>You dont deserve to be Yamato</br></br>  <br> Mon just brought it out of him. <br>Friendly reminder that if you ignore the age bullshit then Monshiro is around 14</br></br>  <br>You can miss some options and fail to win her heart at the end.</br>  <br>Gotta be careful of that timed event.<br>Not sure what happens at the end if you fuck up catching the fish, but Momoyo has it in S so I guess it's crucial?</br></br>  Wanko a best  <br>Wasn't there a scene in S where he basically went "Did you fall for me? Huh?" when Chika thanked him again for his actions, kind of freaking her out and prompting one of the other characters to note that he might've actually had a chance if he didn't get so overeager? He kind of sabotages himself every time he could make some kind of romantic progress with anyone.</br>  <br>By not catching the fish.</br>  <br>This surprisebox is correct.</br>  <br>There's more to it than that</br>  <br>Really? I didn't know that. <br><br><br>Oh, right, you have to catch the fish, don't you? It completely slipped my mind that it was a choice event so I forgot all about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>Momo's route is about being as Alpha as is physically possible. <br><br>Chose the best options you are given (they are obvious and often hilarious) and you cant fail.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You can miss the fish if you get all the test questions right.</br>  <br>THE MEMES, JACK</br>  <br>Gakuto has the person/a/lity.</br>  <br>She is certainly olev, trips-san</br>  I wonder of Momoyo gets a power-up by being in a relationship with Yamato. Like, the power of love gives her +50 in all stats or something.<br><br>It'd be kinda funny if Momoyo's at her strongest in a route where she never gets to meet or fight monsters like Tsubame and Hume.</br></br>  <br> you will never have a Wanko of your very own <br><br>Just kill me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>10/10 would adopt as a pet<br>I just can't see her as anything but pure little Wanko</br></br></br>  <br>Wanko is Saten confirmed.</br>  <br> It'd be kinda funny if Momoyo's at her strongest in a route <br>what<br><br> Like, the power of love gives her +50 in all stats or something. <br>Anon, you can't +50 infinity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yamato's semen is known to have performance-enhancing qualities. See: Miyako.</br>  <br>Stronger, maybe not. <br>More versatile? Maybe. She learns about using martial arts to heal others after  the fish gets sick and Lu heals it. </br></br>  <br><br>Momo getting the D mellows her out anon, not the other way around.</br></br>  <br>I thought that way in Majikoi, but in S her sex scenes and romantic scenes were surprisingly natural.</br>  <br><br>Because its giving her a release valve. <br><br>She was getting horribly restless and unfocused when the only thing she had to look forward to was an equal fight that would never come. Now that she's routinely getting Sword of Kusanagi at full force to the ass mouth and vagina she can release stress in a healthy way. <br><br>have you ever studied for a test so hard that you exhaust yourself when it finally comes time to take the test? Its like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not in her case I dont think. <br>For other girls it's a confidence boost, but he more or less reels in momoyo</br></br>  <br>Momoyo will always be at the top no one can match her and if they do she will grow to outmatch them.

Isolation could be fine if Japan controls all the Unobtainum in the world.</br>  <br> Japan refused to surrender unconditionally, America decided to make an example out of them to Russia. <br>No, it happened because Russia was lying to Japan about being their middleman to negotiate a surrender with the USA, the latter never heard that Japan was trying to reach them through the soviets. <br>Russia declared war on Japan after the first nuke hit in order to get as much land as possible after the chaos it generated so if it was to make an example out of them to Russia, it had the complete opposite effect making them try to capitalize on that opportunity instead. <br><br>Japan was salty as fuck about that enough to still be at war with Russia to this day, they never signed a peace treaty with them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bozes</br>  <br>That is cool as shit</br>    <br>Seconded</br>  <br><br>Best Gate</br></br>  <br>Dick wants the elf.<br>Heart wants the mage. <br>Not sure what but some part me wants the Rory.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Vauban was one hell of an engineer.<br><br>His forts were still in use in 1916.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douau<wbr>mont</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>soul</br>  <br> Dick wants the elf </br>  Haha, I get it!

Lets say Japan moves to the Special Region, blows up the gate, and conquers the entire fantasy world. Now what? The value of the unobtanium is constrained by the limits of the Special Region free market, which is limited because most civilizations there use sticks and stones. So its traded and hoarded by the Japanese themselves. That means they're just sitting on a bunch of rocks that are of no particular use to anyone other than themselves.<br><br>Then they start squabbling over the worth of the rocks. Then they fight each other over who will own the rocks. Then they systematically regress through constant turmoil because there is no stronger threat or impetus to unite the people. And then when all is said and done, there will be a new era of peoples sitting on their own stacks of rocks. Good fucking job, it obviously wasn't worth the effort.<br><br>And that is without going into whether or not there are rocks in the Special Region worth using. For all the magic and dragons and super scythes available, the mere presence of modern technological and sciences makes these things look useless.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> This is a Japanese cleric. </br></br>  Who was that president fellow talking about moving half of his population to the special region?  <br>Expand Dong is China's president</br>  <br>I beg to differ.</br>  <br><br>His name is Emi Gration Chang.</br></br>  <br><br><br>All of me wants the Rory.</br></br></br>  <br>That depends what Unobtanium does.

Plus, they hate eachother. The only way the Japanese might go along with that is if it was the only way to stop an iminient war with China they didn't think they could win, in order to achieve Peace In Their Time. But we all know how that goes.<br><br>In other news, what the hell is up with the Star Fort? We've seen no evidence of cannons, which is what those were intended to defend against, so all it accomplishes is increasing the amount of perimeter per area, which just drives up costs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>1.

The point of trade is interaction. Take the development of rocket science for example. There are a lot of uses for rocket sciences, but each nation and trading partner applies it towards a different nationalistic goal. Eventually, that overall progress of rocket science diffuses across the spectrum so that everyone can eventually benefit.<br><br>Another example is the oil economy. In a very basic sense, the Middle East gains nothing by hoarding the oil all to themselves. They stand to benefit far more if they sell the oil to everyone, albeit with market regulations to make sure they still gain the most benefits. Hoarding the Special Region and its resources is harmful to the national interest. And practicing the isolation dream in it is purely self destructive. By going down that road, the offender closes off one path full of known factors and variables and opens up another path of unknown factors at best, or a path with limited to no choices at worst.</br></br></br></br>  <br> why star fort <br>Simple. The locals don't have aircraft, which means they have to use a ground forces to take the hill. A fort that's hard to get into by land and leaves nowhere for an enemy ground force to hide is a very well thought out design against that.<br><br> drives up cost <br>Short term loss, long term gain. Remember they see the other world as a land of gold, milk, honey, and sexy bunny girls.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why did they get rid of the older refugees? It felt weird just having the main three girls there all the time. I mean, I get it. We know they're important, but don't shove them in peoples faces.  <br>Agreed on the Pearl Harbor part.

The mail wasn't quite so reliable back then.</br>    <br> Agreed on the Pearl Harbor part. It was a surprise attack. <br>Except that it wasn't. America fueled both sides of the war and when it saw one side losing it cut off needed oil which would force japs to attack and they even knew it was going to happen according to declassified memos. This would send Amerikkka into a patriotic fervor and boost the terrible economy which is what the Govt was aiming for.</br></br>  <br> cheeki breeki.webm <br>I love you anon.</br></br>  <br> elfs are fast to detect lewdness </br>  I'm a bit disappointed they didn't have the legend of the Rod.  <br> CHING CHONG WITU PIGGU <br> goddamn commies <br> A NU CHEEKI BREEKI </br></br></br>  <br>Chang?</br>  <br>Oh.

Before Pearl Harbor, America considered itself on good relations in Japan and tried all diplomatic avenues to stop Japan's increasingly chaotic military campaign in Manchuria and the people were reluctant to go to war over it. After Pearl Harbor, Japan was going to burn in hell.<br><br><br><br>That is some /pol/ tier garbage. Japan wanted its own empire long before that happened. But lets just pretend the League of Nations never happened or how America was secretly planning to conquer Japan. The West was trying to stop Japan diplomatically and economically because of the viciousness of their campaign. They were using Western goods to turn China into a killing field. And instead, the Japanese turned the goods back on the West - because they wanted their own little empire when everyone else was already done with the idea.<br><br><br><br>Go read a fucking book.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  big boss is still my favourite character  <br><br>Why?

Not that they were bad, but that threw me off.</br>  <br>Didn't stop me from dropping it.<br>There's not a single character I liked in that show.</br></br>  <br> military protection from other countries <br><br>Cold War 2.0 started at the moment they realized the immense opportunities the special region offers, the only way the US can protect them is by making Japan their Cuba this time around and stuff it to the brim with nuclear warheads.<br><br>In all honesty, I can't think of how this story would have a happy ending at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was just a wish on the Chinese president's part. <br><br>But that and the speech about whither the other world was worth going against the rest of the earth just shows that the politics in this story are the least plausible thing in it. Japan vs the rest of the world would last a couple of days at the most and most of that would be giving them time to surrender. The only way that makes sense is if the government is thinking of going through the gate with most of the military and closing it somehow behind them.</br></br></br>  So I just finished the last Naruto movie and saw the trailer Boruto : naruto the movie.<br><br>Honestly I have no fucking idea what I think of this... thoughts?</br></br>  trailer for those that havn't seen it : https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qyo<wbr>nn5Vbg7s</wbr>  [ ]  Fuck off.  go back to school  Is boruto a girl?  <br>I'm sorry, you just missed the thread <br><br>To answer your question: I just watched The last yesterday too, I'll stay away from Naruto for now, it was such a well done ending, I don't want it to get ruined.</br></br></br>  <br>boy, the girl is Himawari http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Himawa<wbr>ri_Uzumaki</wbr></br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  <br>Yes</br>   another thread already <br><br>Glad to see the mod not enforcing what he said.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br> le hating on narutu is cool <br><br>It's been common on /a/ since 2004, just deal with it you autists.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Naruto is shit, but I watched the last for Hinata getting her man finally. It was still pretty shit how it went down. Naruto remembers her saying she loves him and would die for him and then thinks "oh that means she likes me"  <br>Why are you mad friend?</br>  <br>Don't you have summer school to go to kid?</br>  <br><br>Your life must be pretty sad if you're just trolling /a/ narutu threads, but whatever.<br><br>Contribute or GTFO.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he were to enforce what he said then he would have to delete 90% of the content on /a/.</br>  <br>To be fair he never had a family or anything of the sort to pick up basic social cues from, and spent the majority of his life, even at that point, as the village pariah shunned and feared by adults and avoided by their children to presume that the less positive implication is true.<br>Still retarded, by all means, and if I were to make that sort of a story that's not the route I'd go, but for the standards of this manga it is both feasible and fairly good.</br></br>  <br>"Daisuki" can mean "I love you" or "I really like you." In fact, Kakashi says "I really like you!" to Naruto, who interprets it as Kakashi hitting on him, before Kakashi clarifies.</br>  fuck off  <br>/a/ is dead</br>  <br>But then Naruto himself uses 'suki' in his own, accidental, confession.<br>It's not that good an idea to expect the series to make much sense or have consistency.</br></br>  New page, niggers.<br><br> ããã­ããã«ãããµã©ã <br> Sarada, Boruto, Mitsuki <br> æ°æä»£ <br> Next generation <br> ä¸äººä¸çµ!! <br> Three-Man-Cell!! <br> ã©ããªä»»åãããã¼ã ã£ã¦ã°ãï¼ï¼ <br> Boruto: No matter the mission, I even have &gt;spare time(/it's easy) âdattebasa!! <br> ãªãã¡ãã ããï¼ï¼ãã«ãã«ãï¼ï¼ <br> Sarada: Donât mess around!!

Hell, come to think of it, we have a similar distinction that would make a confession like the one Hinata made possible to misinterpret on the 'I like you/I love you' grounds. It would still take a fucking retard, given the context, to misinterpret it, but if it works in any way similar to the Nips, I can sort of see it happening.</br></br>  <br><br>Every anime is literally misunderstandings</br></br>  <br>Best family.</br>  Fuck off, narutards.  <br>Why do you think they're dying out?</br>  Boruto?

Naruto and his gen are just another pillar on the ladder, and the next generation will keep going from there.<br><br>He paved the way that a lot of generations before him have been aiming for all this time, but its still nothing like Jesus came down and solved everything. The world keeps going, history tends to keep going, Naruto's generation are just another one much like Jiraiya's generation or Kakashi's.<br><br>Boruto is meant to really demonstrate this theme in certain ways; the respect for the older generation, but at the same time its not just all about them and that was the climax of it all, time keeps moving forward.<br><br>The new will succeed the old, but they must never forget what they were taught by them either.<br><br>Its a story that was in the works before the manga ended, as Kishi's real end to the series. Although "The Last" movie was the end of Naruto really, and the new movie is the beginning of "Boruto". As if to give us hope that it just keeps going and progressing forward, even if we don't see their journey from here on.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128539382#p128545205">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Restarting the dump of the new prison school chapter.<br>Restarting from here<br/></br>  <br>thank you.</br>  <br>Based</br>  <br> ready <br> set... <br><br>Uhh, maybe "battle" might not have been the best translation. I'm gonna change it to "struggle"(?) from here on out. If any other korean bro wants to provide a better word, please feel free to change it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> St- struggle? <br> That's right... Last year during the obstacle course, two people used violence during the competition. <br> At the end of the fight, even though Hana-senpai ended up winning. <br> After the competition, they both ended up being taken away in an ambulance. <br> WHAT!? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Translating gakuto's thing is weird. I dunno if it's my lack of korean prowess or the way he talks but it's funky.<br> My god... fighting with power to influence the cavalry battle... <br> At the first obstacle, ahead of the pack, Hana-senpai and Risa-san arrive at the same time... <br> No! Hana-senpai is barely faster!! <br> Up to here, it's matching last year's record. <br>I'm not really sure how to translate what Risa is saying here. But I think this is correct:<br> Oops, my body is stumbl- <br> ing! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rei or Asuka?  <br><br> it happened again </br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>1. That was Episode 25<br>2. If you pay attention Episode 25 is just regurgitating Episode 6.</br></br></br>  <br>By that logic, all Reifags are shit too. Good work, we're done here.</br>  <br>Why are you greentexting?</br>  bootleg thread    <br>Is that a spinoff of dead or alive?</br>      The classic Sader  Prove that Megumi is not the best girl. <br><br>Hint:  you can't. </br></br>  <br>The only shit I see in that pic is on the left.</br>  <br> stating the truth is somehow shitposting now. <br>Sorry, I didnt know that.</br></br>  <br><br>You're blind, anon.</br></br>  <br>You sure told him! <br>megumifags lack individuality just like their shitty waifu.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't need an extravagant hairstyle, accessories or a rainbow hair color to be beautiful.</br>  Ok /a/ I just finished watching Oreimo. Now I can understand the OP from the last thread still being mad as shit.  Kyosuke rejecting all the girls and breaking social norm just to be "lovers for a limited time" and "enjoy themselves to the fullest" (which by the way never get to see) until both graduate? Then we get one kiss and they break up?  What the actual fuck? The ending was really unsatisfactory and I'm buttmad. The only thing that relieved some butthurt is this trivia from the wiki  Based off of the interviews with the author, it seems that Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship with each other truly has not ended. <br><br>-----------------------------------<wbr>-------------------------<br><br>Some minor questions the LN- and Mangafags maybe able to solve:<br><br>S02E08:  Kyosuke is wounded for some reason and being treated by Kirino. How did that happen? <br><br>S02E12:  Ayase goes back home from Kyousuke's apartment and someone takes photos of her? What was that about? <br><br> Why was Kanako part of his harem? They rarely interacted together and I never saw any hints? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Branch out into other incest anime. Try Yosuga no Sora and Mahouka, avoid Kissxsis though it's a lie</br>  <br><br>Oreimo anime is really not that good, the last part of S2 is actually cringeworthy.<br><br>Harem subplot almost killed the story for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I heard Koi Kaze was good too. Will look into, thank anon<br><br><br> I actually liked S2 and thought the harem subplot was funny </br></br></br></br>  <br>kek<br>green inbred flipper baby</br></br>  Would it be safe for Kirino and Kyousuke to have a boy and girl in that order? The imouto would be at risk from her parents and onii-chan, no?</blockquote>]
