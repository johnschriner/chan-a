I don't really play VNs so that and Wanko are all I know.</br>  <br><br> Are we allowed to talk about that game now? <br>Still not allowed.  Maybe late at night, though  but since it is western, it isnt allowed on /a/. And since it immediately causes shitposting and people bringing up the false rumors surrounding the game whenever its posted, its not really allowed on other boards either. <br>Theres really nothing wrong with the game itself, its just that the response to the game causes shitposting and mods delete it early as a precaution.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Amazingly i did everything right on my first playthrough.   only died twice out of curiousity to see what would happen </br>  <br> and people bringing up the false rumors surrounding the game <br>?</br></br>  <br> false rumors <br><br>Played the game, had fun, understand why it would really be allowed on /a/ (VN and western), never heard any rumors though.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you talking about the borrowed designs for the girls and other characters?</br>  <br><br><br>The popular thing for normalfags to say on  /v/  is that it was "traced". Anyone whos actually played the game knows its false though. This rumor is a bastardization of the original rumor which was certain characters were loosely inspired by existing people, which is true to some degree, but nothing criminal.</br></br></br>  <br>*inspired.</br>  How to deal with lolis like these ?  <br>most of them   have a single loli heroine[/code] </br>  <br>Not really a photoshop wizard, but I tried.

So all you are doing in complaining, is complaining about yourself having the freedom (the option) to enjoy something. <br><br>"Excuse me, my cage is too small, can you make it a bit smaller? thanks!" - You<br><br>Complaining about artistic works, is an example of someone who is so unbelievably cucked, that he must create new ways to limit himself, shelter himself, unwittingly enabling the people who control him to continue to have more exclusivity within higher status.<br><br>"why is this allowed" is another way of saying "why am I allowed to see this?" Are you an idiot child who needs a parent constantly monitoring you? Do you seriously think things like drawings need to be "allowed" or "disallowed" by someone? Do you want everything you do or eat or watch or read to be "allowed" or approved to exist? Do you have no idea how much of a human shit-stain you have become? <br><br>Fuck you, sir.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      hello lolicons<br>please rip and upload October 10 2014 up until the latest release please ;_;<br><br>http://www.dlsite.com/maniax/circle<wbr>/profile/=/maker_id/RG06438.html</wbr></br></br></br>    <br> SFX: Chubby chubby <br><br>Heh</br></br></br>  <br>Not with that attitude you wont</br>      <br> /z/ <br>My brother, how you remember so poorly.</br></br>    <br>Sim loli dev is truly a hard working fellow.</br>  <br>LO is a compilation of older men having sex with elementary school girls, varying from fetish to rape.<br><br>Shit is fucked up.<br><br>And that is a shop you idiot, you really think Backham would be reading pedo shit in public?<br><br>He was reading Jump something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if by that you mean "made a proof of concept and might get back to working on it next week" continuous prioritized development it is not.</br>  <br>Loli is awake!</br>  Shh, loli is sharting.  <br>Let's go get some ice cream, loli.</br>  <br> Shit is fucked up. <br> drawings <br> fucked up <br><br>Someone, somewhere is imagining something offensive! can you feel it! oh my god!

Even if it was a Japanese name I'd still think it was off. Lineart and shading look weird.</br>  <br>And the noses too. I still say he's pretty good for a  black?  western guy.</br>  <br>Wouldnt it be great though if, someday western artists become competent enough to start their own doujinshi scene? Where they produce manga of similar or equal quality to the japanese? Maybe the newer generations will do it, ive been seeing a lot of really competent western arts in the past 10 years, some can do a japanese style perfectly. I hope that, someday american artists will, instead of conform to the current market and try to be concept artists etc, they try to make their own way.</br>  <br>I'm sure that will happen the second that Japan conquers the USA.</br>  <br>japan is already conquering the US via the internet.<br>almost everyone who isnt 40 or 50 years old has grown up watching some kind of weaboo shit.</br></br>  The Jews fear the Samurai tbh lads  <br> tbh lads <br><br>I swear to fucking god if I see another "tbh" or "lads" again im going to fucking kill myself. fuck that shitty meme.</br></br></br>    <br>Getting upset and killing yourself over a meme? <br><br>Have you even been here longer than 6 months?</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, after you actually learn your fundamentals it's pretty easy to choose the complete direction of your style, but like<br> said there is no big market for complete manga art, most people who commission western artists are half normalfags that<br>dwell on tumblr and prefer the half western shit, so usually we just get dedicated hobbyists.<br><br><br>There actually was a try for a manga magazine in the us i think, but they got under pretty fast, they had shit artists from what i hear though,<br>if you go to places like /ic/ though, from time to time although rarely you will find pretty amazing western artists that go for faithful manga style,<br>the worst thing right now is the market, there is absolutely no way to sell your doujins in the west, there is only the english DLsite but it requires heavy<br>censorship, i am pretty sure the in the next decades we are going to start seeing more of it tough. This guy is pretty good at manga style, he posts on /ic/<br>from time to time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/pol/ please  stay  I like your crazy shit. Reminds of hippies.<br><br>What about fam, fam?</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad a bunch of actual mangaka use tumblr too so I can't just block the site.</br>  <br>I would recommend any respected artist not to use it since it's the epitome of a censorship happy websites, although i can see why it's very alluring not to do so.</br>  <br> i am pretty sure the in the next decades we are going to start seeing more of it tough. This guy is pretty good at manga style, he posts on /ic/ <br>give it maybe 20 years or so, and reading manga will be as normal as reading anything else. There are already little kids growing up reading manga and there are already adults who grew up reading manga who now have teenage kids. Its becoming relatively normalized and stigmatized. once that happens fully, we'll see more compotent western artists emerge, even if its in fan markets or relatively un-official type sales, it will still happen eventually. Kind of sucks we'll be old when it finally happens though.</br></br>  <br>God i absolutely love Ham's artwork.</br>  <br>I feel as if I've seen that girl that's making double peace signs before.

That one's really not as easy as the first one since there's no gap between the characters that you can exploit to stretch the image. This is 16:9 and the simplest way would be to redraw Misaki's arm here, but that would leave a large unsymmetric gap and I'm not good enough to redraw half of Haruka.</br>  <br>I figured that might have been the case, it might work when the logo is in the gap?</br>  <br>What logo? The colored speech bubble?</br>  <br>This one, though on second look, I'm starting to doubt it somewhat</br>  <br>I'm an idiot, copied image location rather than link</br>  <br>Haruka would be my first pick.

I'll still try something else.</br>  <br>Voted for Teru.</br>  <br>Either Kanade or Haruka, they look like they could be fitting rulers.</br>  <br> 5689x3200 <br>damm</br></br>  DOUJINS WHEN?  Thanks anon, that looks awesome  <br>Concerned citizen would vote for best boy Shu, fuck the moeblob lolis.</br>  <br>Poor Misaki, Haruka wants dem Akanes hard.</br>  <br>Man they look so different from that prologue.</br>  <br>My brain says Shuu, mu dick says Misaki.</br>  <br> not voting for Kanade who can solve the world's problems by literally wishing for it <br> not voting for Aoi who has a Geass <br>Shuu maybe dependable but his power isn't good for running a country</br></br></br>  <br>Ask your heart now.</br>  <br>Kanade can't do what you say though<br>Fixing all the world's problems would be expensive even for her</br></br>  <br>My heart is a republican.</br>  Can someone remind me why Kanade can't get around her money issue by printing money and simply keeping it stored without letting it enter circulation?  <br>It's magic in the first place so maybe the magic also knows the money isn't legit.</br>  <br>That would be like using monopoly money. And it has to be in her bank account.</br>  <br> Votes for Shuu <br>Is it wrong that I want Shuu to protect me like he protect his sisters?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Stop voting for a cripple who already has enough on his plate.</br>  <br><br>But why can't the federal mint just create more money to direct transfer to her account, in exchange for her materialising things of equal worth?<br><br>She would boost the nation's resources without damaging the value of its currency.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that Aika and Souji turned into kid?</br>  <br>Why doesn't she just, like, buy more money?</br>  <br>n-no</br>   Powers that can be used to reverse entropy, which will thus be the most useful powers for humanity once immortality is discovered: <br> Teleport <br> Antigravity <br> Materialization <br> Super Strength <br><br>Questionable:<br> Organic manipulation (Temporary) <br> Splitting (Very small scale) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying that they only do non-suggestive?</br>  <br>The money probably enters circulation after she creates her stuff.</br>  <br>But that raises many more questions.<br>Where does it appear?<br>If it goes to the owner of the item materialised, or the company/craftsman that was capable of making the item, then what if she materialises something that wouldn't have any human origin?</br></br></br>  <br>Well I guess she has to pay gods or alien then.</br>  <br>When she creates something, she's literally stealing the resources for it from someone/somewhere. The only thing that makes it not stealing is that magically that someone/somewhere gets an amount of money equivalent to what she took.</br>  <br>But when she doesn't have enough money  things she's already materialised vanish, that doesn't quite fit with what you said, unless the resources were nicked from the same place </br>  <br>Well that's because  magic, ain't gonna bother explaining this shit </br>  <br>It actually is.</br>   doki   <br>I know, it's when Aika gets sent to the past and makes shota souji love twintails. But still, same artist so it all looks similar enough.<br><br> Why is Aika so perfect? </br></br></br>  <br>I know, don't want to complain because I know how much effort fansubbing is, but still.<br><br>So much for their schedule</br></br></br>  <br>Flatness+Violence  And her pure love for Souji. </br>  <br>wow misaki is a fucking commie</br>  <br><br>It's the same every season, they start doing well and suddenly the fall back a fuckload. It's like they had Jing doing the editing, except their editor sucks but still disappears and stalls everything</br></br>  <br>So Teru is the best choice then.</br>  <br>Based on that, Shuu or Shiori (only from her view) gets my vote</br>  I want to  defile   Aoi.  <br>Too late.</br>  <br>I wonder if Aoi sometimes feels left out because none of her siblings are lusting after her.</br>  <br>Probably.</br>  <br>It's the same editor as Re-kan was too, so they'll probably fall behind a little more and then catch up</br>  <br>She's probably secretly the source of all the lust for family members going on with her geass.</br>  <br>If Aoi told you to shove dildos inside you while you're crying for help, would she be raping you or would you be raping yourself?</br>  <br>We need to do some research over here.</br>  <br>No one. They all look incompetent.</br>  <br>Aoi looks pretty good.</br>  <br>Since none of the relevant chapters are translated, I really have no idea about the extent of her true power.<br><br>I wonder if she could make you hard and cum on command, or make girls' panties wet just by walking up to them from behind and whispering in their ear.<br><br>Or if she could make people believe or forget things, implant triggers into them, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shirt <br> necktie <br> dat healthy <br>dayum</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget the spats.<br><br><br>I don't think she'd need the power for hard on command or making panties wet</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone said her power was basically Lelouch's except with none of the downsides his power had.</br>  <br>shuu will make a comeback to stop arranged marriages and take satou as her queen, good end.</br>  <br> as her queen <br> her </br></br>  <br> Shuu, Satou and Aoi are all supporting Akane. Misaki and Hikari are supporting Haruka.  </br>  <br>There's one chapter where she stopped an armed robbery through commanding the robbers, then commanded all the witnesses to forget about what they just saw.<br>The other possible usage (I would assume which made her fear her own power) is that one time she asked three girls to be her friend when she was young and unaware of her power. When she realized her own power she started to question how genuine her friendships are.</br></br>  <br>Were the BDs for that any good? I only caught a glimpse of the first volume and it looked pretty bad.</br>  <br>I just noticed that part of Misaki's hair is missing. Fixed it here.</br>  <br>Look up on fapservice.com</br>  <br>But who is on Teru's side?</br>  <br> Facing the screen towards the door in a house of 11 people <br><br>How could you do such a thing Haruka? Don't you know the probability of Akane seeing what you're looking at?</br></br></br>  Is anyone working on the manga of this?  <br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=79085<br>You could at least try first</br></wbr></br>  <br>Then I guess even if she ran for king, she couldn't be sure if the people voted for her because they wanted to or because she'd once slip and say something like ".. . so please vote for me!"<br><br>As far as powers go, hers might be the most useful right before Shuu's.</br></br></br>  <br> Don't do those things by yourself in our room! </br>  <br>God, I want to vote for Misaki so badly.</br>  <br>Just got to be careful and pepper all the statements with qualifiers like "If you truly believe I'm the best choice..." and such</br>  <br> You scared your older sister you dirty boy </br>  <br>Vote for Haruka then. That is where her support has gone.</br>  <br>Did that group officially pick up the manga?<br><br>They only released like 6 chapters and it says "Request"</br></br></br>  <br>What's Haruka looking in the internet? An Akane Thread?</br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br>I hope Misaki can win him over.</br>  <br> Request from AKP47. <br>So I assume they're doing it on his request but it's still picked up.</br></br>  <br><br> tfw you're brother is ferocious and passionate with you're sister </br></br>  Does anyone know of sources for scans of chapters past volume 2? Can't find individual chapter scans for the series and can't find mag scans of anything but a few from last year.  <br>Could also be a few commissioned chapters, I don't want to get my hopes up to have them crushed later.<br><br>That's why I was looking to see if the group officially picked it up. The person working on them might browse /a/ too.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, the first post didn't come across quite like that, sorry for being a dick</br>  <br> sorry for being a dick <br>Back to &gt;&gt;&gt;/plebbit/ with that attitude</br></br>  <br> criminal scum </br>  <br>Who in her family knows about her real power?</br>  <br>Her Dad and some royal staff.</br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>I bet Misaki is jelly as fuck.</br>  <br>Someone should get the current group to use digital raws instead.

I used to find it obnoxious when the camera panned over the chest and crotch for some designated money shots, but unless you have some laughable notion that fiction needs to be reformed to more respectfully represent real people, then I don't see how it really detracts from the show. Especially if the show in question is not valued for it's strong narrative in the first place. I just take it for what it is and move on.</br>   there are people in 4chan who are unironically feminists <br>Cancer killing the internet, go fuck yourselves</br>   complaining about shitty fanservice is being feminist <br>You do realise half of the shows you watch are feminist as fuck?<br>Just remember how many times you've seen girl beating guys, girl being the most strong and the most smart etc.</br></br>  /a/- Feminism &amp; Pornography.  <br>Go and be a faggot somewhere else.</br>  <br>Fuck off back to Tumblr.</br>  <br> implying women are pure <br>We live in a day and age where not losing your virginity by the age of 12 is uncommon.</br></br>  <br> Berserk series remake with proper animation studio and no removal of important content <br> Gantz remake following the entire manga with the removal of vampire shit <br> Blade Dance S2 <br> Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun S2 <br> Trigun remake following manga content <br> Kubo goes back to the end of the SS arc and rewrites the whole series from there realizing he fucked up bad <br> instead of doing fillers Naruto would just get high quality recreations of the earlier 1-135 skipping filler <br> NGNL S2 <br><br>I know there's a lot of shit eating in there but whatever, the shit eating series are where I have discontent that could actually be fixed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> at the end of the season the background character is revealed to be the big bad of all the series and three movies are made crossing together all of the shows that aired that season. </br>  <br> You do realise half of the shows you watch are feminist as fuck? <br><br>No they're not. I'm surprised that feminists are even able to deal with the cognitive dissonance of opposing 'damaging' portrayals of women in fiction whilst at the same time defending anime with female casts that are designed to appeal to different varieties of fetishists<br><br>Just having girls that kick ass is not enough for most feminists as they're usually fussing over how sexually objectifying fictional women, or treating them in a way that is not fully empowered is hurtful to real women and reinforces the non-existent patriarchy. That justifies it being reformed in their eyes.<br><br>Thank God Japan doesn't care about feminism nearly as much as the West does, otherwise they'd be all over anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A proper G.I. Joe anime</br>   An entire season airs (35 +shows) and every single show is SoL with an all-female cast   <br>But what about traps?</br>  <br>Fuck off trapfag, stop trying to interject your bad taste into everything.</br>  <br>I like traps and I like all girls shit, but I don't think they'd mix well.</br>  A show where each episode has a higher budget than the last.  <br>All the remaining monogatari novels getting animeted and relased one episode a day</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure kaiji is not an anime season</br>  In the vein of pic related, let me try my turn:<br><br><br>No, women are not fucking "pure" if you define "purity" as "not having sexual feelings."<br><br>And on the other hand, both women and men would be naturally "pure" in the sense that they would not be obsessively perverted sick fucks if they didn't grow up in cultures where sex is 1) firstly repressed, and 2) then encouraged to explode out again from said repression in absolutely retarded ways.<br><br>To elaborate on point 2, for men it's encouraged to explode in the form of turning into a quasi-rapist, and for women it's encouraged to explode in the form of turning into an ever cock-craving slut.<br><br>Being a rapist at the very least puts you in a position of power, whereas being an ever cock-craving slut basically means you're a filthy masochist who deserves to be fucked senseless non-stop. Add to that the facts that 1) fucking means for women that an orifice of theirs gets penetrated which is an intrusive feeling, 2) this penetration isn't even their prime method of sexual stimulation (careful clit-massaging is), and 3) women have biologically lower sex drive, and you get a result where angry crazy feminists flourish out of a backlash against the assaults towards women and female sexuality; assaults that are often invisible because they happen in virtually every single occurrence of penetrative intercourse and the women fool themselves that they enjoy it (see fake orgasm stats). That's where the "they're saying all sex is rape!" straw-man argument comes from.<br><br> by the age of 12 <br>You're either extremely exaggerating or living in a really weird country.<br>I don't really care about the age though, especially if both people involved are approximately the same age.<br><br> hurr durr landwhale angry because she's a virgin <br>I'm male.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Vaginal penetration hurts as much as anal penetration <br><br>can any femanon speak up and give their opinion? Is the vagina really such a small hole?</br></br></br>  <br> the non-existent patriarchy <br>A person must be either legitimately fucking retarded, or very seriously brainwashed to the point of near-permanent damage, if they don't see that virtually all cultures around the world are still primarily patriarchal, leaving aside shitty countries and thousands of years of history up until less than a century ago.<br><br>You *could* delude yourself into believing that modern European and Murrican countries stopped being patriarchal around 50-100 years ago, after literally thousands of years, but even that only works with the most literal interpretation of "patriarchy" which is of course not what's meant with "the patriarchy" (better termed "patriarchal culture").<br><br><br>Anal penetration doesn't hurt when you do it right. It might, maybe, have more *potential* for pain than vaginal penetration, but that's pretty irrelevant because men will do absolutely *anything* for sexual pleasure, except letting themselves be anally penetrated because it triggers their masculine insecurity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A person must be either legitimately fucking retarded, or very seriously brainwashed to the point of near-permanent damage <br>Is exactly what I think when someone say that patriarchy is still a thing. Also, fuck off with your feminism bullshit.</br></br>  <br> An entire season airs and there isn't a single piece of moeshit to be seen </br>  <br> Dont sully Kagura's face with your shitposting. <br> Posts glorious Gin-san's face. <br>What are you doing anon?</br></br></br>  <br>But Gintama is a feminist anime.<br><br> Not really, but at least not a total abomination. Also, I didn't name the image. <br><br><br>What do you think patriarchy means?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looking at pic related, I'm a very much live and let live kind of guy and would be totally open to trying anal penetration from a female, trap or futanari if necessary for her to feel comfortable enough for vaginal penetration. Would that make the relationship with a potential GF healthy or not?</br>  <br>You are right, Gintama is a 70% female audience, and I am 100% not surprised considering the glorious bodies of the men and realistic proportions of the women. By the way the men in Gintama are totally sexualised.</br>  Ayy  <br>dem childbearing hips</br>  <br>I don't see how he'd influence that fight, since both Sinbad and Kouen are monumentally stronger than him.</br>  <br>This.

These threads have been producing some interesting OC. I didn't see that coming.</br></br></br></br>    Just wondering what people think about adding some titles to the list:<br>Angel's Egg - essentially Oshii's biggest masterpiece, basically what an animated film by tarkovsky would look like<br>Serial Experiments Lain - one of the most unique avant-garde shows since the spawn of experimental series after 1995. The first series to feature designs by yoshitoshi abe.<br>A couple of series by Yuasa and Mononoke since those were some of the most succesful anime with unique art designs that weren't limited to a short form, but were actually one-cour.<br>Haruhi - might seem weird, but this sparked the huge trend of adapting light novels into anime in the last century.<br>Monogatari series - the most succesful anime series since evangelion basicaly. The epitome of Shinbo's Dezaki-influenced style so far.</br></br></br></br></br>   Haruhi  <br> Monogatari series <br>Nah, you fucked up.</br></br>  <br>Key the Metal Idol because Eva, GitS, and Lain drew inspiration from it.</br>  <br>I don't really like any of your choices for that list and the Oshii releases on there are all better than Angel's Egg. I like seeing it in date order though, I had nowhere near enough patience to bother rearranging them after getting all the images together for it.</br>  <br>Tatami Galaxy</br>  <br><br>By the way if I was going to start adding more modern things I would likely put something like Dennou Coil and Princess Kaguya on there to begin with.</br></br>  <br> Haruhi <br>Fuck off<br> Monogatari <br> the most succesful anime series since evangelion <br>So? Attack on Titan is the most popular manga's adaptation, so you should add it as well based on your lame logic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what do you think should be added?</br>  <br>Just because it is popular doesn't mean it's essential.<br>Haruhi and Monogatari are both vapid as fuck. They make money but so does Michael Bay</br></br>  <br>This list has a lot of good titles like Anne, Memories, Railroad and RoV but a lot of meme filler like Au Fou!, Daicon Films, Restaurant of Many Orders and the majority of that Ghibli shit. <br><br>How can you have a list with Totoro but not Only Yesterday, it's nonsensical. <br><br>At least it's better than the one with fucking Claymore and Berserk.</br></br></br></br></br>  Madoka should probably be added. <br><br>Inb4 your personal opinions of it.</br></br>  <br> meme filler <br>Why would you write something like that? Can you not express yourself properly? What are you even trying to say?</br></br>  <br>Ping Pong. It earned an award (IIRC) last year and easily Yuasa's magnum opus. (Kaiba on the other hand is utter crap, I don't want to see it on the list, that's for sure.)</br>  <br>then add evangelion not madoka, it's the same story.</br>  <br>Love this meme.</br>  <br> Ping Pong is easily Yuasa's magnum opus <br> Kaiba on the other hand is utter crap </br></br>  <br>I was going to add Kaguya but it slipped my mind. Also, you might not really like the choices, I mean, I don't like haruhi and I don't have much opinion on monogatari, but these are some of the most important titles of the last decade for the eason I mentioned. Also, Angel's Egg is one of the most unique pieces not only in anime but in anime in general. It's on par with the russian tale of tales. It's basically pure oshii, while all the other oshii films are kind of conatimated, maybe besides gosenzo-sama. Not to mention I'm pretty sure it's the first anima featuring designs by Yoshitaka Amono (though vampire hunter d was the same year), the best character designer ever. And if you'd want to add dennou coil, then Lain has even more merit. Together with eva and utena they're basically the avant-garde anime trinity of the 90s.</br>  <br> essential japanese animation <br> no Doraemon, Sazae-san, Maruko-chan <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> What are you even trying to say? <br><br>Let's think about what filler means anon.<br><br>also those titles have very little merit, especially Au Fou, they are there because they are obscure and old, not because they are good. That's not to say all of the older and more obscure titles on there are shit, I brought up Anne and RoV in my last post.<br><br>In terms of Ghibli I'm under the impression that whoever made this chart just had some form of nostalgia for their work. <br><br><br>I would not consider Madoka essential animation, the 3rd movie fucked whatever the series had going for it.<br><br><br> Kaiba on the other hand is utter crap <br>Easily his 2nd best work next to Tatami.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if you'd want to add dennou coil, then Lain has even more merit <br>No really it doesn't.</br></br>  <br>Dank meme friend</br>  <br>But Haruhi is essential, There were more light novel adaptations in the two years after haruhi than there were in all the years before it.</br>  <br>Dennou Coil was a tribute to lain basically.</br>  <br>Light novel adaptations are generally complete garbage. <br><br>Haruhi started a shitty trend that has haunted anime for years. There are a few good light novel adaptations but they are few and very far between.</br></br></br>  <br>Attack on Titan is essential, because it has a giant cult in Japan and the adaptation of the current most popular manga.</br>  <br>The witches dungeons are some of the most invenive animation ive seen. <br><br><br>And rebellion was a great portrayal of the insentric selfishness of the human mind all wrapped up in a loose biblical allegory. <br><br>Madoka is one of the very few anime I would call a work of art.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruhi had influence on the medium, it has nothing to do with its popularity or the fanbase.</br>  <br> Madoka is one of the very few anime I would call a work of art <br>Holy shit, kill yourself with a fork.</br></br>  <br> Monogatari series <br>Only Bakemonogatari really.</br></br>  <br> also those titles have very little merit, especially Au Fou, they are there because they are obscure and old, not because they are good. <br>That is completely incorrect though, they weren't added for that reason at all. I added them because they are some of the most important works by some of the most important independent Japanese animators.<br><br> In terms of Ghibli I'm under the impression that whoever made this chart just had some form of nostalgia for their work. <br>No not really but putting Porco Rosso on there and not having Only Yesterday was a mistake.<br><br><br> It's on par with the russian tale of tales.  <br>I don't think I can take your opinion seriously if you are going to say things like this.<br> if you'd want to add dennou coil, then Lain has even more merit <br>Dennou Coil is all round well execute and of exceptionally high quality. The animation is superb and it is the culmination of the career of one of the greatest animators to have ever worked in the industry to date. Lain on the other hand is a decent cyberpunk show with some interesting style that a lot of people overrate and get stuck in pseduo-intellectual bullshit with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And this matters how? Haruhi has fuck all going for it whether we talk about animation, direction, cinematography or narrative.<br>It's completely unimpressive and mundane in every regard.<br>Doesn't matter if it boomed LN adaptations, the work itself isn't extraordinary in any way.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Maruko really that popular? I remember really loving it as a kid.</br>  <br>Most anime is shit in general doesn't that mean we should exclude astroboy's influence?</br>  <br>Care to explain what was sooo influental about Macross DYRL then?</br>  <br> and get stuck in pseduo-intellectual bullshit with. <br>So you think your opinions are serious?</br></br>  <br>You'd be right if The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya didn't exist.</br>  <br>Only because of those trips</br>  <br>Of course. If you can't recognize that happens then you really are blind. I'm not saying that makes it a bad show specifically, just that there are a lot of people who obsesses over trivial meaningless bullshit in the show with little depth much like Evangelion.</br>   this thread <br>If you faggots thinks that Haruhi, Madoka or Monogatari deserves a spot on the chart, please get some fucking taste<br>The only thing that deserves being on this list is Tales of Princess Kaguya<br>I can't even express in words my digust towards you.</br></br></br>  <br> Taking any list with Astro Boy in it seriously. <br>This is a meme list anyways anon.</br></br>  <br>Ok, i know it's cool and edgy to shit on the more popular ambitious shows like eva, lain or utena, but you could at least make the bait more obvious so I'd know if I should waste time on you or not. If you don't recognize how big of an influence eva had on anime just try to take a moment and think how many good adult or young adult-oriented and avant-garde tv series (not films or ovas) you know from before 1995.</br>   Eva <br> Monogatari <br><br>Shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>What is wrong with you? I put Evangelion on the list myself when I first made it.</br>  Kaguya-hime, Mononoke, Hyouka, Penguindrum, and Tatami Galaxy deserve a place.  <br> Hyouka <br> Penguindrum <br>Nice bait.</br></br></br>  <br> Penguindrum <br> Hyouka <br> Tatami Galaxy <br>Jesus christ</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you do a manga one, don't you think it would be fine?<br><br><br> Hyouka </br></br></br></br>  <br> Why don't you do a manga one, don't you think it would be fine? <br>I don't read manga.</br></br>  <br>What bait?</br>  <br> But Haruhi is essential <br>Yes it is, it is essentially killing anime with the shit trend that this cancer started</br></br>  <br>Hmm, ok, i think i will do it myself then.</br>  <br>Do you actually have enough depth of knowledge to do it or will you just look stupid?</br>   Evangelion <br> No G Reco </br>  <br>Yeah i do. My photoshop skills aren't perfect but i know what manga i will use (stuff made by Tezuka, Nagai, Ishikawa, Ishinomori and Classic Jump manga).</br>  <br>So why the hell are you saying dumb shit like that about lain and eva. Lain has some of the best direction and reliance on visual exposition of any of any anime tv series, definitely better than Dennou Coil. Dennou Coild could probably be a book and it would end up not losing much, while with eva and lain it's the opposite.</br>  <br><br>Shit taste</br></br>  <br>Well, that's an entry-level chart but most of the stuff is good.</br>  <br> So why the hell are you saying dumb shit like that about lain and eva <br>Because it is true.<br> Lain has some of the best direction and reliance on visual exposition of any of any anime tv series <br>Not really.<br> definitely better than Dennou Coil. Dennou Coild could probably be a book and it would end up not losing much <br>You are one of these people that can only notice difference and think things are well directed if the style used is unsubtle, vulgar and obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wheres jojo?  Post charts.  <br>In the manga list i'm doing right now because the anime didn't adapt the best Parts .</br>  <br>NieA Under 7 and Take the X Train are shit</br>  Yuru yuri should be there.    <br>So you're using ad personams and non-statements instead of actual arguments?</br>  <br>People will bitch about their favorite shitty manga not being on the list or try to start shit over someone they think is overrated.<br><br>It's not worth it.</br></br></br>    <br>Sure. I have no intention of arguing with someone like you. Based on the statements you have made in response to me and in the OP of this thread I don't very much care for your opinions and I don't think you would be able to understand mine.</br>  <br>Would be better if the title were and/or. Some of these aren't obscure at all.</br>  <br>Au Fou is a complete joke, especially when you compare it to something like The Midnight Parasites <br><br>The fact that you even consider something like Au Fou to be anything above unwatchable drivel speaks a lot about how hard you are trying to fit in.<br><br>If you are throwing shit on there just for influence on the medium the anons saying to add garbage like Madoka and Haruhi are right.</br></br></br></br></br>   no Five Star Stories   <br>Best chart on this thread.</br>  <br>  trying to fit in <br>With who exactly? The three other people on /a/ that watched it? Two of which think it is shit? Stop applying retarded 4chan logic and try thinking.<br><br>  influence on the medium  <br>Not influence on the medium, it is really just a mixture of importance, influence, innovation, quality on various dimensions animation, storytelling, and preference.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks like someone trying to make this one  who didn't really know how.</br>   (OP)<br>Only Yesterday deserves to be added. It's Ghibli's best. It's also pretty novel in its own right as a rare attempt at a serious, adult drama.<br><br> but this sparked the huge trend of adapting light novels into anime in the last century. <br><br>That's not a postive trend. I wouldn't add Haruhi or Monogatari.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit is boring, i watched it for the loli</br></br>  <br> Yoji Kuri <br>Fuck, animations by this guy game me nightmares.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd add Oishinbou(the series), Attack No 1., maybe a Mitsuru Adachi series, probably Touch since it's more well known. Votoms, Kimagure Orange Road, Warau Salesman and Tenchi.</br></br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  <br>Awful, bottom of the barrel taste.</br>  Where is Dragon Ball and Urusei Yatsura?  <br>As expected of 3x3 shits</br>  Guy doing the manga list right here.<br>Update: It will be a list with 50 manga, i already have ~30 in my mind.</br>  <br>What purpose does this serve</br>  <br>Keep at it, I'm anxious to see it regardless if it's good or not.</br>  <br><br>Add Drifting Classroom, Honoo no Tenkousei and Kokou no Hito.</br></br>  <br>I already had Honoo no Tenkousei in my mind, i will add the other two.</br>  Bump for the manga list.  I'm sure this thread will be full of intelligent discussion and not just pretentious sniping.  <br>I think your problem is you might know a bit about animation but not about visual mediums as such in general. That might help. Less doesn't equal subtle.</br>  Too many successful and popular shows up there OP.
