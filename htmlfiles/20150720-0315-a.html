[ Would this be a better crew than the current strawhats?  If Bellamy becomes a crew member I'm killing myself.<br>Pay close attention to the news.</br>  <br>It would steamroll opponents far faster. Sanji replaced by Sabo as the token blonde strong guy, Kyros replacing Brook as the old guy with a sad long past, Law replacing Nami as the sex appeal, and Bellamy replacing Chopper as the weakling mascot character.</br>  I'd want Brook and Sanji back. I don't care if their gags got annoying, I like them.<br><br><br>Good riddance.</br></br></br>  You'd think Law would cover himself properly like Robin when he sleeps. I guess he's had enough bad influence that he just morphs into the other Strawhats. <br><br>I also like how Usopp just crawled into Luffy's bed.</br></br>  It's basically the Strawhats but much better.<br><br>So, yes</br></br>  <br>i think it's a call back to how he slept as a child from his flashback with corazon. mouth open with same posture.</br>  <br>Who is the guy sleeping next to Kyros?</br>  <br>Bellamy</br>  <br>Bellamy.</br>  <br>Christ, I can't even tell if his mouth is open or not.<br>Makes sense though<br><br><br>Binami.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well there's a close up shot of him pretty soon after</br>  <br>Turns out I'm super retarded this week.

How do you feel about a suicide pact, anon?</br>  <br>it's not about whether or not he was stating the truth, it's about how and when he did and how he used it to his advantage</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br> Kyros have 2 legs <br>sasuga oda<br>gg</br></br></br>  Does anyone have a screenshot of Doffy looking like a ballerina?

Even his crewmates are yelling at him to move the fuck on but he STILL wont listen. Didnt he learn from his mistake of going after BB when he was told not to? Pretty much spat on everyone's face that came to save him, allies, crewmates, Whitebeard, Luffy. And the person he was defending ended up dying in the end because of it. <br><br> sabo a superior brother </br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji is the ORIGINAL crew.</br>  <br>Not the first time.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, Luffy, Zoro, Nami is the ORIGINAL crew.</br>  <br> having a crew without a cook and a watch guard <br><br><br>Tell me how are they going to survive the seas without Usopp and Sanji?</br></br></br></br>  <br>stupid Ace. I even felt sorry for the guy when he asked if there were a reason for him being born, but damn he fucked up real bad.</br>  <br>Who's the fuck is Sanji ???</br>  <br> who's <br><br><br>Who*</br></br></br></br>  <br> having a crew with a misogynistic lech and a lying pervert <br><br>Tell me how is Nami's virginity going to survive until marriage with Usopp and Sanji?</br></br></br>  <br><br> don't mock the man who saved me <br><br>Well good job throwing that away twice you fucking retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> having a crew without a doctor <br> having a crew without a shipwright <br> luffy having a crew without a musician <br> implying robin isnt best girl </br></br></br></br>  <br> Sanji <br> misogynist <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br> treating women differently than men just because they have vaginas <br> not a misogynist </br></br>  <br><br> Sanji <br> misogynist <br><br>u wot m8.<br><br>Also, pretty sure unless Nami's been fucking random dudes, it is still intact on the boat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that was just how he was</br>  <br><br>Yet if he beat women up he'd be called a misogynist too.<br><br>Double standards people.</br></br></br></br>  So, what are the chances of a big fight against Fujitora? I suppose Zoro would have to do the fighting since the other guys are still broken as fuck.  <br>That wouldn't be misogynistic at all.</br>  <br><br>Well tell that to the feminists.</br></br>  <br> treating women differently = misogyny <br>I love it when SJWs change the meaning of the words because reality doesn't support their bullshit.</br></br>  don't start with this misogynistic crap you retarded fucking imbeciles<br><br><br>not very high I'd say, Fuji doesn't seem to be on good terms with Akainu so I don't see why he should go after them.  Not that I wouldn't like it. </br></br></br>  <br>I am a feminist.</br>  <br>I love it when bitter virgins change the meaning of the words because reality doesn't support their bullshit.</br>  <br><br> domestic violence case <br><br>WAAAAHHHHH MISOGYNY<br><br> chivalry <br><br>WAAAHHHH MISOGYNY<br><br>There's no winning, they must be right either way unfortunately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. I'm not saying it was out of character or anything. We've already seen him blow his cover at a freaking marine base cause he overheard someone talking smack abt WB. It's still fucking selfishly dumb of him to not keep his emotions in check in that kind of situation. Especially when so many people put their lives on the line to save his life.</br>  <br> robin best girl <br><br><br>Only if we're talking about Strong World version. She is an aging obaa-san that is going to be canon with Franky. Straw Hat Pirates only needs Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji and nothing more. Everybody else is irrelevant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody in this thread ever claimed it was misogynistic for a man to hit a woman, I claimed it was misogynistic not to just because she is a woman.<br><br>You're retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> trying to win an argument by calling your opponent a virgin <br>You're adorable.</br></br>  <br><br>Not referring to this thread you retard.</br></br>  What is Oda going to do this week during his shonen jump mandated break?  you guys just had to reply to the fucking retard right? Good, can't wait to witness 400 more posts about misogyny. Great way to start a thread.  <br> trying to win an argument by changing the argument <br>You're adorable.<br><br>Then what are you referring to?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> then what are you referring to? <br><br>SJW's.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I wonder why that retard of a faggot mangaka keeps adding new crews to Straw Hat Pirates? The chibi deer, weird nose bitch, robocop, and rotting skeleton guy should fuck off from Straw Hat crew</br>  <br><br>Suck his wife's dick. <br><br>You heard me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy in general just seems to have awful tastesin "brothers"<br> Ace: Personification of troll bait who feels compelled to white knight anything he believes in less his fragile ego be mildly askewed <br><br> Sabo: Literally written in to be Ace 2.0; threw everything out of whack so hard an entire chapter was devoted to covering up the plotholes created by his mere existence </br></br></br></br>  <br>We aren't talking about SJWs, we are talking about misogynists(like Sanji) and by extension, feminists.</br>  <br>Luffy wants at least 10 crewmates and he's retarded, that's why he picks some random shits.</br>  <br><br>  and by extension, feminists <br><br>Exactly, SJW's.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>A lot of doujins and fanart depict Law to be someone who sleeps quietly and "properly". I can't find the right term, sorry. I like how he actually isn't like that. He just sprawls on the bed or floor, like how he did as a kid. Adorable. Torao is adorable. I don't want him to go. I really don't want him to go. <br><br>But he has to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> parroting your opponent </br>  <br>unless Brook does something great real fucking soon I'm going to get mad.

He might be a walking chivalrous pervert stereotype and he might act like a whiteknight, but his behavior is still quite mysoginistic.</br></br>  <br><br>Not by the definition, it isn't.<br><br>Just go open your dictionary.</br></br></br></br>  <br> don't make a real argument, just call them names! <br>Misogynist defenders, everyone.</br></br>  <br>Thank you, anon.</br>  <br>look at this glorious motherfucker. He needs some screentime as soon as possible.<br><br><br>sadly this is no place for this kind of discussions, so no one really gives a fuck about what you think of the matter either way</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well he got some screentime in the recent chapter, so that's good.<br><br> inb4 Urouge-Enel alliance. </br></br></br></br>  <br>he used to be such a cute child.</br>  <br>yeah it was a bliss to see him again, but I want him to interact with the SHs. He's one chill bastard,  and if he allied with Enel shit would go down </br>  <br><br>Well, who else could make it to some random Sky Island that precise?<br><br>Maybe he's come back from the moon, and his CoO can pick up people like no other. <br><br>Urouge is a high-priest after all too, interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No worries. It's obvious that he's going to join Barto's crew.</br></br>  <br>Enel reked his home island, I doubt he would ally with him. <br> he'll ally with BB's crew </br></br>  <br><br>I forgot/didn't know he was from Bilka.</br></br>  <br> &gt;he'll ally with BB's crew<br/> <br><br>nigga they already have  kuzan , I don't even want to imagine how hilariously strong they would get with him. Then again, Enel seems a bit too full of himself to me, I somehow doubt he would ally with  based blackbeard </br></br></br>   hating Sanji because he likes women more than men <br>Maybe feminists do care about men, after all.</br>  <br>And I'm fine with that, but it's not like you can prevent me from talking about this stuff or get me banned for this kind of post. It is in topic.<br>You're just afraid I might summon Rebeccafag back with this kind of subject, and I do agree that the thread kind of turns to shit even without him when the subject is touched upon, so I didn't plan on discussing this too much. I just thought I'd give my two cents.<br>tl;dr Calm you tits.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Think he meant Urouge.</br></br>  <br>I meant Urouge will ally with BB's crew, not Enel.</br>  <br><br>my bad, I misunderstood.  I don't want Urouge to join BB because they would have to job him real hard </br></br>  <br><br> implying he wouldn't kill BB and form the true Fallen Monk Pirates </br></br>  <br>Kuros has two legs?</br>  Isn't Urouge the weakest supernova though? Or is it another case of bounty =/= power?  <br><br>Urouge is Urouge.</br></br>  <br>it is not, as a matter of fact, you are discussing your different views about the meaning of the word 'misogynyst' which doesn't relate to one piece at all, and if someone uses it in a way that doesn't appeal to you to define a character you have no real reason to bump in and start or engage into a completely pointless discussion that involves SJW bullshit and such. These threads can get already bad staying on topic, let's just not discuss this kind of shit further shall we.<br><br> also as you said there's a chance we might summon HIM, now that would be the death of the thread </br></br></br>  <br> looking at a rock is cute <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I hadn't noticed they weren't there. Where are they?</br>  <br>what does a bounty matter to a superior being?</br>  <br>That was my first post in the thread. I wasn't the guy you were answering to, so I wasn't really "discussing" per se.</br>  I can't wait to see Sanji lie in a pool of his own blood  <br> what does a bounty matter to a superior being? <br>Go back to bed, Bellamy</br></br>  <br>Kyros got the leg back after he regained his old form</br>  <br><br>What does Bellamy have to do with anything? <br><br>We are talking about Urouge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bellamy has a higher bounty than Zoro.</br>    <br>Not the anon you were talking to, but I like the image. I like the idea of Law being the favorite son. Kind of tragic that one brother ended up killing the other because they had different views of how Law should be brought up.<br><br>Well, yeah, Roci is a marine spy and all that, but I just really like the family kind of theme, okay?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Zoro's is pretty outdated though.</br></br>    <br><br>Yeah I like it too.<br><br>Another thing is, Doffy is a douche etc., but I can fully understand why he killed his brother - he's essentially like an underworld mob boss really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Admire your commitment, but you need to stop</br>  <br>Well you tell me how many legs does Kyros have in OP's image</br>  This is the shittiest thread we've had in a while. Post cute pics to save it.  <br> This is the shittiest thread we've had in a while. <br> Let's make it more shit! </br></br>  <br>You said it homodachi.</br>  <br><br>Thats because its full of newfags who keep replying to the SJW who in reality is a troll moefag from iirc trying to ruin one piece threads because "muh board culture"</br></br>  <br>law</br>  <br>I agree. Doffy might have been an evil person, but Roci had to die after what he did. Doffy had to do it as the head of the family.<br><br>I wonder how he actually felt about Law leaving, too. He saw a part of himself in Law and was hoping the kid would help fuck up the world with him. So much for dreams, Doffy.</br></br></br>  Straw Hats only needs the first 5 crew.  <br>This, the newfags don't realise the trolls true goals and they reply to people like Rebeccafag</br>  <br><br>Yeah, you talk to the Feds, you're donezo.</br></br>  <br> Straw Hats dont need a shipwright who is also a very durable heavy hitter </br>  <br>That's not a number of legs. You or that anon said he didn't regain it</br>  <br><br> no doctor <br> no shipwright <br><br>Good luck with that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't me, and he didn't regain it after becoming human again if that's what you meant. <br><br>Law probably just gave him one</br></br></br>  <br>SJW's are afraid of 4chan, they don't come here. <br><br>The people that claim to be SJWs here are almost always trolls</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean that he regained it at the same time he turned back</br>  <br>I don't know for most people, but I never claimed to be one, I just always get called out for being one. <br>Do people even unironically call themselves SJWs in the first place ?</br></br>  <br><br> shipwright <br><br>Usopp can do a decent job maintaining a ship.<br><br><br> doctor <br><br>Sanji can just study medicinal cooking. Fuck doctors.<br><br><br>As I've said, Straw Hat Pirates only needs Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. I will never acknowledge those other literally who faggots that tries to blend in the Straw Hat culture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I didn't mean that he regained it at the same time he turned back <br><br><br> Kyros got the leg back after he regained his old form </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Usopp can do a decent job maintaining a ship <br><br>Good job that did the Merry - they wouldn't have made it past W7. <br><br>Even with the Sunny, only Franky can maintain it properly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure Mr "he only has one leg, you're baiting"</br>  <br>They can always raid another ship and claim it as their own. Straw Hat doesn't need that fat hairy cyborg guy.</br>  <br>they treat their ship like crew you fucking retard</br>  <br> Franky is not more useful than Usopp </br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br> dat Brook laugh <br><br>Still gets me every time.</br></br></br>  <br>Crocodile is cute! Cute!</br>  <br>Usopp is worth more than any of those shitty "additions" post-Sanji combined excluding Vivi, because Vivi is Luffy's canon lover.</br>  <br><br> because Vivi is Luffy's canon lover. </br></br>  <br>I agree. He's a criminal, though. He'd better redeem himself for all the innocent people he killed indirectly.</br>  <br>Vivi is cute, even way cuter than Nami. Fuck you.</br>    <br> Usopp can do a decent job maintaining a ship <br>Maintaining it is one thing, but can Usopp make things like Gaon Cannon, Coup de Burst and Mini Merry AND make them run on a cheap drink?</br></br>  <br>Paulie is cute! Cute!</br>  <br> being a retard <br>Vivi obviously loves luffy's cannon</br></br>  <br>Paulie is a nice person but I don't like his rough personality, which reflects the way some close-minded patriarchical people can be. There are many construction workers who act the way like he does without the "respect" part. It's problematic.</br>  <br><br>I never said she wasn't, nor did I make any reference to Nami.<br><br>There is little to no chance of romance between the crew until even the end of the series - Oda has even affirmed that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He may have said that, but what about a character who isn't in the crew yet and who will join it soon? It's very likely for Rebecca to build slowly a relationship with Luffy, even if Oda will just put some hints like he already did in order not to shock the very young readers about something they are far from being very knowledgeable about and that could make them have promiscuous thoughts that children should never have before they begin to reach puberty.</br>  <br>No. The only romance that needs to be in One Piece is the romance for adventure.</br>  <br>Doflamingo! Doflamingo is cute! Having dinner with Doflamingo! Doflamingo tutoring you about tactics and strategy! Clinging to Doflamingo's hairy leg!</br>  <br>Friendship and love are also romance. In the first place, love is synonymous with romance. So it's alright for love to exist. Don't you know that adventure is also based on people fighting together, which means friendship and which means friendly love?</br>  <br>Even if Oda said that, you are implying that the future Pirate King does not deserve to put his sticky fertile seed into the finest woman that a man can avail, in this regards, Vivi is the perfect woman that Luffy can avail. How can the Pirate King continue his legacy if he's not going to breed?<br><br><br> rebecca <br>Shut the fuck up, Straw Hats doesn't need another shitty crew.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't ask me, ask Oda. <br><br>The only romance Luffy loves is adventure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo has a very likeable personality and behaves well with women. He even hates people who try to seduce and deceve Baby 5. This part of him is admirable. If only he wasn't a pirate...</br>  <br>Straw Hats are a fine crew, even if there are problematic people such as Sanji, and Rebecca is everything but shitty so it would be alright for her to join the SH crew.<br><br>Luffy also loves meat and humans so there would be no problem if he loved Rebecca.</br></br></br>  <br>  mysoginist <br><br>Etymology: from Greek "μισεω"(miseo) meaning " I hate", and γυνη(gyne) meaning "woman". Literally " I hate women", translated to "hate of women.<br>Definition: Misogynyis the hatred or dislike ofwomenorgirls. <br>SJW definiton: misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, includingsexual discrimination, belittling of women,violence against women, andsexual objectificationof women.<br>Translated tumblr hambeast definition: he is a mysoginist  (literally he hates women)  because he doesn't use violence against women, even if a man uses violence against women he is a mysoginist. Also he is a mysoginist because he's always trying to get pussy  (but I thought he hated women...?) <br><br>Tl;dr don't bend word meaning to you your liking, retard</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  so no chapter this week right?  <br>A misogynist is a man who behaves in a disrespectful way toward women just because they are women.</br>  <br> he likes Doflamingo <br>Hey, you might not be so shit after all.</br></br>  <br>Yes, unfortunately it means that there won't be Rebecca joining the SH this chapter, but we can hope for next week. Let's be patient and wait forever, Oda will deliver sooner or later what readers want.<br><br><br>I like his personality, but not the fact that he hurt countless people. Please don't misunderstand me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wtf, it seems like I forgot to type some space in between words? Now I look like the retarded one</br>  <br>The only problematic "crew" are those faggots I don't give a shit about after Sanji became part of Straw Hat.<br><br><br>As I've said, the original Straw Hat crew, which is the first 5 member, is the only acceptable Straw Hat Pirates.

No way he's going to reach Impel Down.  r-right? <br><br><br>anon... seriously...</br></br></br>  <br>You must be living in a random shithole like Phillipine then, no wonder you act more like a monkey than a human.</br>  <br>we're not being serious, theres a reason terms like newfag, oldfag, tripfag and namefag get used, because you aren't meant to take everything you see on 4chan seriously</br>  <br>You should be banned for shitposting.</br>  <br><br> Phillipine <br><br>Nope, I'm white.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A social law.<br><br><br>Not really, using the word "nigger" isn't funny.<br><br><br>You should be banned for reversetrolling.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> complains about non-serious prejudice <br> says people from Phillipine are more monkey then humans </br></br>  <br><br>Social laws are not legally enforceable.</br></br>  Why is every new strawhat weaker than the starting strawhats?

He should join in the next arc right?</br></br>  <br>Phillipine is not a shithole, but please don't go overboard because it looks like you think that south east asian people are monkeys, which they aren't.

Holy fuck I need ep 3  http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/so267<wbr>33724<br><br>some of the extra vids</br></br></wbr>   Reminder that Ms. Smith is best girl.   <br>doubles and trips? its been too long</br>  Holy shit, how can a thread be so dead.  <br>I'd say 'burned out with nothing to talk about', but we had raws dumped a few hours ago.</br>  Just finished the manga. Judging from everyone else's reaction and the uncanny resemblance of the two. She finally snapped, right?  yes  she's a bear, jim.  <br>I was about to post this. Where can I find the other chapters?</br>  Kei is daijobu  <br>I wonder if we can see here again. She was the girl they saw before leaving the school right?<br> money says that she is still alive </br></br>  It's all Yuki's fault! The little retard made her snap!  <br>The little retard is keeping them together. On a side note, I wonder how she would react to being raped with her retard vision.</br>  <br>An even deeper delusion, where she's happily married, and her husband gives her sweet love every night...<br>Damn, that sounds depressing.</br></br>  <br>Delicious.</br>  Why do people complain about shovel being used goods when there is a literal goddess around?  <br> crossdressing boy </br>  I know this is a cute girls doing cute things, but why are adults almost completely absent? You would think there would be one adult that isn't infected  <br>Fuck off. Blonde Yui is a miracle.</br>  <br>Other humans in general have been pretty rare.</br>  <br> STANDING! </br>  Is het Ayaya the ultimate Ayaya?  <br>Now THAT I can fap to.</br>  <br>Footjob doujin when?</br>  I want them to be transported to the KinMoza world Ruu and Megu-nee included. They don't have to be dykes. I just don't want them to suffer. ;_;  <br>Wish granted.<br><br> The zombies are transported with them. </br></br></br>  <br> ON THE EDGE </br>  <br><br>Dig through the archives. Someone translated them sometime in the last 2 weeks or so.</br></br>  <br>The Mosaics can handle it... right?<br>Oh fuck. They're all goners once they encounter a blonde zombie.</br></br>  <br> ON THE CRATER </br>  <br> YOU FUCKED IT UP </br>  <br>I don't want to see my daughteru become a zombie</br>  <br> I'm sorry! </br>  I'm hoping the anime sparks enough interest so that scanlators pick up the pace.  <br>It's pretty caught up</br>  <br>I started self inserting myself and it got out of hand. It got to the point I went on patrol and I got bit but didn't tell the girls. Then I knew my time was running out so I gave into my selfish desires and molested one of them in the late night but didn't have the heart or condoms to ejaculate inside for possible infection. After the deed, I slide the revolver with one bullet that I found to her and tell her my situation. In the end I accepted everything.</br>  <br>There are only 2 chapters (36 &amp; 37) which have shit scans</br>  <br>We're caught up to the most recent chapter, though the last two are translated from Korean. The guy that usually does the Japanese scanlations is on vacation until next month.</br>  <br>You're a bad person even in your fantasies.</br>  <br>I wanna nipple on those thighs.</br>   It's all Yuki's fault! The little retard made her snap! <br><br> I think Yuki saw the onset of a nervous breakdown coming from Yuuri and knew what would come next, so she set the bear down, knowing that Yuuri might go back in and bring it back. She slipped it back there when nobody but Kurumi would see it. Yuki, of all people, knows this insanity shit better than most. </br></br>  This better have a happy ending. The girls are just trying to get by in a zombie infested world and so much bad shit has happened to them.  ;_;   <br><br>where can I find 36 and 37? it's not up on the manga sites or listed on manga updates.</br></br>  On another note, where do you think the anime will go? Original anime end, or will they stop with the "graduation"?  <br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/6asgq<wbr>jUM/file.html<br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/gerMN<wbr>YWC/file.html</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>No, she left the bear there and prayed to it as a memorial to all the dead children. Rii was never supposed to adopt it.</br>  <br>Graduation. I don't know why people think it'll suddenly veer off into anime original territory. It's exceedingly obvious that the author still wants to go to the same place, but is just taking a slightly new route in the anime to get there.</br>  <br> she's probably already eaten a few studentes <br>Zombies are already there</br></br>  <br><br>thanks anon</br></br>  In this universe, a yuru and a mosaic are straight.    <br><br>I feel like it's a bit TOO obvious. Maybe it's a fake out.</br></br>  <br>she's too far gone now, man.</br>  <br>I really love the authors paneling work that's what it's called right?</br>  <br>That's the great thing about this series. They've pulled enough bait-and-switch crap that people are left wondering if the ruse is itself a ruse and if it's all part of some mega-meta ruse.</br>  <br>TOO LEWD<br><br><br>TOO FUCKING LEWD</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't see a bad end, so far the girls always avoided permanent problems and are generally ok (zombie Shovel being the exception). One might die but that's it.</br>  <br> Ruu "crying" at night. <br><br>That's just fucked up.</br></br></br>  I can't wait for episode 3. This series is good.<br><br>I even got my sister into it. She likes horror.</br></br>  <br> but that's it <br>One of them dying isn't small.</br></br>  <br>Well, it's smaller than 4 of them dying, rape dungeons, army experiment guinea pigs.</br>  <br> are generally ok <br>Rii is even more messed up than cathat.<br>Shovel is dying.<br>Miki is going to see her 2nd close friend dead soon.<br>I doubt cathat can survive another megunee type trauma when she see shovel turn into a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's ok, anon. Please don't cry. </br>  <br>The thing is, I want to see more things. The problem with zombie scenarios is that they mostly go for the "some die, some live" part with a huge hope for a brighter tomorrow. I want to see a scenario where the girls lose their humanity little by little and on several aspects without going full edge/rape dungeon. And so far, I am satisfied. To have them turned so subtly into mental and physical wrecks and live through it would be so damn satisfying.</br>  <br>Kurumi has pulled off miracles before, she can do it again.</br>  Manga Rii looks like Shenua sometimes.  <br>But those things aren't going to happen. Death would badly fuck them up. They are very close and still young remember. Especially if Yuki died</br>  <br>I feel like if one of them dies it's pretty much over.</br>  <br><br>Fuuuuuuuuck. No wonder bigtits was having some weird visions.<br><br>Betting for the teddybear getting damaged, so that they have to sew it and end with an (imaginary) frankenloli</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they can handle losing Rii. But right now Kurumi and Yuki are their most important members, I don't think either of them will die unless it's at the end.</br>  Was the "Mii-kun! Pantsu!!" scene from last episode in the manga too ?<br><br> we might be in for a fanservicey ride </br></br>  <br> Kurumi and Yuki <br>You do realize that only leaves Miki, right?<br><br>She has proven to be strong completely on her own and doesn't even need Yuki's mental support all that much</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like Miki is the most likely to survive out of the bunch, though.</br>  <br>Miki could survive on her own. Kurumi could physically, but mentally would be fucked up if Yuki died. Rii couldn't survive their deaths physically or mentally. Yuki couldn't survive physically, but would probably just put up more barriers mentally</br>  So the chances that the group meets a family member is null by now, uh?. I guess they want to keep a "lord of the flies" atmosphere with no meddling adults.  <br>She was already beginning to break before they got there. I honestly would've given her maybe a couple of weeks more, before offing herself.<br><br><br>Their parents are either shuffling around at their workplace everyday, and at their homes in the morning, or double dead from some passerby. There's always the thought that they were eaten alive, and that there's nothing left of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no meddling adults <br>helicopter-kun probably wasn't a high schooler</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't count it out, but there's nothing gearing towards that development at this point, besides the visit to Kurumi's house.</br>   delusional happy-go-lucky <br> bashes head with a shovel <br><br>No idea who Miki and Rii could be.</br></br></br>  <br>Miki's problem was being in a closed small place. If she had a whole building she could cope, I think reading books is her form of barrier.</br>  Try two with resized image in live thread.  <br> helmet is seating <br>still, nice catch, anon.</br></br>  <br>Oh boy, now we got two</br>  <br> nice catch <br>How the fuck did you not notice that?</br></br>  <br>was rushing it, I guess. I just finished the whole thing this morning just so I could join the threads.</br>  <br>Anon, if you don't do it properly, people will just laugh at your mistakes. Now go back and properly read it.</br>  <br>I did promise to make it last thread. We'll see what gets saved then.<br><br><br>Damn it man you had me thinking I made a typo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I also read it really quickly and missed little details. I had no idea what "nibble" you guys were talking about and what do you know, Yuki was nibbling on Shovel's thigh.</br>  <br>Even when rushing, it's still pretty obvious. I also thought that the pilot was angered for some reason but the girls were just right there so it wasn't possible. And there was only one reason for him to crush a syringe. <br>People should use their brains.</br></br>  <br>Nibble!<br>I really hope this won't bite us in the future.<br>I can't stand the thought of zombie Yuki.</br></br></br>  Where do zombie outbreaks usually start at? Hospitals?  <br>Depends on the setting<br><br>If it's just a normal infection, hospitals(if it takes that long to turn, otherwise anywhere)<br>If it's some experiment, anywhere</br></br></br></br>  <br>Restaurants or hospitals, or secret labs. Usually a few infected, then it goes in the street, in a very crowded area. From this point onwards, it becomes pandemic.</br>  <br>I thought research labs were the typical starting points</br>   Every thread until it happens.   <br> Please take care or yourself <br> But I'm only taking a look <br><br>Kurumi-chan! Why didn't you stay true to your word?!</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is something mesmerizing in that smile and gaze.</br>  <br>Shovel is used goods?</br>  <br>She isn't. Anons always dramatize when a girl expresses affection or love towards a boy.</br>  <br>And she was so angry just a couple of pages before.</br>  <br>This and well mostly shitposting. All girls are good girls.<br><br>Well dunno about that dude Miki wearing a garter belt.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Miki <br> boy <br>She makes my blood boil.</br></br></br>  <br>you're just gay.<br>go back to your trap anime.</br></br>   our own school life that no one can imitate <br>heh</br>  <br>What are Yuki and Kurumi looking at?</br>  <br> I think reading books is her form of barrier. <br><br>Reading the Stand from Steppen King while being in a zombie apocalypse, kek.<br><br>It would be cool if she kept rambling on her journal. It may be the only proof left from their existence.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your dick.</br>  <br>Don't worry. She'll forget all about the bear and the fact that she was going crazy once she becomes addicted to cocks.</br>  <br> It would be cool if she kept rambling on her journal. It may be the only proof left from their existence. <br>Fuck. I can see this happening.</br></br>  <br>Can't this girl pose like a ordinary schoolgirl? Every picture of her screams "fuck me already!", like she hasn't feel a dick for months.</br>  <br>Is that meant to be a bad thing now?</br>    So why is everyone saying Yuki snapped out of the delusion?    <br>My favorite GG. She's so gorgeous and overflowing with sex appeal.</br>  <br>Did you skim through the manga too?</br>  <br> A bit<br/> I remember this part but I thought it was just another temporary lapse, brought on by her actually needing to do something.</br>  <br>She's literally not speaking about Megu-nee recently, except when Yuuri speaks about her. The roles are clearly reversed and Yuki is now playing along because she knows she must do it.</br>  <br>just sweeping it under the rug at this point</br>  <br>Even Miki is looking at her wrong.</br>  Watching Rii-san go insane is good for my dick  Nobody cared about her till she put on the hat  <br>In her case people cared for her more when she took off the hat.</br>  <br> Yuki is already old enough to smoke and play eroge </br>  <br>But if she hadn't put the hat on she wouldn't have been able to take it off</br>  I just realized how unsettling this manga can be. Imagine being a third party member unknowning of everything that has happened so far and entering the van in  . You will find a schoolgirl treating a teddybear as her little sister, another one cheerfully talking about field trips with her (ghost/dead) teacher, a former infected who won't let go of a shovel and finally someone who decided to play along to not break the group's idyllic dynamic.<br><br>And somehow, YOU are the crazy deluded one if you don't follow their little game of white lies. Or you will start thinking it is so.<br><br>Oh, and there's a zombie apocalyse. Merry fucking christmas.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone fucking upload it to batoto jesus christ</br>  <br>Ruu wasn't there in that chapter yet, and the delusional one seems to be Yuuri.<br>Everything else seems normal.</br></br>    <br>I fucking love tomboys.</br>    <br>This just makes me want to dash in and pull it down just to watch her face changing from dazed confusion.</br>  <br>Theres one page where she's leaning and you can see the outline of her pussy</br>  <br>Tell me more.</br>  <br>Find it yourself m8</br>  <br>Was getting bit part of her plan?</br>  My favorite scene  <br> Didn't she get clawed? </br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>Bit.</br>  <br>You're lying to me.</br>  <br>Yes, she's training to become the zombie version of blade</br>  <br>Who cares, it's been used anyway.</br>  <br>Wait, you don't mean...<br><br>Ha ha, they're fucked. Shouldn't have thrown the Gensokyo gun.<br><br>;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gakkou's are pure, anon. Pure.</br>  <br>You can still make it in time. Go and help them before it's too late.</br>  <br>Guns are more trouble than they're worth. Throwing it away was a good decision.</br>  <br>Not Shovel</br>  <br>Does this cumslut look pure to you?</br>  <br>You know what they say, anon. When in Rome, do as the  Romans  do.</br>  <br>They would be useful if one of the girls is about to turn though</br>  <br>Yes!</br>  <br>But that was the reason Miki threw it away. She didn't want to encourage Kurumi's idea of zombie euthanasia and hope for the best.<br><br>daijobu daijobu daijobu</br></br></br>  <br>If she hadn't found the bear she'd probably be dead and/or bitten.</br>    <br>That's just her way of begging to have her mouth filled with cock</br>  <br>The dog too?</br>  <br>I actually thought she might've been bitten and just not told/shown the others, but if that was the case she'd have shown signs long before the end of chapter 37</br>  <br>That's a boy.</br>  <br>I'm sure dogs would enjoy having their mouths filled with cock. Until they bite it off and chew it into pieces anyhow</br>  <br>That only makes my dick harder.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure you'd fuck a zombie if you could, anon.</br>  Just finished the manga and..<br>1) Ruu-chan is alive or this is imagination Rii-san ?<br>2) I hope that Kurumi will be ok</br></br>  Miki is probably the only one that's going to make it out "okay" isn't she?   In addition to food and water, electricity is needed in our modern society. There are solar panels on the roof, two water mills connected to Wicked River, all of which are used to power the school. The Student Council sells the excess water and electricity for savings for the Conquering Dragon Festival, and the students learn naturally through their lives here how precious electricity is. <br>Why are they worried about not getting enough solar panel energy if they have water mills?<br><br>Of course. It would be pretty exciting when a single scratch could kill you</br></br></br>  <br>She will probably get a "You are the mosters, Miki" ending.</br>  Hopefully the half zombification means she doesn't age.  <br>Maintaining a mill is considerably harder. Though batteries have some shortish lifetime.</br>  <br>She gets bitten by Shovel in the end, so they can continue their relationship.</br>  <br>It's gonna be plot armor for her and the group. If they need something done and there's a horde of zombies? They'll just send Kurumi to walk by them. Of course the downfall is that she has to be extremely quiet since they still react to sound.</br>  <br>Why is it called Wicked River again? I thought there was a superstition against negative or evil names.</br>  <br>That gun would be pretty fucking useful to them right now.<br><br>Maybe the mills are down.</br></br></br>  <br> miki and shovel are the only survivors, half zombies and roaming around trying to find other people </br>  <br>They could just concentrate on maintaining one though, and it would still most likely generate more energy than the solar PV</br>  <br>With zombies crawling around? Where is the aforementioned mill in the first place? Leaving the school grounds is dangerous enough on foot.</br>  Why do all the human characters' names end in "i"?  <br>It's a mill for generating electricity, it most likely has fencing &amp; barbed wire</br>  <br>Because they are trying to keep their egos intact, therefore they must alway care their "I"'s in their mind.</br>  <br>But anon, Kurumi also ends in "i".</br>  <br> Yuki <br> Kurumi <br> Miki <br> Yuuri <br> Kei <br> Megumi <br>GOD DAMN IT.<br> Taromaru <br> Ruu </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And probably isolated which would make both entering and exiting there harder, also the must consider their resources, the school had easily accessible food.</br>  <br>Umaibo.<br><br>The fuck is an umaibo?</br></br></br>  <br>Ruu might be a nickname for Ruri or something else.  Doesn't make her any more real. </br>  <br>Mugi<br>Niggu</br></br>  This is literally the most depressing manga I've ever read and I've read The Road and The Mist. Especially when Rii snapped. She was supposed to be the onee-san for fuck's sake. Now she's the most broken.    <br>being in this thread is enough to make me feel the downs.</br>  <br>It's gap moe. You expect the nee-san archetype girl to be perfect and always dependable, but her imperfection makes her even cuter.</br>  <br>This <br>Plus zombies that they can encounter along the way. I don't think it's worth doing the trip unless they're in a large group of other survivors.</br></br>  <br>Must be hard for Yuki, she was in that state not to long ago, and now that she gets better she has to deal with her friend suffering the same condition.</br>  What if the teddy gets infected?  They're all going to fall deeper and deeper into despair, and there's nothing we can do but watch.  <br> suffering the same condition. <br>Rii is arguably in a worse position considering she has nothing in her subconscious preventing her from acting retarded, unlike Yuki who had Megu-nee.</br></br>  <br>Zombie teddy will bite Rii. She will take it willingly.</br>  <br>Especially now that they're traveling and meeting other, potentially dangerous survivors.</br>  <br>Then they are fucked.</br>  <br>If even one of them gets raped then I'm dropping this shit.</br>  <br>Personally I'm hoping for some boy-on-unwilling-boy action for Mii-kun.</br>  <br>She has Ruu. She'll probably play it safe in order to take care of her. At least she's aware of the zombies.<br><br>They'll probably reach a point were the bear ha to be left behind and she'll want to go back for it and someone will have to slap her and tell her it's bear Jim.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly if Rii does I'd probably get turned on. Unless the rapists rip apart the teddy bear and Rii still sees it as Ruu and thinks she sees her little sister substitute get killed in front of her.</br>  <br> Unless the rapists rip apart the teddy bear and Rii still sees it as Ruu and thinks she sees her little sister substitute get killed in front of her. <br> Rii sees it as the rapists dismembering her imouto limb by limb as Ruu screams in pain, staring at her the whole time <br> Rii goes comatose </br></br></br>  <br>On second thought, I might still get turned on.</br>  <br><br>The manga has been fairly restrained in its gore up until now, so that would be an exceptionally horrifying scene.</br></br>  <br> the GGs have to leave her behind or else risk the same fate <br> group falls apart <br>God, this isn't even the worst case scenario and there's already 50 ways they could all get fucked over.</br></br></br>  Rii really is the most likely to get raped. She's got the biggest breasts, she's the most feminine, she's physically weak, and she's crazy. Any of the other survivors can notice how attached she is to the bear, snatch it when she's not looking, and leave a note to go to a certain location alone or "her little friend" gets it.  RIP Rii, Ruu  RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! FUCKING SANEFAGS! GET OUT OF MY SCHOOL! GET OUT! GET OUT!   yfw college girls trick the Gakkous and bring them to the university's gang boss to perform as sex slaves in exchange of shelter, food and not being fucked daily   <br>Go back to /r9k/ Rii-san.</br>  so anyone actually going to buy the manga when it comes to the US in november?   all this talk of rape <br>please no</br>  <br>I found Kokou no Hito the most depressing manga so far. GG! is top-tier too, keeping you on the edge all the time. And we know very well how nothing will end well.</br>    <br>It's not going to happen, not even near-rape.

I'm so hungry.  <br><br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=MkJ<wbr>-4YoSHmE</wbr>  [ ] </br></br>  <br> During World War I, the entrenching spade was also pressed into service as amelee weapon. In the close confines of a trench, rifles and fixed bayonets were often too long for effective use, and entrenching tools were often used as auxiliary arms forclose-quarterfighting.From 1915, soldiers on both sides routinely sharpened the edges of entrenching shovels for use as weapons <br><br>Yes they do</br></br></br>    <br> can dig stuff <br> can be used to kill <br> can even be used to cook <br>What can't a shovel do?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Bring back Megu-nee </br>  <br> And everyone else had to protect her too, making up the club, rules, taking cares of chores and keeping the school safe for Yuki. Remember Yuki mentions hearing Kurumi and Yuuri arguing sometimes, and that's because they have to do a lot of shit behind the scenes to keep her safe. <br><br>Uhh, no. Kurumi and Rii argue about all sorts of things, from her to the apocalypse to their own problems. It's also kinda retarded to believe that they made the school safe just for Yuki and not, like, everyone's survival.<br>In fact it was Megu-nee who made them start cleaning the floors of the zombies.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Spawn an imouto for Rii-san. </br>  <br>It's a leftover from when the city was named Danto. To make a comparison, in Higurashi the main families in Hinamizawa literally thought they were demons. This seems to be a somewhat similar situation.</br>  <br>It's literally one of the best melee weapons in existance, useful not only for fighting situations but also to break things, doors, make way out of rubble, dig and build shit.<br><br>What's really important for a melee weapon is durability, and shovels excel at that.</br></br></br>  Can someone explain the Mexican mustache thing? Is it just 1-2 anons forcing some stupid joke?  <br>It's the same mustache the bear and Ruu have, so I guess so.</br>  <br>I think an anon requested the teddy bears mustache be shooped onto other characters and it went from there.</br>  <br><br>I just added some moustaches to the gurashis<br> Is it just 1-2 anons forcing some stupid joke? <br> Yes </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can't find chapter 36, where did you find it ?</br></br>  <br>Make it three, I'm another anon trying to force the Punished Miki and Guracho joke.</br>  <br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/6asgq<wbr>jUM/file.html<br>Here you go anon.</br></wbr></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure there's at least more than two anons pushing the punished Miki joke.</br>  <br>Can't seem to find 37 either.

Kurumi and Rii argue about all sorts of things, from her to the apocalypse to their own problems. <br>You agree with me then? Because that's what I fucking said, they argued about this stuff all the time when Yuki was away because they wanted to keep her safe.<br><br>  It's also kinda retarded to believe that they made the school safe just for Yuki and not, like, everyone's survival. <br>That's not even what I said, you fucking idiot. The point is that the school was safe because of them and not Yuki, it was only because of their efforts that Yuki could be safe back then.<br><br> In fact it was Megu-nee who made them start cleaning the floors of the zombies. <br>Yes and? Again, that doesn't mean Yuki could take care of herself. Others were taking care of her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Motherfucker, I knew she reminded me of something, but I couldn't narrow it down until now.</br>  Megu-nee could have saved everybody a lot of grief if she had just read her stupid manual.    <br><br>Miki  a best </br></br>  <br>Truly a miracle of the universe</br>  <br>I don't have to take that from two nutcases, one chuuni boy and a corpse.</br>  Is cathat a boatslutfag?<br>Why is she listing all the boatslut name while studying?</br>  Post anything JJBA!

The board probably requested Araki to use harsher subject matter to appeal to UJ readers.</br>  <br>Secchan looks like he's got quite a bit of swagger on him, doesn't he?</br>  <br> We will never get Giorno vs literally anyone in fictional history on Death Battle <br> Meanwhile these fucks keep wasting time with Goku vs Supes </br></br>  <br>Nah, this is definitely Araki's own doing.</br>  <br>He looks even more like Josuke 4 now with that walk.</br>  <br><br>Vento Aureo &gt; Diamond is Unbreakable &gt; Battle Tendency &gt; Steel Ball Run &gt; Stardust Crusaders &gt; Phantom Blood &gt; Stone Ocean</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck</br>  <br>There a few things in Touhou that were inspired by JJBA.

He even got his old name back with a waifu to boot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, he looks way better than part 5 sameface style. I always was irked by almost every character in part 5 having the same nose, jaw, cheek bones, and eye shapes.<br><br>I honestly could not tell who the characters were if their hair or clothes weren't in the frame.</br></br></br>  <br>Higashikata can also be read as Toho.</br>  <br>JoJo has had heavy shit before, but nothing as bad and consistent as Part 8 so far.

It's OP as fuck. It's possible you'll get longer with characters more proficient in stopping time, but I wouldn't count on it. The game is a slave to balance.</br>  <br>Yeah but I couldn't figure out how to make them work so I've been playing 8 and 14 unpatched.</br>  Why why why is the piece of trash game EoH being made?<br>It looks bad, it plays bad, it FEELS bad. Fucking shitty arena fighting bullshit to try and get the naruto bux, of course that's all CyberCrap2 knows how to do, fucking assholes.<br>Fucking let Capcom make another game, they're pretty much the only people who still know how to make fighting games nowadays, hell I'd take Heritage for the Future 2 at this point.</br></br>  <br><br><br>No one said ASB wasn't broken either. The fact this is an arena brawler may make it an even likelier reality</br></br></br>  <br> More Capcomfags </br>  <br><br>You can't say its realistic though. These days everything is about sex.</br></br>  <br>No game is intentionally broken.</br>  <br> hurr durr I don't want quality games for my animus <br>Bamco sucks dick at fighting games, they make the casualest shit in the market.

EoH is completely fine.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>I think the entire idea of each Touhou having a latent power is inspired by Jojo too, like Remillia controlling fate, Sakuya has time control, Yukari has the borders, Cirno can freeze things ect.<br><br> <br><br>I called bullshit when Sakuya survived being punched by the world. Sakuya is a normal human girl, if The World hit her like that her head would fly off. Sakuya would win though because she would simply fly firing danmaku at DIO. Also, Danmaku should hurt The World to because they harm the soul rather than the users.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All we need is Sailor Yasuho for this to be the best game ever.</br>  <br>I'd take 200 dollars worth of DLC and a story mode written by the revived corpse of Ed Wood if it meant it not being arena fighter 3D trash.</br>  <br>JoJo isn't a Capcom fucking property. It's a manga and they can make whatever game they want, it doesn't need to be a conservative fighter just because Crapcum made one in the 90s.<br><br>Hell even then it was Capcom that made the first arena brawler with the VA game.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> this much bait <br>Go to bed Pesci.</br></br></br></br>  why must their always be hackers on a leaderboard i was all excited to get number 1 spot until three fucken niggers decided to hack and stole it from me  <br><br>You can download them pre-patched here - http://moriyashrine.weebly.com/.</br></br>  <br>My nigga</br>  I don't know jap.<br>How do I navigate the online menu in the demo?

No wonder it was Rohan that narrated PV2.</br></br>  <br>http://kanaquest.com/</br>  <br>Going by his stand's name, does Rohan possess the Eyes of Heaven?</br>  <br>Oh well, guess I should stop beating around the bush and learn.<br><br>Thanks anyway, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, the Door. The Eyes of Heaven belongs to Araki.</br>  <br>I'm betting he stabbed himself with an arrow like Kira and Eyes of Heaven is Heaven's Door pseudo-Requiem ability.</br>  <br>But Rohan is Araki, the only difference being that Araki is a lot more open about his love for Josuke.</br>  <br>Kana is nothing man. It's only like triple the amount of Latin alphabet characters. It's Kanji that starts going into the thousands.<br><br>Here's a book I used last year http://www.mediafire.com/view/skg4s<wbr>0z0cg69s72/Remembering_The_Kana_PAG<wbr>E_79.pdf don't mind the chapter number in the filename. Follow it word for word and you'll learn every kana by the end of the month.</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>That's why Josuke has the Dick of Heaven</br>  <br>Who has the Ass of Heaven, then?</br>  <br>ＤＩＯ</br>  <br>Josuke as well. Look at his curves.</br>  <br>Why is Josuke so handsome?</br>  How many of you aren't gay?  <br>None</br>  <br>I'm  Straights , really.</br>  <br><br>Just watch Namasensei. I learned kana in less than week. It was hard, but those 4 days worth of writing shit out has always stuck with me. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oZE<wbr>A54VJEdE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the most sexual aspect of his character is the fact that he has zippers over his nippers.<br><br><br>We're all faggots and little girls on /a/, you either like cock or you fuck off to /v/.</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VbB<wbr>9wpZww4o</wbr>  [ ]  <br>i'm not<br> unless it's DIO </br></br>  <br>I had an entire portfolio with characters and dakuten/handakuten organized. The only reason it took me so long is because I was doing only a few kana per day since I'm a fucking moron.<br><br>Thanks for the suggestion btw, does that channel do kanji as well?</br></br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=D-A<wbr>OVj04jjo</wbr>  [ ]<br>Hol shit, even stuffs like Dio vs Kars gets original lines, the fanservice will be even stronger than in ASB.<br><br> Anyone could translate what they're saying though ? </br></br></br>  <br>Very well said</br>  <br><br>About 50. He's not a video for a year now, I think he stopped. Probably the most valuable lessons are the grammer lessons and he teaches over 100 verbs, adjectives and nouns. PLus he teaches a bit of Osaka Ben too, which is a bonus.</br></br>  <br>I think Kars also says something about hamon warriors when fighting Jonathan.</br>  <br>Thank you anon. In return here's a good lowkey site for kanji https://www.wanikani.com/<br><br>It's still in closed beta but if you give them your email you can get in easily. They explain the strokes by number and include simple mnemonics as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What are the custom lines you're waiting for the most ? Damn, ASB had all the logical lines for characters of their own parts, but now they're pushing it even further, this game is going to be awesome.<br><br>I think this 3D 2vs2 thing is more adapted to Jojo's than a classic fighting game, as it allow for way more characters types like N'Doul and Petshop. This shit will be rad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've already heard the one I anticipated most, the Dio and JoJo teamup. I honestly did not expect them to use the rubgy dialogue.</br>  <br>holy shit jonathan knows kars' name?<br>unique story mode confirmed?</br></br>  <br>story mode was confirmed with the scans that confirmed kira (bowie, not kosaku)</br>  <br>I'm hoping the Pillar Men also have lines against other vampires like Vanilla Ice and ripple users like Zeppeli.<br><br>But I'm really looking forward to Oldseph's quotes against part 2 characters and Speedwagon. As well as more lines between Jojos. I want to see what Johnathan says to Johnny.<br><br>And protag/villain team quotes are probably gonna be interesting, too.<br><br><br>It kinda sucks that they don't have a unique dual attack but it's still cool.<br><br><br>Yes, it's confirmed. Being supervised by Araki himself, no less.<br><br>May involve free roaming around Morioh.

That shit ruined my wallet last time.</br></br>  <br>It's being done by Araki</br>  <br>man i'm hype for this shit<br>i would do anything for translations</br></br>  <br> Pairing Joseph with Speedwagon <br> Pairing Oldseph with Stroheim, Caesar and Josuke <br> Pairing DIO with Jonathan, Dio, Giorno and gay priest <br> Pairing Kira with Kosaku <br> Pairing Gyro with another Zeppeli <br> Pairing Gappy with Josuke <br>ALL THESE COMBOS<br>I WANT THEM ALL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm suspecting it's gonna be some kind of original stand that will put together all the protagonists and bad guy in the same world/time, if not with some kind of Grail war shit goal to add some plot. Just imagine the possibilities for the original teams in this story.</br>  <br>After Shadow Dio, New Kakyoin and Black Polnareff.</br>  <br> May involve free roaming around Morioh <br>This for me is the hypest thing. I've never even liked fighting games, but if CC2 is planning on doing a Naruto UNS style freeroam mode for every part this might as well be the best JoJo game ever for me.</br></br>  <br>literally who?</br>  <br>Not the same. Arabia Fats actually could work since N'Doul got in the game, except he's even shittier by himself and the Sun is fucking strong, as he can freely fly he use lasers. Also, he can hide himself using his machine.</br>  <br> all the crusaders are at the Cairo airport at the end <br> except for Kakyoin, who still dies just like his ending in HttF </br></br>  <br>jojo is about memes</br>  Godamnit Pixiv, stop with these comfy as fuck fanarts already, my heart can't take it.    <br>  HP and Diego are together for the whole plot. </br>   Rohan could've opened up Kira and erased his murderous tendencies.   <br> Araki teases a definitive answer to The World vs King Crimson. <br> Decides to not have them fight after all. </br></br>  <br>I don't see him forgetting Kira for killing Remi, neither she will. He killed way too much people.</br>  <br>They're done with SC characters besides DIO.</br>  Can anyone tell me the music plays during Dio's World (3), when Dio asks if Jotaro could see him? The intense violin stuff that plays when jotaro stares at him.  <br>There's no chance that Vanilla Ice isn't in the game. They already have assets from ASB too.</br>  <br>This looks pretty pretty.</br>  <br> Giorno finally meeting his dad <br> Entire Joestar family against a greater evil <br>This is gonna be great. Even better than Jorge Joestar and it's done by the creator to boot.</br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? By making Kira non-murderous, he could also make him feel especially guilty over killing Reimi and have him brought to justice. The only reason why Heaven's Door doesn't cut short Part 4 is because Rohan, like Okuyasu, is too much of an arrogant idiot to use his stand properly.<br><br> I decided to look up It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia the other day because of these images, I'm already nearing the end of season 3. </br></br></br>   everyone is suddenly hype for EoH <br><br>what happened</br></br>  <br> it's done by the creator to boot. <br>It's supervised by him, which is likely just a nice way of saying that they run it by him and he shrugs and says "Sure, do whatever you want"</br></br>  trying to make list of upgrade stands<br><br>Hierophant Green &gt; Stone Free<br> (Can extend way further and has projectiles vs. Ghost Punch) <br><br>Cream &gt; The Hand<br> (larger deleting surface area and protects user) <br><br>High Priestess &gt; Metallica / Tomb of Boom<br> (can control far more metal and at far greater distances) <br><br>Oyecomova &gt; Killer Queen (no Bite the dust)<br> (Make thousands of bombs in any medium vs. just one on a physical solid surface) <br><br>In a Silent way &gt; Echos Act 2<br> (can create multiple sound contructs and have them move vs. Just one that has to be written on something) <br><br>Civil War &gt; The Lock<br> (can revive, make zombies, and weapons via guilt vs. just a dumb fucking lock) <br><br>Goo Goo Dolls &gt; Little Feet<br> (shrinking radius vs. having to cut someone to shrink them) <br><br>Aqua Necklace &gt; Geb<br> (can be any liquid and size of person vs. modest sized puddle of water only that is only a hand) <br><br>Tohth &gt; Epithet<br> (10 minute vs. 10 seconds) <br><br>Crazy Diamond &gt; Sethan<br> (restores anything to previous state vs. just living things) <br><br>Atum &gt; Osiris<br> (truth vision, levitation, and able to touch souls where Osiris can't.) <br><br>White album &gt; Horus<br> (Absolute zero and invincibility that horus doesn't) <br><br>Kraft Work &gt; Sex Pistols &gt; Manhattan Transfer<br> (more potential kinetic manipulation and large physical body vs. 6 tiny ones vs. just 1) <br><br>Notorious B.I.G &gt; Yellow Temperance<br> (can absorb inorganic objects, possess people, and isn't brought down by user) <br><br>Highway to hell &gt; Lovers<br> (can't stop stand on the inside) <br><br>Sticky Fingers &gt; Nut King Call<br> (ghostpunch and speed as well as being able to access areas in-between objects where nut king can only loosen things) <br><br>Star Platinum &gt; The World<br> (Star Finger, higher precision and endurance stats, can better learning as it learned time stop in only 20 minutes of fighting over 4 months for the World.) <br><br>Purple Haze &gt; Green Day<br> Can activate virus anywhere without altitude gimmick.

Every other character has been a good conversion from ASB so far but Kak feels really strange.    <br><br>Charts mean nothing because Araki is a fucking idiot</br></br>  <br>Kars has it much easier to go Ultimate Lifeform now.<br>Even if the buffs aren't as good.<br>I bet it's much easier to do the words now.</br></br></br>  <br>Possibly.</br>  <br>Kakyoin seems to be all about set-ups.<br>Flood everything with the mini barriers and hope your partner's AI goes for the dumbass that steps into them.</br></br>  <br>Thats Star Platinum The World<br><br>Check Star Platinum from SD bruv.<br><br>Manga panel says the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the same stand nigga Star Platinum: The World is just a distinction in the name</br>    <br>Watch them make the words physical so you'll have to collect them around the map like the corpse parts in ASB.</br>  <br>It gets much worse, in my opinion. I see Stardust Crusaders as the worst part of JJBA in general (which is still pretty good to watch, tho).</br>  <br> On top of that SP learned to stop time in 20 minutes while it took the world 4 months. <br><br>Learning something by copying is easier than finding it out on your own.</br></br></br>  Anyone else happy about no DLC?<br><br>CC2 is actually doing a pretty good job with the game.</br></br>  /fit/ here, admiring these physiques. which arc do i read first?  <br>SP = Jotaro and the stand in their prime<br><br>SP: TW = Jotaro and the stand after not doing shit for 20 years.<br><br>Joseph = Goofy ripple master who can fuck anyone up in his prime<br><br>Oldseph = aged ripple user who hasn't done shit in 50 years.<br><br>Star Platinum the World is an evolution of Star Platinum.

The series stops with the bulk by Part 5.<br><br> Part 2 would really impress you though. </br></br></br>  <br>how do you copy willing yourself to stop time?</br>  <br>There could still be DLC.<br>But you won't have to pay for it.</br></br>  <br>Marginal improvement. They're very clearly using imported models, but the cel-shading is new and looks good. It could be leagues better if UNS4 is any indication of CC2's strengths.</br>  <br>Free DLC is synonymous to updates.</br>  <br>The game has a weird filter on the characters that makes them look not as good as the renders imply.<br><br>Still looks better, though.</br></br></br>  I couldn't find any video that showcases Kars transforming into the ultimate life form in EoH, is it even available in the demo ?  <br>youre evil?</br>  Why Dio is so edgy? Not even all the bad childhoods in the world can make a person this edgy.  <br>It is. I'll make a video for you.</br>  <br><br>What about the alliasing ? Felt it was the main problem back then.</br></br>  <br>Yeah.<br>It's not as impressive or game-changing a change as in ASB, though. It just changes a few of his moves and gives him a flying mode.</br></br>  Does EoH have a release date yet?  <br>Wait, no need after all.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XqL<wbr>tEf_3tqg</wbr>  [ ]<br>Found one, it's at 3:30.</br></br></br>  <br>  guys keeps spamming light mode attacks and wins quickly <br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br><br>He uses it more in the second round. What the hell with the tentacles coming out of the ground ? Anyway, seems like he gets another ultimate in this one. now I want to see see GER's and MIH's.</br></br>  <br>Part 4 should have been an endless SoL.</br>  <br>It's a stand thingy.</br>  <br>Shit, I made one anyway https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LvY<wbr>UTRJZnYI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>All that's listed is 2015. I'm personally thinking September though with the way ASB went.</br>  One of the things I'm finding weird about the demo is that some combo finishers only seem to activate if you don't connect any hit before it.<br><br>I can't pull Jonathan's Luck &amp; Pluck double slash if he hits the enemy with any jab beforehand. If he does he just finishes with Scarlet Overdrive.<br><br>It's a bit weird.</br></br></br></br>  <br>would you say it's bizarre?</br>  Has anyone translated the control screen from EoH yet?  <br>Yes.<br>Trying to hit with Luck &amp; Pluck almost feels like some sort of bizarre adventure.</br></br>  <br>ah, and since you're playing as Jonathan, could you call it JoJo's Bizarre adventure?</br>  where's part 4  <br><br> High Priestess &gt; Metallica <br>They are completely different,Metallica deals with magnetism while high priestess manipulates metals,and Metallica is far stronger. High priestess can't control iron inside the body which is a huge fucking deal.</br></br></br>  <br>ah, and since you're playing as Jonathan and the attack draws blood, could you call it JoJo's Bizarre adventure: phantom blood?</br>  <br>Definitely.<br>Man, that sounds like a cool name for a comic of some sort.</br></br>  <br>Some of the enemys you could use it on are phantoms of sorts, though with the sound of that attack it seems like he has some sort of Tendency to Battle</br>   tfw he won't be in EoH   <br>The heroes who battle phantoms that can only walk under the stars could be called the Stardust Crusaders.</br>  <br> Implying <br>If fucking Mariah is in the game Santana will be too,they are going full anime with maybe 4-5 characters for every other part</br></br>  <br> 10 meters, only manipulates iron, only controls a small amount <br><br> able to control the entire ocean floor at 7 meters and have a tiny remote stand from 40+ meters away. Can be any metal. <br><br>How is it even a competition. High Priestess destorys Metallica. Way better metal manipulator.</br></br></br></br></br>  Has anyone hacked demo #1 so we can play as Diego yet? You know it's fucking easy as hell to do.  <br>Yes, its like they are Unbreakable gems, maybe Diamonds</br>  <br>It truly is a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is not Crash.</br>  jojo is gay  So the demo is PS4 only? Fucking cunts, I need something to revive my PS3  <br>someones angry</br>  <br> Diamond is not Crash <br>Get out</br></br>  <br> people comparing a long distance offensive stand to a silent assassination stand <br>It's like Emperor vs Sex Pistols all over again</br></br>  <br>With the golden wind at their back, helping them cross that stone ocean, like some sort of steel ball run, in order to be more than JoJos, to be JoJoLions.</br>  <br>yeah, I want to emerald splash things</br>  <br>people thought those would be a good vs fight?</br>  <br> destroying your body in the inside is not better at killing than controlling outside metal </br>  <br>It's a fucking completely different stand based on magnetism ,it makes no sense calling it an upgrade.</br>  <br><br>We're talking purely as a stand, not how they were used. <br><br>And Emperor is superior to sex pistols as a stand<br><br>You need a gun and ammo for sex pistols, you don't for emperor.<br><br>You can control the bullet any which direction with emperor, you can only do it 6 times with pistols. <br><br>Hell pistols isn't even a gun stand, its a kinectic change one. Mista just used it like that. Without a gun all he has are 6 little pricks who won't listen to him if he doesn't feed them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah there was a whole whining that Sex Pistols was the better gun stand even though both clearly had way different functions.<br><br>You use Sex Pistols in a gun fight across the street, you use Emperor when assassinating the president.</br></br></br>  <br> 10 meters <br> Iron only <br><br>Get 10 meters away, and Midler wins instantly. Just use a metal that isn't iron and Ristto is fucked. I mean at 7 meters she made a giant face. At 11 she could still make a golem to crush him easily.</br></br></br></br>  <br>truly it's like a Destiny in their Blood, it runs like a Bloody stream, they will Stand Proud, untill the End of the World</br>  JoJo makes everything better, even shoujo manga.  <br> 10 meters <br> Get 10 meters away, and Midler wins instantly <br>Yeah by that logic Midler wins against every single short ranged stand ever.</br></br></br>  <br>good, thought people were that retarded to put them in matchups</br>  never ever  <br>From Jonathan Joestar's youth, to his proud lineage, his heritage to the future, shining diamonds that never crash. A golden heritage.</br>  <br>Yes, truly the destiny of the Joestar family is a Roundabout one</br>  <br>They may have to Walk Like an Egyptian around their troubles, but by the end of the day they always catch the Last Train Home.</br>  <br>truly a mighty power Ripples through their blood, and they always Stand up</br>  <br>Oh we had Made in Heaven vs King Crimson too.<br><br>That too ended up in a massive bitchfest.</br></br></br>  <br>But nothing can Beat Green Grass of home and GER right?<br><br>Both of them have zeroing powers that cancel anything.</br></br></br>   C'mon Josuke, hide the weed before Kira comes!   guys i think jojo is gay  <br>This is all wrong. Pic related is the proper Morioh-cho Boys.</br>  <br>How could you come to that conclusion?</br>  This anime speaks to me.  <br>you should just kill yourself then, no need to burden others</br>  <br>On a spiritual level</br>  What does it say?  <br>It tells me I don't need to feel bad about not having a job and being 26 because I can be like Umaru-chan! She's cool and cute.

Outward everyone thinks I'm a well-mannered, nice and reliable normal dude. But then I'm home become a degenerate.</br>  <br> remove subs <br> crop background <br> PROMOTIONS </br></br></br>    <br>Because they don't want to portray NEETs right in anime, it'd be too real for their audience.</br>  <br>There's a NEET in this anime?</br>  <br>no.</br>  <br>When's he finally gonna fuck his little sister's friend? <br><br>I'm serious, he'd get the cutest fucking girl ever and he'd be sticking it to that selfish bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah cause it's really glorifying that lifestyle isn't it. Except the fact she's not opting out of life. She's athletic and does well in school. <br><br>Japs already have a bunch of people that work too much and never relax, maybe showing them something that has someone who can work hard when it's needed but slack off and be happy when they have that opportunity.</br></br></br>  Would you?  <br>Even though her happiness means being a burden to basically everyone around her? <br>Doing well in school =/= doing well in life. Outside of school, she's practically a vegetable.</br></br>  <br>Her happiness is a burden to her brother. Who guess what, works too hard and rarely relaxes. That's about it. <br><br>Also she's what a 14 year old girl? School is pretty damn important, what do you think she should be doing extra?</br></br></br>  <br> what is NHK </br>  <br>I'm not saying hobbies aren't important, but acting like you're 5? Constantly throwing tantrums to get what you want? Basically having an umbilical cord attached to your computer or television? That's in no way healthy, and it certainly shouldn't be panned off as "cute" or "endearing"</br>  <br>high-functioning autism is still autism</br>  <br>Feed her?<br>Her mouth is drooling, she must be very hungry.</br></br>  <br>Well, she's been having some character developments in the manga, so I guess this is kind of normal for teenagers. Heck even we used to leech on our family at some points of our lives (before adults anyway), didn't we?</br>  <br>I don't remember screaming at my parents for video games, no.</br>  <br>Some kids are good, some kids throw a tantrum just to get what they want (then get bored anyway), Umaru is just one of them. But with her intelligent and friends around, I doubt she would leech her brother for the rest of her life.</br>  <br>It's not exactly like she's an endearing character though when she's in that mode. Cute, maybe, but that's just the way of modern anime. <br><br>The girl does the best in her class, she's athletic enough to beat a swim team member at swimming, she has friends. <br><br>What she does outside of school, while immature, is to an extent fine, if her brother allows her to get what she wants by acting like that, then it's as much his fault for allowing her to live that way. To her it could be a norm. <br><br>I'm not saying it is healthy, but it appears that she'll still succeed in life and more than likely grow out of the stuff she does now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5's speak truth</br>  <br><br>Or be in Australia. We get government giveouts easily. Especially if you say you're abo.</br></br>  <br>again though, the character is being paraded around as cutesy and "charming". At least in No Life, No Game (equally awful) they didn't sugarcoat how much of a degenerate the main characters were.<br><br>I'm not claiming the brother isn't at fault- it takes an enabler to create that kind of terrible person. <br>I might have liked the show if they firmly established her wanting to get better by episode 2. Then I could forgive what she does a bit more because she'd actively be trying to be a better person in the background. At least then I have something to root for and be invested in. But the baseline the show sets overstays its welcome waaaay too long.<br><br>That anon here, if only truth were so easily defined as quints.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   all these normie losers being butthurt because they have to slave away working all day while i get to sit at home doing things I enjoy while living very comfortably  <br><br>Haha, sucks to be you losers.</br></br>  <br> If this is how she unwinds she will not be ready for adult life at all<br>Spoiled children are messed up in the head</br></br>  <br><br><br>Nobody is stupid enough to think this shit is acceptable. It's a fucking anime, just because you find it cute in the anime doesn't mean you think it's acceptable in real life. <br><br>Not to mention her character is literally impossible. Being perfect at sports and getting 100% in everything while also lazing around at home. She does study a lot, but we hardly see her play sport.<br><br>You're taking this shit way too seriously. This is a comedy anime. Have you read Hoozuki Aneki? It's similar in it's execution</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Penta speaks truth<br> Check em' </br></br>    <br>welcome to the NHK</br>  <br> Trying too hard to fit in </br>  <br>That they even try to make this behavior seem cute is disgusting. That people would find this behavior cute, in any context, is disturbing.</br>  <br>Not enough dank memes</br>  <br> stop liking what I don't like <br>I don't even like Umaru but fuck your retarded mentality.</br></br>  Best sub?  <br> just because its cute in anime doesn't mean it's acceptable in real life <br><br>Yeah look at gay couples and lesbian couples, and harems and pedophiles. All portrayed very purely and not at all acceptable in the real world.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to eviscerate that thing.</br>  <br><br><br>And others in this thread: <br>Most otaku think this not only to be acceptable, but are outraged how some would think this (minus having a big brother) is not how one should live. No exaggeration here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please learn what an otaku is you newfag.<br><br>Otaku =/= Hikki</br></br></br>  <br>I am absolute not saying "stop liking things I don't like". I'm actually ASKING you to invite me to your way of thinking. So far, I haven't been presented with adequate persuasion. I'm not so naive to think you shouldn't enjoy what you enjoy- rather I'm begging you to convince me that I'm wrong about this media.</br>  <br><br>They just never grew up. <br><br>Really they never have to go through growth in their personality because they go out of their way to avoid hardship. That means criticism and ploys to make them actually do things or think new things usually go out the window. <br><br>They never go out of their comfort zone, they never challenge themselves, they refuse to do anything new. <br><br>They're outraged, but not in the way that someone proactive would be outraged. They're not aiming to do anything about it, they're OFFENDED that someone would think to do something like that. They get defensive because if they accept that to be the norm. Someone might force them to do something. <br><br>It's what a lot of people on this board do. /a/ has a lot of people not willing to change even if it's just small stuff, it speaks volumes of your maturity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are pretty far gone.<br>You remind me of my Parents saying that gta makes children violent</br></br>  Is there no onein this thread which enjoys this show without some SWJ bullshit  <br>I don't understand how you equate my saying "this character is a degenerate" with "watching this show makes you a degenerate". I never said that, and if I somehow led you to believe that I did I sincerely apologize because that was not my intent.<br><br>I'm actually at odds with SJW.

Okay, wait for episode 4, now fuck off.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128283603 <br><br>They would look at your pics and see that you are just a filthy gaijin. Therefore your opinion is irrelevant</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128283603 <br> tumblr filename <br>So these are the kind of people who dislike Super</br></br>  Does anyone want to talk about death battle.<br><br>This new episode has to be the worst one they've given out.<br><br>First of all in their previous death battle(in which they got DBZ's scaling wrong) a SSJ4 Goku did damage to Superman almost killing him, while in this one a SSJG Goku couldn't do shit to Superman. Fuck the SSj4 even lasted longer.<br><br>Second of all if Superman even wanted to kill Goku he can't because of his God form, you have to be a literal god to damage another god. (r-right)<br><br>Third of all Zenkai boosts, every time Goku is defeated or dies his powerlevel increases dramatically to match his enemy.<br><br>and so on.<br><br>Superman is probably stronger, but holy fuck was this lazy. It was 10 minute mash up of shit with no data, no stats, just to slap DBZ fans. They also used like 10 different fucking forms of superman I think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   These mad as fuck Z fans   <br>i dropped after the first episode full of filler</br>   DBZ fanbase <br><br>Hey guys, Blackened Fist here toooooday.</br></br>  <br>Fuck can't Goku just blow up the fucking sun and render him useless? What the fuck are these guys thinking. Goku could literally teleport to a different galaxy teleport its sun and bait Superman or some shit</br>  <br>Also <br><br>Superman<br> pure of heart </br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of those episodes were anime-only filler. The arc was pretty short in the manga. Really tightly fit into the story.</br>  <br>We are bound to get fight because, well, Dragon Ball. Beerus vs Goku Round 1 should be either next episode or the one after that. <br><br>That said, since they don't have to pad things out to avoid overtaking the manga this time, there probably won't be multi episode fights. <br><br>At least not like before. Maybe 2 eps for important fights and 3 for final boss.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Superman is like a battery, he doesn't automatically run out of power once the sun's down. Also he survived a supernova once, which isn't exactly canon anymore but still.</br>  <br> tfw i prefered to watch Death Battle Live! than the new DBS episode <br><br>Isn't it sad? I'm not even bothered that i missed a new episode of a NEW dragon ball series, and this comes from a big DB fanboy, it gets to show how bad super is. Anyways, the Goku vs Superman 2 outcome was pretty obvious, Superman is pretty much the most overpowered character ever, plus screwattack seems to dislike DB for some reason.</br></br></br>  Why do people take Dragon ball so seriously? It's a funny show filled with puns and people blowing each other up with energy beams every now and then, jesus christ. You fags can't enjoy anything for what it is.<br><br>Also, I'm sure femwhiss is going to be named after some alcoholic drink, like Brand or Vod or some shit.</br></br>  <br>Is right <br><br><br>Is a fucking retard</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to the revealed episode titles...<br>Episode 4 is gonna be Pilaf and gang trying to steal the Dragon Balls.<br>Episode 5 is gonna be Goku vs. Beerus.<br><br>We'll probably get the BoG plot through episode 6, then the Resurrection F plot for 7-12.</br></br></br></br></br>  so...Whis definitely likes Beerus  <br> I don't like it therefore it's so bad </br>  At the risk of some idiot calling out "muh serious" nonsense, I'd just like to say that I hate Beerus and Whis' designs. <br><br>I like the idea of an alien Egyptian God, but he's a fucking stick figure. He's worse than Kid Buu, and borderline GT bad. Dude needs a surprise overly buff hulking Anubis form or something, even if it's only used once or twice.<br><br>As for Whis, get the guy a ruler. He's as straight as a slinky.<br><br>This series is supposed to go back to the fun adventures of Dragon Ball, right? If so, I hope we get some interesting villains. The reused BoG duo are not very interesting at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This<br><br>Supes doesn't have a pure heart :^)<br><br> false god </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the Frieza thing will take a bit longer, with this thing about Goku and Vegeta achieving Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan and stuff, Pan being born and so</br>  <br> Strongest guy in the universe is a gay butler who loves his hairless cat <br>I'm okay with this.</br></br>  <br><br>He could just teleport Superman to an area with a red sun. He'd rapidly start losing his powers and Goku could gain the upper hand.</br></br>  <br><br> Superman <br> Not Pure of heart </br></br></br>  <br>now I want an episode where Beerus sees Whis naked</br>  <br>Dude, it's Toriyama. The less impressive you seem the more impressive you actually are. <br><br>It's his thing. That's why Vegeta is manlet while Nappa and Raditz are big, strong guys.</br></br></br>  I'm REALLY fucking tired of the english fansubbers for this show. They are slow as FUCK and are generally shit in quality.  <br> i like to eat shit <br><br>That's what i read.</br></br></br>  <br>No. fuck off.<br><br>We don't give a fuck about autistic powerlevel discussions</br></br></br>  any subs...? Spanish or english... anything...  <br> he'll do whatever he fucking wants <br>This.<br><br>Its only DB in name so far. Remember Nagato from Haruhi got her own show and it wasnt anything like the original? Well, thats whats happening here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That Superman is dead and comic book writers killed him.<br><br>Now he leaves the Earth alone so he can lift in peace and lets Lois get mindraped so he can protect his secret identity.</br></br></br>  <br>Or Frieza, Kaioshin, Kid Buu</br>  THICK OUTLINES  <br>How about waiting like everyone else?</br>  <br>Says the one enjoying Death Battle Live!</br>  <br>That's a good point. Man, if they really go that route, depending on how long it takes to fill in all the gaps, we might not get genuinely new plotlines until after the second cours.</br>  THIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK  <br>I didn't say I need 'em now... all I did was ask if there were any.... :|</br>  <br>http://jkanime.net/dragon-ball-supe<wbr>r/3/</wbr></br>  <br> Mai doesn't have her makeup anymore <br>Instant improvement, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>spanish subs are already out but they are bad</br>  <br> Does anyone want to talk about death battle. <br><br>There's nothing to talk about, from the onset they weren't going to let Superman lose. Not with a new movie coming out, especially not to Goku. Which is exactly why they cherry-picked Superman's more recent feats from multiple authors, while ignoring the laughable embarrassing losses each version of modern-age Superman has had (see, Batman).<br><br>The fact that they seriously tried to argue that Goku was a 'normal man' compared to Supes is retarded enough and that 'God energy' was no different than normal energy, when the entire point of 'God energy' is that non-gods can't sense.<br><br>Lastly, the central argument for Superman (this time) is that his potential is limitless and it's fine for various authors to throw in whatever bullshit power they want, while Death Battle will willfully ignore anything that detracts from Superman's power. <br><br>It doesn't matter what new form Goku has, there was never any real effort from Screw Attack to really research any of Dragonball's new material it or properly put it into scale vs. this mishmash of Supes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THANX A TON! mate! LOve you!</br>  <br> What else is DB known for? <br>Comedy adventure</br></br>  <br>Well to be fair they can expand the fights against Frieza's henchmen, giving Gohan and Piccolo more time to shine</br>  <br>Going by the manga we should be seeing Champa and Fem Whis in episode 4 or 5. Even if we don't a new plot line right away the seeds are probably going to be planted early on.</br>  <br>I seriously can't tell if you're retarded or baiting</br>  <br>Subs always out at the usual place why do you people keep asking and waiting for an answer instead of running a search that last at maximum 1 second?</br>  <br>Ignore it. He is american, a good part of them only watched from the Saiyan arc onwards.</br>  <br><br>that stupid reasoning screw attack used for superman's strength was debunked years ago<br><br>quoting from an actual dc comics fan site:<br><br> If Superman could lift infinite weight he would not have needed the help of Wonder Woman and Kyle Rayner to lift Spectre (JLA The Spectre Soul War 1) <br> If Superman could lift infinite weight he would not have needed the help of Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter and Kyle Rayner to move the Earth (JLA 75) <br> If Superman could lift infinite weight he would not have needed to sun-dip in order to move Warworld (Action Comics 782) <br> Spectre was heavier than the book as it took three Justice League members to move him <br> The Earth was also heavier than the book and Spectre as it took four Justice League members to move it <br>Therefore Superman did not lift infinite weight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> here's nothing to talk about, from the onset they weren't going to let Superman lose. Not with a new movie coming out, especially not to Goku. <br><br>Well, how else are they going to get gullible powerlevelfags to come back and watch Goku vs Superman 3 after Super ends and the Justice League.<br><br>The fact that anyone is taking Screw Attack's Death Battles seriously, much less officially, after they used fucking GT the first time is sad enough, that there are people who seriously getting upset over it is fucking dumb, especially since they've made no qualms about how much they hate anime/manga shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  So Supreme Kaio-Sama revealed that Beerus destruction has NO MEANING.<br>He does it because he wants to.</br>  <br><br>Please get out of here if you're going to discuss that shit.<br><br>Capeshit goes to /co/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look, the main flaw with death battle is that they go by feats. The problem is that feats are literally based on whether or not the author gives a shit about versus battles. Superman has a billion writers, half of them are fanboys, so his feats are obviously going to be better. Goku has one writer who makes Dragonball for comedy purposes and can't even remember who half the characters are.</br>  <br>wasn't it stated in the movies that he did it to keep balance or some shit?</br>  <br>I don't get the whole Superman vs. Goku thing. Goku's not anywhere near as iconic in Japan as Superman is here.<br><br>They should do Superman vs. Ultraman instead.  Also, Spider-man vs. Kamen Rider 1. </br></br></br>  <br>the movies are no longer canon</br>  <br> Which is exactly why they cherry-picked Superman's more recent feats from multiple authors, while ignoring the laughable embarrassing losses each version of modern-age Superman has had (see, Batman). <br><br>The fact that they used joke Freeza's VA made about Golden Freeza to hand-wave how much more powerful post-Buu Dragon Ball characters had become is all the evidence anyone needs to see that Screw Attack is still completely full of shit.<br><br>That's about as stupid as them making an argument around the Funimation version of dubbed 'superman' Goku in a 'serious' battle (which they also did).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>he IS keeping the balance<br>his job is simple, he has to destroy things, he decides what he destroys</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, just not beerus.<br>They say it in this episode at the beginning.<br><br>Young Kaio Shin says <br>"but doesn't destuction has a meaning to exist?"<br>And old man says "Not beerus-sama destruction, he does it on a whim"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not how Instant Transmission works.</br>  <br><br> That segment where they went out of their way to shit all over the Wizard's Goku vs Superman battle just to act like their shit don't stink. <br><br>I'm a capefag, but goddamn that was tacky.</br></br></br></br>  Because toriyama and toei's original intent and writing and animation direction wasn't there.<br><br><br>In short, toriyama prefered to do comedy mangas and wanted to quit after the freezer arc, but his higher ups said no.<br><br><br>Now I suspect he has more free reign, and the retards there dont understand simple logic such as why dbz was popular.<br><br>It was not popular because of its humor, the movies are obviously the best since its no filler or long drawn out scenes.<br><br><br>Also, remember that the original company that animated it either do not have the same people or went batshit insane.<br>Again, see the movie for evidence of that, the fighting choreography is incredible bad, let alone for that company who made one of the best fighting choreography in all of anime history. No matter if its not the best, its one of the best. Simply compare them in the 90s, they were kings.<br><br><br>Now its like a reverse symptom of the kenshin author, now he just creates shit due to editors, while toriyama needs editors so he do not write anymore humor anime or filler shit like this.<br>At one point he must have liked drawing fighting manga, but felt bored after a while.<br>Some people like a hobby for a bit and then gets tired of it, sad fact.<br>In short, anything else in the future thats made by toriyama thats not controlled by higher ups will be a fuck up due to the reasons I stated.<br><br><br>Dbz had its glory times, the only way it can become good again is for someone to legaly force him to draw original dragon ball z related manga again against his will and he better make sure it was close to the original. Of course due to human rights laws that will never happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its dragonball m8, not dbz</br>  <br><br>Naaaahhh... current Supes chills out by working with children, helping disaster zones and even with his identity exposed and his power reduced to Spiderman levels: fighting monsters that are above him in power and convincing warlords not to destroy the Earth.<br><br>Face it, Supes is just a good guy</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Americans are stupid. They are like magpies. They see something shiny or explosive and they start screaming like monkeys.</br></br>  <br>Yet, quite a few people seem to like Super.</br>  I just noticed there's no interactions between Roshi and Vegeta.<br><br>Vegeta getting mad because the geezer touches bulma would be awesome</br></br>  <br>Modern animation is shit<br><br>Toriyama is out of ideas so is just rehashing BoG with slice of life BS that sells in Japan today</br></br></br>   generic moe shit in muh DBZ   <br>i think i've only ever seen one interaction between them when roshi hands him pron mags and vegeta just throws it back at his face</br>  Would you guys really be satisfied if Goku wins but not against the strongest canon version of Superman?  <br>I like it because it is SOL and more akin to Dragon Ball. Eat a stiffy haters.</br>  <br>Eh, it's fine. Some people just seem to want their power levels and multi episode fights which is hilarious since that's the same thing everyone complained about DBZ.</br>  <br>Uh, but it's been confirmed that we're getting a new plot where they fight warriors from another Universe and search for the Super Dragon Balls.<br><br>DBS is gonna be 100 episodes.</br></br></br>  Is it true that the only reason Americans like DBZ is because they made Goku edgier in their localization?  <br>Edgier how?</br>  <br>If by edgier you mean less of a goofy grandma faggot, then yes.</br>  Best girl appears next episode  That picture looks like a zone flash and he's about to fuck Bulma with his tentacle dicks.  <br>God, fuck that voice. I can't believe they didn't change it once he became an adult.</br>  <br>And the shit soundtrack</br>  <br>Goku is not supposed to sound like a manly macho man. <br>He's not Kenshiro.<br><br>He's a manchildren</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't I still sound like a kid then?</br>  <br>Because you're not an Alien from a fictional manga?</br>  <br>Wait, they changed the original soundtrack?<br>And then they wonder why people hate Americans.</br></br>  <br>How can he be a manchild if he's an alien?<br><br>your arguments dont even make any sense smh</br></br></br>  <br>Toei is well known for being a shithead to work with. They probably charged a shit ton more for it to come with the original music and since anime was not popular at the time, they just decided to go with the cheaper option.</br>  <br><br>The opposite actually. <br><br>They took away his defining character trait, that he doesn't fight to protect the world, but for the joy of fighting and to advance his own skill, and doesn't kill villains because he wants them to train so he can fight them again. <br><br>In the English dub he's a typical moralfag super hero who doesn't kill villains because it would "make him just like them". <br><br>Also the soundtrack is replaced with dumb techno shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aliens can't be manchildren <br>Racist.</br></br>  <br>English https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gUu<wbr>zYvTItNk</wbr>  [ ]<br>Be thankful I found one without 16 talking, his voice is disgusting<br><br>Japanese https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fdW<wbr>Sxmut_Fg</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Latam https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BHI<wbr>oRrPdNJI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The piano in the english one is pretty good</br>  <br>That doesn't explain why they used the original soundtrack everywhere else in the world though.</br>  Still no background animal people.<br><br>I will point this out every episode until Toriyama remembers at least one.</br></br>  <br>Funimation wanted to market it very specifically to American children, and Americanize it.</br>  <br>Japan rarely changes voice actors for characters. <br><br>Usually they have to die first... which is what happened for Lupin, IRRC.<br><br>Characters who got their voice actors chosen when they were kids tend to suffer when their characters grow older but their voice actor remains the same. It's a thing there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No. Americans liked DBZ because this shit was way more awesome than any action cartoons we had at the time</br></br>  <br>This is a Superman that sounds actually interesting.</br>  <br>They were obviously all evil so they didn't get resurrected after the Buu saga.</br>  <br>so because of the fights.<br><br>I will never understand, why DBZ instead of DB first? Are you people retarded? I'm seriously asking.<br><br>It's like starting Naruto from Naruto Shippuden or One Piece after the time-skip</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They actually tried doing the first few episodes of DB first. Shitty timeslot most likely killed its chances.</br>  <br> Why hasn't anyone started fighting yet? <br>are you familiar with how DBZ used to fuck around with its viewers? <br><br>it was for that shit that DBZ was dropped by so much people, expecting something different is plain stupidity.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>most people remember these parts about DBZ: <br><br>what they don't remember is the fucking retarded side characters, awkward silences, and general tomfoolery</br></br></br></br>  No episode next week because Fuji TV being a shit.  <br>I'm aware, but it's still the dumbest thing ever.</br>  The Ginyu Force sure got high ratings.  <br>can source?</br>  <br> why DBZ instead of DB first? <br>DB is way too different and you technically skip it.DB is better in every aspect tho</br></br>    moe SoL dbz <br>amazing</br>  <br>Disgusting*</br>  <br>No it's not you fucking retard.<br><br>It's the same thing, it was different in the first 20 chapters or so.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck no the original dragon ball is way different than post picolo jr</br>  <br> Mai doesn't have her makeup anymore <br><br>That's because she's a child in that shot, along with the Dog.</br></br></br>    <br>is that furry porn?</br>   no sexy Chi-Chi in a bikini <br> no sexy Bulma in a bikini <br> no sexy 18 in a bikini <br><br>They had one job, and they blew it.</br></br></br></br>  episode 3 when?  <br>never.<br>it was canceled</br></br>  <br><br>I'm with you, bro.<br><br>I'm enjoying this way too much.</br></br></br></br>  Thoughts?  <br>fuck off</br>  So the movie officially started in this episode. <br><br>Good.</br></br>   Karera's new socks <br><br>Crazy Diamond Dick is Unbreakable.</br></br>  <br>fuck off with shilling your dying channel</br>  <br>this image looks like that one furry cartoon where one of the animals is shitting on a hotdog bun the other is about to eat</br>  subs out yet?  <br><br>Beerus is cat.</br></br>  tfw waiting for moonlighters to sub<br><br>come on fucks<br><br>god damn it I actually wish this was crunchy licensed. at least we'd have it.<br><br>that one goku/chichi shipper reporting in</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a pleb</br>  ScrewAttack are a bunch of capeshit western shills  <br>I already dropped it.

I don't know what are you even talking about, the new designs are a breath of fresh air, especially Whis.</br>  <br>If you dislike SoL Dragonball, you are the most cancerous cancer</br>  <br>That's just the pot calling the kettle black.<br><br> You are cancer for not liking what i like <br> Stop disliking what i like <br><br>moe SoL DB is the worst kind.<br>Not to mention, DB was okay SoL. This is post Lucky-Star K-on Konata Haruhi SoL bullshit, with forced japshit jokes that appeal to none, excluding the bottom-feeders of course.<br><br>If this shit keeps on, i'm not watching anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your loss, I'll be enjoying ice cream shenanigans</br>  are the subs from [inert] legit?  <br>dling now, will let you know</br>  <br><br>Episode 1: Kids want to get gift and bump into monster<br>Episode 2: Warrior prince goes on vacation and doesn't like it because he wants to surpass his rival<br><br>not seen episode 3 but you're clearly dumb if you don't understand any context or jokes. Besides, it's like a 9am Sunday kids cartoon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Aren't they joke subs?</br></br>  <br>watching any DB SHIT</br>  Upload to mega if you manage to finish that damn slow inert torrent.  <br>I got the jokes. But i cringed way harder tha n iwanted to, because of the forced japshit nature of it all. I liked the Videl parts.<br><br>If the jokes actually fit into the DB "lore", if you even can call it that at all. For example, why waste half an episode fighting with a giant snake, when you could just lift it into the air, blast it into orbit - it would only take a few seconds. Oh wait, because it's filler.<br><br>The manga adaptation is promo material to watch the animu, and the animu, since it has no source material just some guidelines, makes up all kinds of horrid filler japshit jokes.<br><br>100 episodes of this without any good fights, and i'm going to get flashbacks of Naruto post sasuke retrieval or the entirity of Bleach fillers.<br><br>I love how you attack me instead of addressing the argument.<br> 9am sunday kids cartoon <br>The creators are fucking aware non-9 year olds watched it. Hell, there are entire generations that grew up with DB, everything included.<br><br>I'm one of those older fans. How hard would it be to be a bit more lore-fitting, sensible?<br><br>Oh, and still no animal folk.<br>Episode 2 Elder Kai's animation was plain disgusting with the nonmoving moustache.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't this a Japanese toddler to 11 year old child cartoon series?</br></br>  <br> and i'm going to get flashbacks of Naruto post sasuke retrieval <br><br> watching Naruto </br></br></br>  <br><br>As said, the creators are fucking aware of it all - not only 9 yearolds watch it. That alone should be reason to be appealing to all ages that care instead.<br><br>No, we gotta make it more childish and even stupider. Let's make more filler with Satan, Buu being hungry, Beerus being hungry, Vegeta fucking dancing, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, i know. I was desperate.</br>  <br> Not remembering how many times Goku said he was hungry in DB. </br>  <br><br>That was, as previously said, tolerable.<br><br>The joke worked overall because it built character. In case of Beerus, it's a fucking gimmicky japshit joke.<br><br>In case of Buu, it's too forced.<br>Goku had a reason to be hungry all the time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are there any studios left that don't make shows look like digital shit? Where is all the hand drawn stuff from the 90s?  FUCK JUST SHUT UP.. Did anyone of you finish the inert torrent yet?  <br>47 minutes left on mine.</br>  <br>Too costly to make, along with CGI being the cheaper alternative.<br><br>Welcome to 2010+.<br><br><br>Just wait you fucking faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Upload to mega please when done.. 1 hour left on mine, torrent is hella slow..<br><br><br>Go watch your Naruto and wait for canon you non lab member.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In short, toriyama... wanted to quit after the freezer arc <br><br>I know everybody loves to throw around this line that Toriyama wanted to quit after Freeza, but there's no reliable source that has ever had him say that<br><br>See <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/intended-<wbr>end/freeza/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fusion reborn all over again.</br>  fuck inert torrent.. 500kbps uploading, 10kbps downloading  <br>I like it, but I also think Dragon Ball is a much better series than Z.</br>  <br><br>is that the only torrent with english subs out there?</br></br>  <br>Why the fuck does Whis have the thick black lines, but Bills doesn't?<br><br>If they're going for a certain style, they could at least try and make it fucking consistent</br></br></br>  <br> I have never experienced any non-serious part of dragon ball or any of AT's other works, and have this misplaced notion that it's a serious series. </br>  <br> I am completely oblivious to the fact that fun can be had while being sensible, not serious. <br> I am also greentexting someone's thinking, or rather my misconceptions of what that person must be like <br><br>Nigga, i love Dr. Slump. As i said before, it can be fun.<br><br>DB Super isn't fun, it's forced.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You expect anything else from the common American?<br>Be kind Anon, they got an awful dub and only watched DBZ.</br></br>  <br>It's no different than anything else in any other part of the series. Just accept that your tastes have changed.</br>  <br>yes.. theres one more subbed torrent but spanish.</br>  <br> The less impressive you seem the more impressive you actually are. <br>That's not how it went with Cell.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't that a cut scene in some tie-in video game?</br>  <br><br>looks like animerg has uploaded a torrent<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>13717</wbr></br></br></br></br>  The inert subs seems to work.  inert subs works.. confirmed.  <br> Which subs do I choose? </br>  <br>It's more of an impresiveness zigzag. The villains become more and less impressive than the other randomly.</br>  <br>Because they have a distorted vision of Dragonball. I've watched the show since I was 12 (starting with Dragonball and then Z), and Super looks like it naturally belongs to what I watched back in the days.</br>  Wat  <br>Forgot subs</br>  <br>Coming from someone who only really watched a big chunk of DBZ and not DB, I still don't have that distorted vision of DBZ being a serious fightin' anime. It had serious moments, but a lot of in between was goofy shit. I guess it's an american thing with the change in the music and the op.</br>  <br> Does anyone want to talk about death battle <br> taking something where spider-man lost to a fucking pony and vegeta almost losing to a hedgehog seriously </br></br>  <br> Memes  <br>inert is a shit group. Watch Dragon Team.</br></br>  <br>I woudn't even call those non-fighting segments "slice of life", if anything it's still comedy/adventure. And holy shit I do not miss the episodes-long power ups, pisspoor fighting "choreography" and general sense of "plot" not miving forward after suffering through long weeks of nothing happening. People say Kai is the go-to anime because it cuts the filler, but I never minded the filler to be honest, I always thought the manga lacked scenes where characters could interact, develop and just explore the universe a bit more. If some new version of kai would've been made which only made the fights more consice but left the filler, that would be my perfect version of the DB anime.</br>  <br>You should have waited for Moonlighters.</br>  <br>Fellow american, I think it's because DBZ hit it's peak in the US during Cell saga.</br>  <br>You're American? Why is it so hard for you to distinguish between it's and its?</br>  <br>I can tell you're not an American because you wrote you're correctly.</br>  I always considered Dragonball Z silly, mostly because of the opening we got.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dZ1<wbr>NcxAZUYk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This sounds like something for very little kids. I found it hilarious when I found out that burgers had stuff like Rock the Dragon that turned the show into some manly macho man extravaganza. Dragonball as far as I know, has always been considered to be a little boy's anime along with stuff like Super Sentai / Power Rangers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but everything french is queer, you should expect that by now</br>  <br>woah what the fuck<br>I remember DBZ having an opening like that at some point in my country and it's not even a french-speaking one</br></br>  <br>Bills is in the background<br>whis is in the foreground</br></br>  <br> do a version of the original opening <br> skip best part <br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Downloaded AnimeRG and its the same there</br></br>  <br> Thanx to INERT FOR GIVING ME THE SUB FILE!!! THANX A TON GUYS!!!! <br>What did you expect?</br></br>   Beerus killed the Dinosaurs, sealed Old Kai into the Z-Sword and watches chinese girl cartoons <br><br>What a tweest!</br></br>  <br> using Club Dorothée as a landmark for anything <br><br>Pretty sure at some point we left that shit behind us to keep the japanese openings, who don't really strike me as entirely meant for kids.</br></br></br>  Too much healing, I demand someone to die right fucking now.  Fuck off, Whis, you're no Burter.  <br>Man, that shit is just bizarre.</br>  <br> Beerus turning into a dog </br>  <br>People remember the highlights. How is this surprising?</br>  <br>FORGOT SUBS</br>  <br> Getting white frames just for your wedding outfit <br> Doesn't even need glasses <br><br>And Gohanfags will still go on about muh strongest in the universe</br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit stop<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BT1<wbr>Dp69D7q0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Wh8<wbr>ii9AFdSQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Just look at this picture. Literally perfect. Gohan and Videl as happy newlyweds, ready to start their life together. Piccolo reluctantly present because of how much he loves his boy. And look at Goku! Actually showing up to be apart of his son's life! Even if his main motivation was probably the food after the service, he still looks happy for Gohan. This shit right here really makes me want a whole wedding episode. Oh well, at least we got what we got.<br><br>SOL DB had been amazing, and I hope we get more. Seeing these characters acting more like real people, doing normal every day things, make them so much more relatable. When shit gets real, I'm going to be more invested in the fights because I'm more invested in these characters. Now bring in the Pilaf gang!</br></br>  <br>Why can't they just teleport?</br>  <br><br>They technically are the Beerus Squad now.<br>Whis, Beerus, the fish oracle, Goku, Vegeta.<br><br>Vegeta can be guldo.<br><br><br>Brought to you by Toei.

Toriyama forgot it.<br><br>Go with whichever.<br><br><br>Is it inherent to the plot? If yes, sure why not.<br> No Chi-chi in sight <br>Well, i guess that makes Piccolo the hard-working woma--- green space lizard slug in the Piccolo Goku Gohan love triangle.<br><br>Episode 4 is going to be filler in fucking filler.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's something I really love about Goku here. The way he's just hanging off Gohan, with that big goofy grin. It just fits his character so well. Like he is the "cool" dad (which make Piccolo the strict and serous parental unit). And it helps that he seems genuinely happy for Gohan and Videl! It feels like they're trying to depict Goku as a much better Father in super.</br></br>  <br>What if the entirety of the universe is placed inside the orb on top of Whis' staff?</br>  <br>Yeah, I don't care for it much either. Guy literally can't seem to shout any more.</br>  <br>Seen some people suggest that Chi-chi is the other person Goku is hanging off of, she just got cut out of the picture. Better question is where is Mr.Satan? Is the only thing that could make this better.</br>  <br>What a tweeest.<br>Please no, though.<br><br>Also, where the fuck is Fatrus and Femhis.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whis is God, Whis is the Universe, everything that happens is just a dream which Whis is dreaming.</br>  Holy shit these japanese voice actors all sound like they're about to die.  Why must subbers insert memes where memes are clearly not the proper translation?  Wait if King Kai died and come back to life, why didn't those other Kai's who were killed by Buu when he was under Bibidi's control come back with halos?<br><br>There's so much fucking inconsistency with all this shit.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry this is good DB and not endless beam spam and screaming you Americunt.</br>  <br>Funny as I was about to post same complaint with same screencap.<br><br>It seems memes are integral parts of fansubs now.</br></br></br>  <br>Gomu gomu plot-kai-no-jutsu-hameha</br>  So not only became a jobber but also a jew.<br><br>Fuck Toriyama.</br></br>  <br>That's clearly the beginning of a FKMT nose. Expect an arc where Gohan and Videl play against Beerus and Whis at Mahjong.</br>    <br><br><br> for free.jpg </br></br></br>  <br>Didn't he absorb them all, or am I remembering incorrectly? I know he absorbed the beefy kai and Daikaioh at any rate.<br><br>Though even if that was the case, what the fuck happened to them? Shouldn't they have still been inside Buu in those pod things?</br></br></br>  <br>Filler had a meaning before anime, you know. 90 procent of these episodes can be cut without affecting the overall story.</br>  in the inert subs i saw where it said something like<br><br>"chinese cartoons" .. was the subber trolling or did beerus actually say anime?</br></br>   No Pilaf flashback episode <br>It's cool that it looks like we're getting a Pilaf episode next week, but it'll just be an expanded version of BoG. So far this show has been some of Toei's laziest work.<br><br><br>DB is known for Goku and friends' light hearted adventures as they travel the world collecting the Dragon Balls.<br><br><br>Yeah. Kaiou is really hard to listen to, and Nozawa is starting to lose it. I wish they'd replace some VAs. Especially Gohan. Gohan needs a new voice. I'd think Furuya would make a good grown Gohan, but he's already Yamcha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't know that they won't do a flashback next episode to Pilaf and co. getting turned into kids.</br>   watching subs <br>Japanese isn't a hard language to learn guys. And this show is for children. The language is easy as fuck to understand.</br>  so BoG retelling? fine by me, but Bingo scene needs to happen.<br><br>I blame Brolyfags</br></br>  <br>We'll see, but based on the preview and the level of effort Toei has been putting in to the show so far it doesn't seem like it.</br>  <br> make a good Gohan when already a Yamcha <br>I think that could work in favor of the case.</br></br>  <br> Toei <br> putting any effort into anything that isn't Precure <br> ever </br></br></br>  <br>Beerus said anime.<br><br>But ebin memesters translated it as chinese cartoons.</br></br></br>  hurrrr muh fillers<br><br>dont you retards realize youre watching dragon ball?<br><br>you idiots would have been saying the same thing 20 years ago when dbz was airing</br></br></br></br>  <br>If couldn't go SSj i would agree.</br>  <br>It's more that Toriyama only has like 5 stock characters he can draw.</br>  <br>Seriously. Maybe it's because I'm more familiar with the manga, but this is a lot easier for me to watch than DBZ. DBZ's pacing is unbearable.</br>  <br>Alternative timeline confirmed.</br>  <br><br>Not to mention God Goku is fucking Crono from Chrono Trigger.</br></br>  <br> you idiots would have been saying the same thing 20 years ago when dbz was airing <br>most kids didnt knew what fillers were at the time because not everyone was reading the manga<br> defending moeshit in dbz <br>it would okay if the fillers were in toriyama tone</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone else finds ridiculous that a fucking SAIYAN needs glasses?<br><br>I find it really hard to believe that something as eye sight problems develops alongside the strongest genes in universe.</br></br></br>  <br>it's just brolytards and niggers, DBS it's a great series and has a lot of potential.<br><br>I just hope Pilaf doesn't show up THAT much though</br></br></br>  <br>That's his human genes showing.</br>  <br> I just hope Pilaf doesn't show up THAT much though <br>Fuck you Pilaf is the best.<br><br>Also the problem is really secondaries in general, I think. Z-fags, or whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why hasn't anyone started fighting yet? <br><br>I want underage kids who only watched DBZ to fucking leave</br></br></br>    <br>Problem lies in people who started DB with DBZ and I guess that is mostly true for Americans.<br><br>I was watching DB from first episode while growing up and for me the screaming retards in DBZ were something different.</br></br></br>  <br> I just hope Pilaf doesn't show up THAT much though <br>He's going to help save the universe(s) in the finale, I guarantee.</br></br>  I love Super so far. Feels a lot closer do DB than DBZ ever did. Don't worry spics, your "epic fighting lmao" starts on episode 5.  <br> Episode 2 <br> Whis said Beerus was waiting for an idol <br> Subbed as pop star <br>It's like you don't foresee shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan is a turbonerd, it's basically the law for him to wear glasses.</br>  <br>The underage card doesn't go for DBZ.<br>It's actually 20 somethings.<br>Which makes it even worse.</br></br></br>  <br>inert is jokesubs. Don't bother with them.</br>   tfw we get this SoL piece of shit instead of AF     DB test is simple.<br><br>You ask "Do you think Broly is a good character?"<br><br>If yes, just walk away.<br>If no, continue conversation,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How was this episode even SoL? It was all set up for the Beers fight. We had Beers finding out about Goku and everyone gathering for the party.</br>  <br> Official. <br>Stop.</br></br>  <br> spics <br>A-ha! The main spic has shown himself.<br>Fuck off with your moe forced japshit SoL non-toriyama paced shit.<br><br>Toriyama + DB was OK. This isn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lunch and Mai not god tier <br>I want Z-fags to leave.<br><br><br>You guys are trying to force this shit so hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it annoy you that I'm a normie who literally only comes to this board once a week for a few hours after DBS? I've never even watched Dragonball either, just the funimation DBZ.</br>  <br>Launch is the best. Now fuck off.</br>  Is North Kai's VA dying? He sounds like shit. He's 80something, right?  <br>Unless you've been studying the language for years it's not easy to understand. Stop with this nonsense.</br>  <br>and that's your average DBZ fan<br><br>what a shame</br></br></br>  <br>Make your own waifu chart then you autismo.</br>  <br> a female sayan with a screentime of 5 seconds <br> high tier <br> mai and lunch <br> low tier <br>Get a load of this pleb</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2011+4 <br> not wanting to see SSJ5 Vegeta </br></br>  <br> moe <br>I don't think you understand what that word means.</br></br>  <br>He has to sense someone's energy or ki or whatever you wanna call it in order to do it.<br><br>It's not a warp to blank space, it's locate someone's energy and then warp to them. It's why he had to warp to King Kai's planet first to find New Namek and get Dende to be the new Kami/Guardian of Earth. Because he didn't know where it was because it was so damn far away from earth.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Goku say in the Funimation dub that he moves at the speed of light? Was that line never in the original?</br>  <br>Piccolo blinking just as he's being photo'd is the best thing about that episode for me haha</br>  <br> he hasn't been studying the language for years <br>Wow. Why have you been wasting your time shit-posting on /a/ instead of learning a new language?</br></br>  <br>It goes further than that<br><br> did you like GT? <br>"I hate it blaghblaghblagh"<br> walk away <br>"I didn't like it, it doesn't matter because it isn't canon"<br><br>continue, then...<br><br> is your favorite character Vegeta? <br>yes<br> walk away <br>no...<br><br>then<br><br> did you like BoG? <br>"no because muh fights and bingo"<br> walk away <br>"not my cup of tea but it was fine/yeah sure<br> start having the conversation. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not King Kai chasing Goku around  <br><br>I don't like your opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is broly such a big deal? I have seen his movie maybe once, as with most of them.<br>I appreciate them having had a good idea about Broly being the legendary SSJ and all but in the end I don't give a fuck about him. <br>He isn't canon and the movie sucks,like all shounen movies suck, because there is no development or anything at stakes.</br></br></br>  Either they need to get a replacement VA for King Kai, or they need to stop giving him lines. It's just painful how little he's able to act now, especially when the animation still tries to make him look energetic despite his voice.  <br> Funimation dub <br>Oh boy.</br></br>  <br>1 year to understand audible if you aren't a mentally handicapped person</br>  <br>I have been and don't need subs either, but let's not pretend it's easy to get to that point.</br>    <br>You don't know Japanese. Please stop pretending you do.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> Americucks getting BTFO <br>Go watch DB Absalon, it's more up your alley.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Broly is literally this picture.<br><br>Nothing more or less it's the worst of Dragon Ball in one character.</br></br></br>  <br>But i'm at 40% of my learning at most, also <br><br> lying on 4chan  <br><br>stop being underage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was more iintrigued by Whis reacting to Beerus dick.</br>  So just some clarification: are Battle of the Gods and Fukkatsu no F canon or not? They were declared canon, but Super contradicts them.<br><br><br> It's just painful how little he's able to act now <br> now <br><br>So you're telling me that it's the same actor from Z Kai? And that that Kai was better? I thought Super Kai was shit, but I've never seen Z in Japanese.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is going to be a retelling<br><br>Super has manga and TV, so I gues is the canon route<br><br>those movies were a marketing test anyway</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure they're canon but DBS is the more accurate version of events.</br></br>  <br>Even /djt/ isn't stupid enough to lie about not needing subs after only a year.</br>  <br>Super is retelling them, so they're not canon anymore.</br>  <br>Toriyama only gave the BASIC outline for Super and the designs. Despite Super being "canon",there could be things that contradict the movies,since Tory wrote very little of it.</br>   king kai's animation says he's losing his shit  <br> king kai's voice says he's half-asleep and doesn't give a fuck about anything <br>What the fuck is this, man<br>I don't remember him being this fucking detached in Z, or even BoG<br>Did someone kill the guy's dog between BoG and now?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then /djt/ is retarded, because this is fucking DBZ</br>  Am I the only one that likes King Kai's Japanese voice? Funimation King Kai has always been fucking terrible.  <br>Dude is very ill.</br>  <br>Maybe if you're an useless NEET who has no job and doesn't attend college.<br><br>Japanese is an useless skill and won't get you anywhere in life unless you actually have a degree on it.</br></br></br>  <br>If he couldn't go SSJ and it turned out Gohan was Yamcha's cuckson, I'd laugh.<br><br>Maybe Yamcha lost the first round that his sperm automatically evolved into Saiya-jizz to cut all ties.</br></br></br>  Am i the only that likes King Kai's voice ?<br><br>It sound so...<br><br>Original.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, just a functional brain and a couple of hours a day<br><br>Also, learning kanguages itself is a skill, don't be mad if you are a retarded person anon.</br></br></br>  <br> I found it hilarious when I found out that burgers had stuff like Rock the Dragon that turned the show into some manly macho man extravaganza <br><br>Because that's what it is.<br>Half of DBZ consists of shirtless roided up martial artists screaming/powering up and beating the shit out of eachother.<br><br>The original "Dragon Ball" anime, is the one that's more lighthearted and whimsical.<br><br> inb4 the manga is all just called "Dragon Ball" <br><br>Yes, I know. But, it gradually became more action orientated. By the time the Saiyan Saga happens, it's practically just WWE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Markus probably posts on /a/ now </br>  <br> couple of hours a day <br> not needing subs after a year <br><br>Your story is falling apart. Just fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They were, but are no longer as Super is retelling them and basically stretching everything out in classic Dragon Ball filler fashion.<br><br><br>He's like 84 and probably dying.</br></br></br></br>  The pacing in this show is shit. For a comparison, go re-watch the beginning of DBZ.<br><br>By the first episode, we already met all the characters, the first main villain displayed his powers and confronted the good guys, and the entire first arc was set up and ready to go.<br><br>3 eps in, and Super did almost jack shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger what the fuck was that?</br>  <br> a couple of hours a day <br>I invest the couple of hours I have into gym workout in the morning so I can live a healthier life instead of being a pathetic NEET. The rest is taken by college and work.</br></br>    <br> Also, learning kanguages itself is a skill <br>Learning a language for watching cartoons is fucking useless no matter how you put it.</br></br>  <br>I'm fine with his voice in general, it's just that he seems like he's too tired to emote.</br>  <br> going to the gym everyday <br> a couple of hours at the gym <br><br>You're either retarded or not natty.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the art looks fucked, The style kinda needed that washed out look, the high contrast color makes it look strange.</br></br>  <br>After watching Kai, all the Jap voices have grown on me<br>Even Goku's</br></br>  <br>You are on /a/ faggot, you are nowhere where you think you are in life.</br>  <br>I thin he was a bit better this episode then he was last at least. It is pretty sad to hear though. He's 84 this year I think.</br>    Who does the best speedsubs of DBS?  <br>Holy shit put away your N-goggles.<br><br>Would shows from the years 1980-2000 would have been produced now they wouldn't have ever looked washed out you retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Poland?</br>  <br>Just wait until Dragon Team's subs on Monday. The only subs up now are full of memes.</br>  <br> Vegeta can be Guldo <br>Shouldn't that be the fish, really?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It's a product of its time. <br><br>Burgers got Dragonball Z much later (1996), but frogs got it as early as 1988.<br><br>I'm sure it would turn out similarly weird if Dragonball Z aired that early in the USA.<br><br>The 80s manifested itself differently in every country. <br><br>We also got "gems" like this:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rbg<wbr>-InH7EGo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is DBS not on CrunchyRoll? I would have expected HorribleSubs to pick it up.</br>  <br>Yeah at this point I don't know why I'm watching it week by week - I should just wait a year and maybe something will finally be happening.</br>  I know Toriyama admitted he just forgot about her, but is there an actual in-universe reason why Launch just disappeared?  <br>What a terrible fucking decade.</br>  <br> slice of life <br>Pretty sure people here just call the non-fighting segments slice of life just to piss off the retards getting mad at Dragon Ball Super's early episodes.<br><br>You know, since slice of life tends to be associated with "moeshit"</br></br></br></br>  <br>trips confirm it</br>  <br>"moeshit" = "anything that isn't 100% serious that I don't like" on /a/  de geso </br>  <br>They're not memes just 'cause they used localized names, dude. Wtf's wrong with you? Don't be a weeb.</br>  <br>I haven't really studied it outside of High School but after watching it for so long I am pretty confident I can understand kids stuff by ear fairly well at least. At least well enough to have been watching it without subs for the last few years now.</br>  <br>actually, Toriyama can screw them up just by saying that as SSJG, he emits the spectrum of a Red sun. That's the best thing that Toriyama can do for Goku to end this senseless debate.</br>  <br>By the first episode of Dragon Ball Super, we caught up with Goku's side of the cast (there's more characters now, you know), the main villain displayed his powers and the first arc was already set up (Bills is destroying planets on a whim, someone must stop him)<br><br>I think you really need to take off the nostalgia goggles.</br></br></br>  Only good anime this season  <br>fucking this, sadly</br>  As someone who's formally studied Japanese, I'd say it takes around 2 years of study, at maybe 10-20 hours a week, to be able understand something like DBS.  <br>  I am pretty confident I can understand kids stuff by ear fairly well at least <br><br>What does this even mean? You either understand it or you don't. You don't just magically absorb tens of thousands of words. <br><br> I haven't really studied it outside of High School <br><br>lol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to add that the anon you're talking to is likely confusing the first episode of Kai with Z<br><br>I remember Z's first episode ending with Raditz looking for Goku. He wasn't even at Kame House by the end of the first episode, and most of said episode was spent pissing around with Goku looking for Gohan. In fact, Raditz didn't confront "good guys" in the first episode - Piccolo was still a villain.<br><br>tl;dr - Yeah, he really needs to take off the nostalgia goggles, the pacing was already clunk in Z by the first episode.</br></br></br></br></br>  I don't get the whole "lel kiddies who started with DBZshit" stuff. That was me, but as I got older I realized there's a lot more to the franchise. I don't think I could go back to the dub and prefer and much prefer DB to DBZ these days. <br><br>Starting with DBZ and being a nostalgiafag is no excuse for being retarded.</br></br>  <br>*clunky</br>  <br>see </br>  <br> Piccolo was still a villain <br>I'm sorry, but Piccolo became a hero the second he fought Raditz the first time. He was in denial about it for a while, but c'mon.<br><br>It's kinda like how Vegeta became a hero the second they started battling the Ginyu force, even though he tried to pretend he was still a villain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  his day has 18 hours <br>Normalfags, everyone. I spend that on Chinese cartoons alone.</br></br>  <br>It's okay if you don't believe me, I don't expect you too. But as far as kids shows go I can understand enough to have a general idea of what's going on as well as pick up enough to understand the dialogue. Not properly, no coherently, but enough to be able to enjoy it and still discuss it with others. <br><br> Lol you can't understand something unless you spend a jillion years learning studying for it and have a piece of paper to prove it! <br><br>I never claimed to be a master, just that in all my years being involved with the culture and after having been to Japan once or twice, I've picked up enough basic knowledge to have a general idea of things. Things aren't black and white you fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>beerus is a shitty character</br>  <br>For me. He is the best villain this series( i mean DB,Z and GT)every had. I fucking love this guy...cat.</br>  <br><br>I take around 16 credits per term and work. I still have time to study Japanese and Spanish.<br><br> Mostly because I'm a sophmore linguistics major and 8 of those credits are actually Japanese/Spanish classes. </br></br></br></br>  <br>And for the record, it's okay if you want to continue living in your world of "Things have to be one way or another, it's physically impossible for you to learn something or pick something up naturally", that's fine. It's how you think about things. It's sad, but it's the way it is anon.</br>  <br> How are you going to get a job after you graduate? </br>  <br>Yea that's exactly what I meant, faggot.</br>  <br><br>Jesus Christ you're delusional.<br><br>You probably tell people you know Japanese too, don't you?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Probably gonna go into the JET program for a few years, then go back and get my master's and eventually PhD. After that, probably gonna end up spending the rest of my life working at a research uni. </br>  <br> not knowing that JET is extremely competitive  <br><br>good luck, though</br></br></br>  <br>With linguistics you can teach and translate<br>Pretty easy to find jobs for it in my country</br></br>  Why did this thread turn into a blogshit?  <br> Not knowing that JET's extremely competitive because so many people apply who have limited knowledge of Jap. <br><br>You look way nicer if you're actually proficient in Japanese, 'cause it means they can shove off more desk work onto you.</br></br></br>  <br>Underage please leave</br>  Alright fags, I'm out, see you all in the thread next week.

What do you want them to do?</br>  Requesting Sakurako and Himawari from Yuru Yuri in another of their little fights, with both in swimsuits (artists choice from ref sheet), with Sakurako leaning forward a bit and wearing a smug-ass grin, having just shoved Himawari down front-first into an oversized wet dessert cream pie, with Himawari looking surprised/humiliated/shocked and soaked swimsuit and all in the pie cream.  Requesting a color of this. Here's a reference: http://i.imgur.com/BJgeLG8.jpg  Requesting a combination of Silver Crow and Silver Karasu's outfits  Coming upon a clearing in the woods  while wearing a hooded cloak  <br> In the clearing is one is one of these gods: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cernu<wbr>nnos https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mieli<wbr>kki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudra<wbr> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapio<wbr>_%28spirit%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekke<wbr>itsertok or cute Artemis and/or Diana </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>Does she ever come across any sort of danger or in contact with another person? I'm actually curious</br>  The general seems so much more peaceful right now.  <br>Probably because everyone moved to the WWD.</br>  <br>Pretty much.<br>Could you draw some more cute/lewd lolis in the meantime, Heikatsu?</br></br>  <br>Honestly I kind of wish I could move my requests from the WWD to the general, even if I could I don't want double dipping shitposting because all the meta shit from that thread drags into the general during the week.</br>  This poster from Hostel 1 but with Shion from Higurashi holding the chainsaw and wearing that mask. Make sure she is wearing the attached maid outfit. <br><br>It says:<br>“Ni-Pah!” <br>-Rika <br><br>Ryukishi7 presents:<br>"Higurashi"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The general is the best during the weekends.</br>  <br> Could you draw some more cute/lewd lolis in the meantime, Heikatsu? <br>Sure thing! I can try to draw some stuff later today when I'm less busy.<br><br> the meta shit from that thread drags into the general during the week. <br>The WWD is kind of awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was one of the people who told you you'd be better off doing deliveries in the general where you'll probably be appreciated more for what you were delivering there. <br><br>How's it been working out for you anyway?</br></br></br>  <br> So close. </br>  <br>awesome, man. I'll look forward to it.</br>  Requesting Louise walking funny after spending the night with Thickus Dickus and Biggus Dickus  Requesting moe maids! Tripping over, spilling water, soda, etc while screaming KYAAAA GOMEN NASAI  Now that I think about it, a maid cafe with different anime gals would be nice...  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128225109 <br>Get my tabs mixed up, every time.</br>  <br>Well  yeah .  From this point on I want her to run into more people, interact with various deities and mythical creatures.  I've got an end in mind.  </br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu in cute swimsuits kissing underwater like in Sakura Trick  <br>Cool, I wonder if you ever thought of her running into other yurus</br>  <br>Yeah that will definitely happen  as long as artist stay interested heheh </br>  <br>Well I have to say that I've been enjoying the work people put into your requests. Hope enough drawdudes are still interested in finish it!</br>  <br>I've been lucky that some really talented people have been picking them up. And thanks so do I</br>  Hey OR, just wanted to let you know that I'm working on this, is taking longer than I expected but I'm quite busy and I'm trying not to rush, otherwise it wouldn't be as good  Requesting Yamcha and Maron cuddling together.  <br>Holy shit, those details.<br>Not OR, but good going.</br></br>  <br> going nuts on the goggles <br><br>I understand, metal stuff is fun to paint.</br></br></br>   tfw when the best request you got from this drawthread was of a character you eventually despised   <br> While bulma isn't looking. </br>  <br>With gape and cum drip still in effect.</br>  <br>Sweet mother of god! Take as much time as you need, that looks absolutely perfect!</br>  Requesting Snail and Bat in extremely skimpy bikinis like the girls on the left have.<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/7NGI7jF.jpg</br></br>  <br>I get the superslut part, but the milf?</br>  <br><br>Okay finally back, heres one I did while testing some new brush settings. <br><br><br>Posting more in the general? Worked out fine I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lines look really clean. If you're still in a drawing mood, have you ever done Hachikuji? Lewds of her are surprisingly scarce.</br>  <br>nice.<br>all I can note is that her butt seems to look kinda tiny perspective wise compared to her head.</br></br>  <br> Dat loli-vagina <br>Holy shit muh dick. You must be some sort of Semen-Sorcerer to make my cum shoot out so fast at such force like that. Not OR but you are my nigga, younger looking lolis never get drawn.</br></br>  <br>Fantastic loli as usual. Looking forward to whatever you do next. <br><br>Something with some bulges hopefully.</br></br></br>  Requesting Aisha hugging Jim from behind while wearing nothing but an oversized shirt and underwear, and Jim is noticeably embarrassed by it.<br><br>This isn't a good request for the waifu thread is it?</br></br>  <br>I agree. Its all teens people try to pass off as loli. Could use some more younger lolis from time to time.</br>  Requesting a redrawn version of this, this time, colored, it doesn't have to be too fancy, just good enough so i can post it on other threads.  <br>Thanks. <br>I'm surprised there are so few lewds of her, since shes so popular. I'm not terribly fond of her so the chance i'll draw her is very slim, sorry. <br><br><br>Thanks, Noted. I completely agree, there are a lot of small issues I have with it. I will work on making the butt a little larger but other problems I probably will not change since its just a quick drawing and not something I terribly care about. "Fixed" version will be posted to my pixiv. <br><br><br><br>No prob. Glad you enjoyed it.<br> younger looking lolis never get drawn. <br>It's a real shame, honestly. Rest assured though I'm not afraid to take drawing requests of younger characters.<br><br><br> Something with some bulges hopefully. <br>Same here stomach bulges are great, I'm staying up late tonight, I'll do some more drawings definitely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You ever looking for requests feel to say so. I don't typically request lewd stuff in these threads unless people offer. Looking forward to tonight with the more good stuff.</br>  <br>I wish I could request you, but publicly requesting lewd of my waifu is like impossible for me.</br>  <br> Looking forward to tonight with the more good stuff. <br>Go ahead and request if you feel like it. Whether I choose to take on the request or not is uncertain. Depends on the request and if I feel like doing it or not. If you have a request, post it, if i dont accept it im sure somebody else will. <br><br><br> publicly requesting lewd of my waifu is like impossible for me. <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Illya getting  DP? </br>  <br><br>how about something cute for an aside?</br></br>  <br> Why? <br>I get extremely uncomfortable up to the point of anxiety when I attempt to.<br> Guess I must be a literal faggot. </br></br></br>  <br> Go ahead and request if you feel like it. Whether I choose to take on the request or not is uncertain. <br>Well yeah. Its just a preference of mine not to request that sort of thing blind. Plus I'm not really sure what kind of stuff you are okay with. How obscene you are okay with being and that sort of thing. <br><br>Of course you can always just pass on it, thats a given. <br><br>I guess as a request<br><br><br>These Monogatari girls sharing a large dildo, with bulge.<br><br>You can age them down a bit if you want. Actually might be kind of interesting.<br><br><br>But as I said, not knowing how obscene you are okay with or how young or old you like to go its hard to choose one request and I would hate to post a whole bunch like a greedy asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Double points? On her capital cash back card?</br>  <br>I'm not sure if its the same thing as you, but I am honestly a little emotionally invested in most /a/ lolis I can think of to be okay with porn of them. And hell, even girls that aren't lolis but have loli body types, like Taiga, who is just made for sex, are a little hard to ask for porn of just because I have grown attached to them.<br><br>I don't know why, but /a/ related lolis I just get attached to.</br></br></br>  <br>A lolified Nadia getting spitroasted by two large cocks. I really don't like her so that would be an incredibly pleasant thing to see.</br>  <br>Oh, I don't actually have any problem with lewds of my waifu. I just can't publicly request lewds of her.</br>  <br><br> Please forgive me for this redirect, I don't usually do this sort of thing I swear.  No worries if you don't pick it up</br></br>  <br>Not the same thing then. Like I try and fap to porn of some girls like Taiga, or the Monogatari girls, and I can't do it unless its really sweet and happy porn. Anything else and I just get upset and have to stop. As pathetic as that is.</br>  <br>Why are Japanese animals so incredibly sexual?</br>  <br>fucking kekd</br>  <br>It's the nature of all Japanese things, it can't be helped.</br>  Requesting Noriko and Jung doing topless symetrical docking.

How obscene you are okay with being and that sort of thing. <br>There isn't really a limit on obscenity. I don't draw guro though.<br>I'm no expert at drawing (obviously) so complex requests or requests with multiple characters or detailed backgrounds and objects are less likely to be picked. <br><br><br> I am honestly a little emotionally invested in most /a/ lolis I can think of to be okay with porn of them <br>I've done deliveries of H-manga lolis in the past. Are you emotionally attached to those as well?<br><br><br>I hate her too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  May I have something sexy-lewd (such as posing nude, except keep her shoulder/head armor on) with Martei from the Mega Man X2 manga, please?  Louise, in this dress having a run in with cunt destroyer.  <br><br><br><br>Didn't feel like drawing all that extra stuff, so I just drew her lewdly masturbating.

It's a shame his latest comic in LO still hasnt been translated. <br><br><br> Not a fan of guro either, but sometimes you just don't know. Thats good to keep in mind. I'll try and think up some pretty obscene things then. <br>One of human kind's most precious gifts is the ability to express our imagination, even when it's lewd or offensive, you should have the right to do so. So personally I have no issues with drawing obscene lewdities. I'm still learning, so theres some things too complex for me to draw though. <br><br><br> I'd shake your hand right now if they weren't both completely covered in cum. <br>Fantastic! I'm so glad you enjoyed it. <br> this delivery is so fappable and adorable <br>I know, right? I love her expression.<br> I'm really glad I bit the bullet and link-redirected you. <br>Huh? I don't understand. What do you mean?<br> Your lolis that are actually lolis instead of the usual "lolis" that are just teenagers <br>Ah, yes.

I haven't fucked with Digimon for like 16 years so I'm out of the loop but it could be a fun request, maybe.</br>  <br>Not really, doubt it'd be a character you'd want to draw since I'd only choose my waifu or daughteru.

Much appreciated.</br></br></br>  <br>I will finish it, just not right now.<br><br>Blame evo for that :V</br></br></br>  Here's my request. Msyu with butt raised ready for mating and a dog mounting her. Q (another character from C - Money of Soul) is stroking the dog's back and tightly holding the dog's swollen knot. The tip of the dog's penis is inside msyu. Msyu is looking back with a fearful expression (the dog's penis is huge for her small body). The dog is straining to get inside Msyu. Q has a sympathetic expression and is stroking the dog's back. The dog should be large but not ridiculous big, "realistically big". View from side, left. Q on right of Msyu (opposite side away from camera).<br><br>Big props to you if you pick it up, thank you</br></br>    <br>Might try this out. Complicated clothes are a pain though</br>  Requesting Rei, Warp from Kaiba and Lain in the bear suit sitting in fron of the bonfire from dark souls. The characters can be simplified or chibi versions.  <br>I mentioned the last part just so that the designs are consistent.</br>  <br>Neat</br>  Where do you guys get complete set of character design sheets of shows?  <br>I would assume it can be a little easier if you google the character's name along with "concept art" or something.<br><br>Also, going to the series's wikia helps too.</br></br></br>  <br>I checked zerochan and it has scans of character sheet.</br>  Requesting Sakaki as a Jinko, carrying Maya, her cat. Either in her mouth by the nape, or on her back.<br>Something more cool than lewd, really.<br>http://i.imgur.com/StI8m2u.png</br></br>  Requesting life.  <br>Don't request too much, since the general is gonna be full of WWD drama after the weekend if over, friend.</br>  <br>If they aren't complete, I watch the show, since they are often drawn in every angle.</br>  <br>not OR, she looks cute, thanks for the cute Futayo!</br>  Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  <br>depends on who is your waifu and what situation<br><br><br>heh, i remember this one<br><br><br>guess ill just use her black uniform, tho its kinda on hold till i get back in the mood in continuing, doodling something else for now<br><br><br>no one requested (pic related), just drawing it till i get tired for now<br><br><br><br>lel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>draw smut of misha!</br>  New chapter up soon.  I don't think there's any 'anticipation' for this shit anymore.<br> also be prepared to be flooded with /co/tards starting August. Thanks Toonami </br>  <br>GOOK SCANS WHEN</br>  <br>Niggastream &amp; the gooks are at fault for that.</br>  <br>Tashiro said on his twitter the new chapter will be exciting and interesting.</br>  <br>Who gives a shit anymore?<br><br>Sure. He wants to spark up some interest but this is already over. He'd better rush the thing and start something else.</br></br></br>  <br> implying we give a fuck about this. </br>    <br>I want to believe</br>  <br>Into the trash it goes.</br>  <br>You keep saying that but the manga killed itself.</br>    <br> AgK <br> Anticipation Thread </br></br>  nobody anticipates akg  <br> he wasn't around for the 3000 replies mega threads <br>I pity you anon</br></br>  <br> Tashiro said his manga is gonna be exciting and interesting <br>So is he trying to promote his turd because interest is utterly dead or because even him knows that previous chapters were boring shit?</br></br>  mine is kill soon I just can't wait anymore  <br>This is 2015 anon. Have you been living under a rock for the last 6 months?</br>  When will Toonami finally die? So tired of hearing how great AoT is. Just wait for the AgK love....  <br> youtube thumbnail <br> chibi reviews <br>holy shit kill yourself</br></br></br>  This series main plot was basically killing everything, funny enough it even killed itself...well, except mine because tatsumi needs a vegetable to fuck.   Toonami is airing the anime <br><br>Seriously? That was one of those "why did they even bother" adaptations. Animation? What's that?</br></br>  What happened to chapter 61? Did it have a month off, or was last month's chapter never scanned?  <br>There wasn't a chapter last month, you dickhead.</br>  <br>Gonna take more than a bit of teasing to make this hype again.</br>  <br>It was LITERALLY 2015 6 months ago you fucking retard</br>  <br>Looks like Akame IS Kill.</br>  <br><br>Literally BTFO</br></br>  <br>Don't worry anon, I still like it.<br><br>The pacing with half chapters, skipping months and nothing happens chapters, however, it's killing it.</br></br></br>  I want to be balls deep in Akame.  <br> Let's name the manga after her and then give her a bullshit move that forces us to never give her any screen time <br>Top Tashiro</br></br>  <br>This, it's a hassle to follow this shit because how wierdly the chapters are being released for an ongoing series</br>  <br>You mean Takahiro. Tashiro is the artist.</br>  <br> completely forgot AGK existed <br>Fuck it's been too long.</br></br>  <br> I watched the shitty "adaptation" that based was based on nothing but the same name as a popular manga <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>because the whole manga is being written from the viewpoint of Akame.</br>  <br>what?</br>  <br>English speak you do?</br>  <br>ようやく校了しました。今月号は面白カットいっぱい作ったから楽しみにして<wbr>て下さいね。単行本の特典関係も目一杯頑張ったので是非ともゲットして下さ<wbr>い。「夏！」って感じですよー<br>https://twitter.com/endergate01/sta<wbr>tus/620829286694436864</wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> that based was based on nothing but the same </br>  <br><br>I'm on my phone, remove the first "based" and you've got a sensible sentence you fucking turboautists</br></br>  <br>For fucks sake.<br>It was originally supposed to be "Night Raid" but that was already taken so it got changed to Akame ga Kill.<br>Fucking newfag, has been mentioned numerous times.</br></br></br>  <br>I got what you said, I just don't get what the fuck you're talking about. <br>I didn't watch the anime.</br></br>  <br> I'm on my phone <br> using a phone to post here <br>Destroy yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty based.</br>  <br>Like I give a fuck about reading some anime news network shill piece about this bullshit manga for babies.</br>  <br>looks like new vol cover</br>  <br><br> not using your phone to shitpost in bed in the morning when you're hungover <br><br>You're doing something wrong</br></br></br></br>  Hell, the last chapter was decent. Leone being awesome was something I've waited a while for  <br>At least it was better than the previous one which was easily the worst AgK chapter ever. Even meet dog was better.</br>  This months magazine cover.<br><br>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKLe2HG<wbr>UcAABRpF.jpg</wbr></br></br>  What was the point of Wild Hunt again?  <br> posting on phone <br> hungover </br></br>  Manga Version cumming Soon.  <br>I think anime version will look better.</br>  The anime was so bad it made me stop giving a shit. Whats happened since lubbock died and the gang went to go rescue tatsumi?  <br>To be ga Kill.</br>  <br>RIP Leone</br>  <br> being an autist </br>  <br>From whose twitter account did you get that image from?</br>  Dropped after worst girl became a vegetable.  <br>/r/akamegakill</br>  Did /a/ really collectively drop this?<br>Something cataclysmically bad must have happened for everyone to drop it.</br>  Akame a cute.  <br>Filler Rape got finally removed.</br>  <br>Pretty much  but adding unnecessarily characters deaths and Wild Hunt disappointment.</br>  <br>She became  a pumpkin </br>  <br> Wild Hunt disappointment <br>But they're gone. Forever.</br></br>  <br>its like she opens mouth for cock or food.</br>  &gt;Did /a/ really collectively drop this?<br> Mine shippers/waifufags stop caring when she turned into a vegetable <br> Esdeathfags don't care if she's not around <br> going full Naruto <br> focus on remaining WH members most don't care about and them going out like some random filler trash <br>Akames and leones can only do so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  Scans when  <br>300 seconds</br>  <br>Oh finally someone make a thread for this. Well I still interested since I wanted to know what will esdese fate be at the end of the manga.</br>  <br>5 mins</br>  <br><br><br><br>Doesn't help the anime ushered in a big crowd causing a lot of the threads to be unbearable for ages to go along with the shitflinging the manga already generates.<br><br>Now nothing remains, around the decay.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> akame ga shit anticipation <br>What th-<br> youtube manga review <br><br> redditors <br>Figures. Cancer fuck off with this garbage</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> maximum autism </br>  <br>Crawl back to your shithole site</br>  <br>you first faggot</br>  <br>This, next time post tumblr gifs too<br>I mean who gives a fuck about standards, right</br></br>  <br>Urami Koi koi is cute</br>  YES!!! I really cannot wait for some more akame ga greatness :)  <br> dem tits <br> dem delicious armpits <br><br>Glorious</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, threads have been pretty dead for a while. <br><br>Will probably remain that way until we get more Esdeath/Tatsumi interaction.</br></br></br>  HAIL THE GOOKS:<br><br>http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>471278</wbr></br></br>  <br>Don't forget spoiler anon is gone and niggerstream killed all the hype threads, which was one of the main points of reading. The manga is pretty bland apart from the shock value, which spoiler threads did best.<br>Waifufags, like you said, all grew tired and moved on.<br>The anime killed hype for the ending because the second half was so bad. <br>Now toonami I hear? The series is fucking dead. Never has there been a case this bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  AgK is dead already  <br>OMG he is turning into a biological dragon!</br>  IT'S HAPPENING<br><br>HAIL TYRANT<br>A<br>I<br>L<br><br>T<br>Y<br>R<br>A<br>N<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well , other than start of Akame vs Wale and  nothing really happened.</br>  <br><br>We Bleach now</br></br>  <br> Akame vs Wave <br> Tats goes full dragon <br>Skimmed through that crap and I'm 10 chapters behind.<br>Literally who cares, R.I.P. Wave.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's cool.</br>  so probably gonna follow like in the anime with akame vs kurome  <br>We got to see Esdeath with her new move.</br>  <br>Super speedread that shit, no Mine, fucking shit. Re-dropped.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br><br>Replace Kurome with Wave</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Wave kills that bitch</br>  So next month we drink Wavefag tears?  <br><br>doubit because wave is the 2 MC accodiring to takahiro</br></br>  <br>was that her new special move or just one that hadn't been previously showed in the manga?</br>  Does anyone eben remember them all?  <br>Bu but he is better than Tatsumi</br>  <br>lame pun incoming..<br><br>A WAVE of tears.</br></br></br>  Wave a shit and worst girl.  <br> draw perfect and qt grills <br> have them die <br>Why is this allowed?<br><br>Time for Wave to fly again.</br></br></br></br></br>  There are people still reading this?  <br>Spear, Coro, aniki, Sayo, Tatsumi, Mine, Cordelia, Tsukushi can't remember the last one.</br>   Akame vs. Wave <br><br>fuck this shit to be honest</br></br>  <br>Tyrantsumi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wave&gt;&gt;Tatsumi</br>  I think he has all the right pieces he needs to fix this manga.<br><br>He needs to establish some more allies and fanservice girls to Tatsumi's team. Along with that, have Tatsumi go down a dark ascent into madness.<br><br>Have him questioning his loyalties and going up to join esdeath because of all the pain he felt being apart of night raid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good hopefully Wave fucking dies so a good girl can win.</br>  I dropped it when Akame was revealed not only to be a super-swordsman, but also Bruce Lee in naked hand combat, which chapter was that?  <br>To think that I used to hype this so much.</br>  <br> they told me I could be anything so I became Tyrant </br>  <br>the last one</br>  <br>That's stupid.</br>  <br>I still don't understand if she is supposed to be big breasted or not.</br>  Guys come on, it's not that bad, let's try and do damage control on this manga. <br><br>/a/ does it for literally EVERYTHING posted here, let's not give up. We need to try and coat the shit with paint and make things seem better.</br></br>  Meh. Re-dropping this till Tyrant fully takes over the manga and shows everyone how shit gets done  <br>Breast size in the manga and the anime fluctuates a lot</br>  <br>And we wouldn't want that, would we now?</br>  <br> 2 covers for Mein <br> 2 covers for Leone <br> 2 covers for Esdese <br> 1 cover for Akame <br><br> Akame ga KILL <br> Akame </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it is shit. Ever since Takahiro decided that no one will die anymore.</br>  he should just make AKG VN  <br>Wave is way too nice. Where all the others just murder and kill, Wave goes and captures them. Like he doesn't even know what happens to prisoners.</br>  <br>That's why I said it.<br><br><br>More like Akame ga Shafted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, budo is given the most ambiguous death in the series, he might be still alive an making a return.<br><br>tyrantsumi might mean we won't need demon mode akame<br><br>mine might die</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The coat is in the way. She is pretty stacked.</br>  <br>In many scenes yes, but not all the time.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>So I guess that's it for Wave. I highly doubt that Akame is going anywhere.</br>  <br>So they will dance around with Esdeath and PM and just become friends?</br>  <br>Akame usually gets the alternative covers. And I'm sure she will be the cover for the last volume.<br><br><br>Mine won't die. If they wanted her dead, she would have died like in the anime instead of becoming a vegetable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that because she flat on the ground?</br>  Here lies Wave, he never won.  <br>No.</br>  <br>You can also grow up and leave threads you don't like.</br>  <br>Ending will be the same as the anime, but with Tats and Mein both alive and well.</br>   wave beat akame before because she couldn't cut his armor <br><br> it is canon that good enough swordsmen can cut through tyrants armor <br><br> yfw she kills wave because she has been practicing armor piercing moves in case tatsumi gets taken over by tyrant </br></br></br></br>    <br>The perfect job to end it all.</br>  <br> Katana <br> armor piercing <br>Wouldn't it just break?</br></br></br>  <br>Not if it's folded over a thousand times.</br>  <br>Akame ga beautiful</br>    <br>It looks the same bust size as this. </br>  <br>And then we get pictures like this where she's just small and her breasts look absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>So, you think that's the canon size? There are plently of pictures like this too.</br>  <br> Akame <br> Good <br><br>HAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br>  Akame would be better off dead then getting the same terrible fate as in the manga.  Is AgK popular again?  Mein is the cutest potato.  <br>while Lubbock pimps the girls in heaven. And this being AgK, there are many of them.</br>  I will fucking burn all of my AgK books if they just kill Wave without even hearing his ideals.  <br>Will probably get a popularity boost soon due to it being on Toonami  unfortunately </br>  <br>Pretty same that scene isn't as detailed as later volumes though.</br>  <br>So now Esdeath can also fly thanks to her teigu. That's not how Ice works.</br>  <br>No happy endings now.</br>  <br>There's not way Akame is going to cut through Grand Chariot, I guess either she uses her triumph card or they'll just stop fighting, or, the most probably one, she'll win with an asspull.</br>   sheere ded <br> aniki ded <br> introduces 2 new NR <br><br> chelsea ded <br> su ded <br> raba ded <br> mine ded <br> 0 new member <br><br>Here's the problem. Takahiro new to create more Main characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, Incursio will get 2 × Pratt &amp; Whitney F119-PW-100 pitch thrust vectoring turbofans to counter that.</br>  Soon.  <br> can't remember Zero's best girl <br>That's Poney.</br></br>  <br>*need</br>  <br> mine ded <br>No.</br></br>    <br>This is the last arc. Introducing new characters now is stupid.</br>   Fucking idiots still charging in on Esdeath <br><br>Why? If you see that bitch you just run for it. I will never understand these underlings that think they can just take on the strongest the enemy has to offer. Also literally who was that giant Black guy? Looked like Budo 2.0.</br></br>  <br>Time stop isn't how ice works either. Its demon blood she ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>I hope now that wild cunts are dead we can finally have a full on Rider fight.</br>  <br>They could just give some RA teigu users better design and characterization and have them interact with NR. Not just give them 2 panel each and then dropped dead.</br>  I don't think I've ever seen a series fall off the wagon quite as hard as AgK.<br><br>Fuck, 10 chapters ago the spoiler threads got to 1000s of replies. The anime really killed this series.<br><br>I realized what having an anime series finish the story off for you really does for a manga. It removes all interest in what happens next because, even if it IS different, the story is already concluded in people's mind. <br><br>Also Budo is the worst character in the story and Mine's "coma" is a complete copout after people bitching about her anime death though it was probably intended for her to die there in both anime and manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  One True Pairing thread.    How about rather just posting the pair you like you say what happens in the respective series that makes them so great together.    <br>She and Simon should have gotten together after they both lost their love. I mean its the only logical conclusion.<br><br>Anyway here is my mine.</br></br></br>  <br>lol acidentaly read ''painting'' thread,<br>lol sorry peeps, this my favourite pair i guess</br></br>  You are out driving and this little motherfucker is in your way.<br><br>wat do?</br></br>  <br>This too, the Japs are powerful enough fighting medieval civilizations with modern weaponry.
