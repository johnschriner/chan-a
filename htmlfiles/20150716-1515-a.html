[ http://marumaru.in/b/origin/94141<br><br>First part of 219 spoilers.<br><br>Full chapter is 65 pages.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the author died or something</br>  Can't even remember what happened last.  I have no idea if that is Nea or Allen buy I feel bad for the Earl.  I've lost all the plot point, only that the 13th or something will appear once in a while now.  <br>She have arthritis.</br>  <br>Definitely Neah at the moment.</br>  MOON   Art is still shit <br><br>Typical. Well at least she's working again.</br></br>  <br>This has got to be bait.</br>  <br>At that moment but at the hugscene it looked like Allen.</br>  <br>No? The art looks the same as last time.</br>  <br>Must be hard being blind</br>  BEST GIRL IS BACK   waiting two months for this shit <br><br>No thanks. At least Kekkai Sensen is back.</br></br>  <br>It's Nea<br>If that was Allen he would lose all his shit</br></br>  <br>I missed that because I quickly looked through it to see the Earl/Neah!Allen meeting.</br>  Road is best girl.  <br>Three months, anon.</br>  <br>Damn. I thought it was bi-monthly.</br>  <br>How many different designs has Hoshino given his innocence arm?</br>  Damn, Earl is cute.  <br>The first iteration looked carapace-y and the second iteration looks like the one on this page, except black. I don't THINK it changed, except for its color, but I can't say that I'm completely sure about that.</br>  <br>Just 2</br>  So what the fuck is happening here?  <br>Best girl returns<br>Nea attempts to kill the Earl, but couldn't</br></br>  can we confirm Lavi has become a wormslut yet?  Translation is in process, 7 pages so far  How can anyone call the art shit? It's amazing and better than the average mangaka's crap.  <br>Some people have shit taste, hard to believe, but it's true. Let's just enjoy the chapter</br>  <br> How can anyone call the art shit? <br>By not being blind.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, When did this manga became a fujobait?</br>  <br>Since always? God I swear /a/nons are the worst trolls on the planet</br>  <br><br> It's amazing and better than the average mangaka's crap. <br>This looks worse than a weekly mangaka art. D.Grayman's art was so much better in Jump than when she moved to SQ everyone suddenly had a potato head and flat faces and you couldn't tell anyone apart anymore.</br></br></br>  Drawfag here<br><br>Hoshino's drawing skill is really good. But she is really indecisive to the point she puts details to everywhere, including where shouldn't</br></br>  <br> Drawfag here <br> Hoshino's drawing skill is really good. <br>You must be a shitty artist</br></br></br>  <br>Keep trying</br>  I thought there was some contract deal that was fucking the artist over, and that was why the D was in manga limbo.<br><br>Was that not the case, or am I just Pooh brain?<br><br>Fucking happy as all hell to see it coming back though. One of the first manga I ever read.<br><br><br><br>Fuck yes best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Chapter ends with Allen and Earl hugging <br>Whaat?!\<br><br>Can't wait for the translation to see what the heck is going on.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought there was some contract deal that was fucking the artist over, and that was why the D was in manga limbo. <br><br>It was a false rumour<br><br><br>It's just part 1</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's just part 1 <br>I see makes sense.</br></br>  <br>wheres part 2?</br>  <br>Not yet scanned?</br>  <br>Gotta love the transition<br>First volume is still the best cover</br></br>  <br>this cover and volume 19 is my favorites but that one is definitely 3rd.</br>  <br>Second part when?<br><br><br>I felt bad for Mana being there all broken.<br>Now the Earl knows how Mana felt in the past because he broke as well.<br><br>Also a friend pointed to me that yhe one who Mana&amp;Nea's mom was the Earl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also a friend pointed to me that yhe one who Mana&amp;Nea's mom was the Earl. <br>What? That the Earl "killed" Mana &amp; Nea's mom or that he  fucked  her? Because you're missing a crucial verb there.</br></br>  <br>The resonating reaction with Apocryphos has calmed down...<br>/<br>Now then, A date with the Noahs?<br>Well Whatever<br>/<br>... After all, This is the first date in 35 year's.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> puts details to everywhere, including where shouldn't <br><br>really? example?</br></br></br>  <br>Like every page</br>  <br> when <br>implying this werent made with fujos in mind</br></br>  <br>He married their mom when they were kids.<br>She died when Nea became the 14th, isn't clear if the one who killed her was the Earl or Nea himself.</br></br>  <br> Fujos <br>so whats the chances of Kanda's waifu boyfriend alma coming back? Kanda is a general now so he needs a side kick.</br></br>  Why is Allen hugging the Earl? I haven't read this shit in ages.  <br>Yuu is just a normal beautiful person now right? And his Innocence seems to be fucking with him. He can't do that deep/self heal anymore.<br><br> tf your waifu gets a penis </br></br></br>  <br>Alma won't return. He is even deader than Timcanpy</br>  <br> He can't do that deep/self heal anymore. <br>I thought he exhausted all his extra lives?</br></br>  <br> characters staying dead <br>Just look at Tyki Mikk, he should have died 5 times over by now.</br></br>  <br> 65 pages. <br>I pity you, d-gayfags</br></br>  <br> Road: Hey, Listen </br>  <br>How, he is one of the most OP in DGM</br>  <br>Hey I was expecting 30, this is already more than twice of that. it's not that bad</br>  <br>Allen chopped him to pieces a couple of times. Tyki's plot armor is pretty thick.</br>  <br>this. No clue what happened last time, the last 10 or so chapters were a mess to begin with</br>  I fucking hope Neah just totally takes over at some point and wrecks shit. I like Allen and all, but the few times the guy has come to the surface he's been really cool.  Nea is really cute when he is not trying to kill anyone.  <br>He can still regen a little it seem.<br><br>He got memory wipe recently in the story and his ability just get them back right after</br></br></br>  Kanda can still heal himself, it's just his ability isn't as strong as before  <br>I don't understand that though, these last several chapters Hoshino has confused me, and it also seems like he brought Johnny back after Allen/Nea/whoever the fuck he is right now slammed his head.</br>  <br>Kanda's blood has healing power, already shown in Alma arc</br>   my heart <br><br>That was a good chapter, Road was adorable. Glad it's back, though now we have to wait 3 months.</br></br>  <br>That's not the last page. It's not over that easily</br>  I wonder how much she's drawn ahead, I saved this from her Instagram back in November.  <br>Holy shit, its back. How long until translations go up?</br>  I honeslty can't remember the last time I enjoyed reading D gay man. How did the plot get so fucking terrible?  <br>The translation of the first 32 pages are finished</br>  <br>Which group do you work for</br>  <br>3 months is better than togashi infinite hiatus. Ill take it as long as we keep getting this sort of art quality.</br>  <br>None. There are a bunch of translators and editors working together under no group</br>  <br>Since we're all waiting for the manga translation to come out. I got a question. How come the official figure looks like shit for a fairly popular series such as this, and it's not even cheap to boot.</br>  Page 1~32 Translation:<br> https://mangahelpers.com/forum/sho<wbr>wthread.php/80787-DGM-Chapter-219-S<wbr>poiler-Thread?p=4056600&amp;viewfull=1#<wbr>post4056600</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>Didn't it come out in the early days of the manga?</br>  <br>Thanks a lot. This series is my childhood and I'm totally looking forward to it. <br><br>Going to be enjoying every bit of it tomorrow when I wake up.</br></br></br>  <br>this is out like 10 years ago.</br>  80 posts already and that pastAllen pasta anon still hasn't showed up?  <br>is that neah or what he looked like before the white hair thing?<br><br> 65 pages <br>are we always gonna get about this amount of pages everytime? I hate for this to be a one time thing and next month they give like 20-21 pages.</br></br></br></br>  <br> red arm <br>I thought the arm turned to black or was that an anime-only thing?<br>and gotdammit get some nailclippers, holy shit</br></br></br>  <br>that arm stops an axe. How can nail clippers do something</br>  <br> that arm stops an axe <br>I really need to reread this series.</br></br>  <br>Huh? Nea was the Noah of Destruction? Even if it's been so long since the last chapter, I totally don't remember ever having read this before. Must have glossed over it.</br>  <br> next month <br>About that.</br></br>  <br>I meant the next month we get a chapter.</br>  <br>Chapter 198<br><br><br>Krory arc, where Allen regained his left eye</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was struggling cleaning the raw. Here you are<br><br>DGM threadly reminder that Past!Allen is responsible for:<br><br>[x]Musician code along with the song<br>[x]Almost destroying Noah Clan via using 14th<br>[x]Turning Cross's life into shit<br>[x]Turning Allen's life into extreme deep shit<br>[x]Cross's death<br>[x]Lavi turns into wormslut<br>[x]Road made a contract with QB and become magical girl, only for getting Madoka's bless and gone for good<br>[x]Timcanpy's death<br>[x]Not!Shou Tucker raping everyone<br>[x]Turning everyone into gay<br>[x]Link's unrequited gay love <br>[x]Turning Kanda and Alma from straight to gay<br>[x]The manga switches to quarterly<br><br>[for later update]<br><br><br>As we have new chapter, please feel free to add more. Anything is fine</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Allen the most complex mango protags? Or is that Kaneycky guy?  <br>Probably not the most, but more complex than Kaneki. <br><br>He manages to be insane without none of the reader notice until the truth got revealed</br></br></br>  <br> mfw when fatfags says shirou is complex <br>im not talking about you im talking about what makes a compelx character<br><br>but I would say for me its allen, kaneki only has to worry about two sides(humans and ghouls)<br><br>allen has to worry about like 4 sides<br> human <br> noah <br> akuma <br> innocence </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you forgot<br> past!Allen </br></br></br>  <br><br>So what is the most complex manga/anime/LN protagonist?<br> inb4 classic lit </br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking currently happening events.</br>  <br>As how Apocryphos said, past!Allen is like he can rises any moment along with Nea</br>  <br> So what is the most complex manga/anime/LN protagonist? <br> manga/anime/LN <br>woah buddy, thats a long list to go through, and I dont even read LNs.<br>\<br> past!Allen is like he can rises any moment along with Nea <br>what? so he has two people inside him now, fuck I need the vol. t hurry up and be delivered to my library.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And he has Mana's personality in him too</br>  <br>I feel like that's something he adopted. but Im getting a feeling like hes gonna try to save the noahs too.</br>  <br>Well of course, he has to save best girl after all</br>  This is too sad  <br><br>Aw hell, is this confirmed? I thought it was a wrist injury. Arthritis is about the worst thing that can happen to an artist</br></br>  <br>We never know what exactly it was, but she says it's chronic and there were times she felt it was painful just only lying down</br>  <br>Best girl doesn't need save</br>  can't wait to see the next part of the chapter. We only have half of it.  Man I need to reread this shit. I can't remember what happened last time.  Luberier did nothing wrong.  <br>But he actually did NOTHING wrong</br>  Due to Hoshino's recent instagram status, the raw provider probably will postpone uploading the rest  <br>Well shit, what status?</br>  <br>I assume you're talking about the part where Noahs have no dick.</br>  <br>That's just how they roll</br>  <br> どういうルートなのか分からないですが、発売日前の漫画を投稿しないで欲<wbr>しいです…。インスタは画像が主体の場なので、余計に…マナーがあると信じ<wbr>たいです。</wbr></wbr> <br> Although I do not know how, I wish my manga wouldn't be posted before its release date....Because the images are a big subject on instagram.... I want to believe there are still manners. </br></br>  <br>B-but they're supposed to breed human</br>  <br>Ok that's kind of sad now</br>  <br>Ah, I agree with her then. If its a sketch or in progress panels just showing her work I guess she wont mind.</br>  <br>That make sense, it's her long await revival after all.</br>  <br>Ah, instagram, the haven of art theft.</br>  <br>She actually minds after she learns that posting them gives editorial department troubles. She did that because she didn't know.<br><br>Is it just me or it's even sadder that she just doesn't want her works to be leaked before the release day</br></br></br>  HOLY FUCKING HYPE SHILLS  <br>Okay so, what the actual fuck is going on? I remember it starting off pretty neat, and then when they picked up the vampire dude things went south of fucking bananas in terms of story. I don't remember anything that happened past that part because it's all such a jumbled mess.</br>  <br>What in the fuck am I reading?</br>  <br>Welp, I guess we wont be seeing her work on current chapter from now on, its also a spoiler to the readers too. Pretty sad since I really like to see anons posting this <br>kind of work in progress pics.<br><br>Most raws are usually from the release day or after a day or two right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>DGM raws/spoiler are usually out before the official release 3-4 days.</br>  <br>I'm crying ;_;</br>  <br>Pathetic</br>  The chapter is pretty much easier to understand than Alma arc to me. Why so much "what the fuck is going on?"  <br>because no one remembers shit<br> <br>no one is complaining about the art, she is a high skilled artist</br></br></br>  <br> the rest <br>So the OP scans aren't complete yet?</br></br>  <br>They also try to read a raw chapter without understanding moonrunes.</br>  <br>33/65 pages</br>  The rest seems to be up  HOLY SHIT THIS IS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL  MANA IS THE EARL CONFIRMED <br>A<br>N<br>A<br><br>I<br>S<br><br>T<br>H<br>E<br><br>E<br>A<br>R<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meh, digital colouring still can't beat the real thing.<br>She sure is great at it though, I'd need a decade to get around her level.</br></br>  <br>Most be tough being blind</br>  <br>Her carpal tunnel better not return.</br>  <br>its chronic I think.<br><br><br><br>sweet, now time to make a d-gray man folder and go look for some d-gray man reaction image.</br></br></br></br></br>  Just read the whole chapter.<br>It's all orge now.<br><br>Allen, you have been living great. It's better for you just to drop dead right there and now before learning the very truth</br></br></br>  <br>She is like a female Miura</br>   &gt;In these 7000 years, only once did the Millennium Earl disappear from this Earth.<br> Suddenly, on the ground, there remained only the wind... as well as... <br> Do you understand? <br> That was the two of us, Mana and Neah. <br><br> The two of us were originally one person: THE EARL OF MILLENIUM <br/></br></br></br></br></br>   <br>Hahaha this motherfucking twist.</br>  <br>   &gt;The two of us were originally one person: THE EARL OF MILLENIUM<br>  </br> <br><br>JESUS<br>FUCKING<br>CHRIST</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>What the fuck?</br>  where's the second part of the scans then? PLEASE! <br><br>can anyone confirm that spoiler?</br></br>    <br>The second part got deleted due to this <br>And yes, it's true</br></br>  <br>What a tweest.</br>  <br>On the scale from 1 to infinity plus, how broken will Allen be</br>  <br><br>She just wants it to end as soon as possible, doesn't it</br></br>  <br>It's true anon.<br><br>Holy fucking shit, despair incoming.</br></br></br>  <br>i think this has been planned since the beginning</br>  <br>It's more like she has been waiting to drop this bomb since the 1st chapter 11 years ago</br>  <br>He is already broken. I swear the amount of pain DGM characters go through is enough to make them kill themselves.</br>    I wanna fuck Kanda  <br>I love it they go through so much pain and still aren't edgy.</br>   I have decided the Earl's human form since the series's begining. <br><br>We have been warned ALL THE TIME</br></br>  <br>Oh god. I for one am going to enjoy Allen in the Earl's side for a while.</br>  <br>I always wanted to Allen to join the Noahs too, they just seem so fun, and then there's the AllenXRoad ship</br>  <br>b-but this guy said </br>  <br> the Earl's human <br>Wait what? That's the Earl on the far right and in the OP? I need to reread this series since it's come back, I literally don't remember a fucking thing that happened near the end</br></br>  <br>You quoted posts from the same person, which is me<br><br>It just got deleted</br></br></br>  <br> which is me <br><br>Hi you.</br></br></br>  I'm so confused, I haven't been able to follow what is going on since way back when they did Kanda's flashback    <br>Wait is it legit over now? The entire series?</br>  <br> Wait is it legit over now? <br>are you retarded?</br></br>  <br> I'm so confused <br><br>we too anon, hagu</br></br></br>  <br>It's just the begining OF TRUE SUFFERING</br>  <br>What? I haven't read this manga since the last chapter before the mangaka became sick and I haven't been following it at all</br>  <br>yes it over, it ended on ch 219</br>  <br> What? I haven't read this manga since the last chapter before the mangaka became sick <br>yeah and this is obviously the first chapter after that. From the chapter you read, do you really think, that from there it would finish in one chapter?</br></br>  <br>honestly? yes</br>  <br> this is obviously the first chapter after that <br> From the chapter you read <br>Literally what? I don't fucking remember whats even going on with this series since I forgot about it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Chapter 220 announced to be in October</br></br>  <br><br>get out</br></br>  <br>It is the "real thing", only digital. Exactly the same fundamentals apply.</br>  I'm gonna marry Lenalee!  <br>That's gay</br>  Would you fuck a grey man?  <br>They are twins.</br>  <br> They are the same person </br>  <br> You haven't read the series since it came out? <br> lol faggot get out fuck you can't enjoy this series </br></br>  <br>The noah.</br>  oh cool an update, just to shatter our hopes and dreams by leaving just hanging for couple another years again.  <br>I put the D in the title.</br>  <br>Lenalee a shit</br>  <br> Series comes back <br> lel is it really over? <br>Are you a legit reallife autist?</br></br></br>  <br>All I know is that it has comeback, I don't know how many chapters been released, I don't know what the mangaka is doing. For all I know she ended it in one chapter or some shit and  was the last page. I don't fucking remember, I already stated I haven't been following the series at all.</br>  <br><br>Please just stop</br></br>  <br>then google it or read the thread before posting retarded shit you subhuman.</br>  <br>They're literally the same person. It's like talking to that angry little voice in your head. <br><br>Honestly don't know how this manga got swarmed by fujos. It looked like a typical shonen when I first read it. It just has a lot of male characters, but the homo hints are way way low.</br></br></br>  <br> You're subhuman for asking a simple question <br>Go back to /v/</br></br>  <br>No you're a subhuman for being to ignorant to at least inform yourself before being a retard.

Have you seen her draw something other than Dgm? Because she is skilled as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How come he used the word subhuman without knowing /pol/ ?<br>Sounds fishy to me.</br></br></br>  <br>You better delete your post to save your face</br>  <br>They are just some autists tryhards, don't pay attention. Her skills are amazing</br>  <br> Any real artist or scholar <br>Which isn't your case, autist wannabe</br></br>  <br>The creator of Berserk? Nah, he takes his time and all, and he's a lazyfuck, but he does excellent drawings, sadly, D.Gray-Man hasn't gotten any better in years.</br>  <br>You're spending your time making up bait to "troll" people on the internet</br>  <br><br>What face ?<br>My anonymous one ?</br></br></br>  <br>I hope you're provoking for a reason.</br>  holy shit will Berserk next chapter be this impacting regarding the series too?  I don't even remember what was going on in this manga anymore.  <br>We're all confused anon. Just do some re-reading and it'll (probably) make sense.</br>  <br><br>Anon i advice you to take things less seriously in here.<br>we probably agreed on many subjects in other threads or maybe even here, since i samefagged.</br></br></br>  <br>just remove yourself from here</br>  To the guy who read all the chapter already: does Lavi appears? Pls respond this is important to me.  <br>Not the one you're requesting, but I saw Lavi in the WIP images on the author's twitter, so he most liekly appears in this or the next few chapters. Th eodd thing is that  he was with the MC. </br>  <br><br>Leave him alone he's probably a newfag.</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>thank you so much  ;_; <br>I'm really hoping for at least a fucking panel with Levi</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is the context behind this</br>  <br> Fiddler (The Noah with eyeballs tounge) is drawing fan art of Lavi and his worms  </br>  <br> Levi </br>  <br> I want Lavi to be raped with worms </br>  <br> autism </br>  Lavi pretty much had mind break by now  Come on where's the translatorfags with the summary  <br>The whole chapter can be summed up in one sentence  Mana is the Earl </br>    So why the fuck does Tykki look like Neah? <br><br>  in before "muh sameface"  <br><br>Its intentional because Wisely mentions it when he wakes up only for Road to stop him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cloning, past!Allening</br>  <br>My dick is so confused</br>  <br>we know this already, that's not what I asked and this isn't a summary eat a dick</br>  <br> Its intentional <br>These DGMfags sure are delusional</br></br>  <br>Why bait?</br>  <br>And Allen called Nea "Tyki" in chapter 198 too</br>  <br>Pic related.</br>  <br>And another one.</br>  <br><br> replying to bait </br></br>  <br>There are a lot of shitposters on DGM threads and I actually want to discuss this without some others copying the guy/samefagging. Easier to just post the proof.</br>  <br>Poor Wisely is going to have a major migraine when he learns the truth.</br>  <br> don't know how this manga got swarmed by fujos <br>Well the author is a fujo</br></br>  lavi  <br> All this suffering <br> The implications <br> It is only the first chapter <br>I want to get off of Ms.Hoshino Wild Ride.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the only one.<br>Do you wish for more?</br></br>  <br> fujos <br><br><br> fujo </br></br></br></br>  <br>Has Nea seen Tyki in person yet? I wonder what his reaction will be.</br>  <br>no, die, degenerate</br>  Is mangastream still translating this?  Post Allen's reaction face when he learns about this   <br>I'm sure it'll fade by the time the next chapter comes out, surprised anyone's bothering.</br>  <br>You have 3 months to try and get off before the next swerve comes</br>  <br>They said they would consider if the manga really returned</br>  Time tor read this shit all over again<br> best girl of all best returns, what could possibly be better? </br>  <br>He went through Allen's memories so he should have seen him. Plus Tykki was in the area when Neah took over Allen to shit talk the Earl in the Alma-Kanda arc, though he was probably too preoccupied with Earl.</br>  If Allen is really Millennium Earl why the Noah, Demons, Neah, Count himself, the author literally everybody were trying to kill him?  <br>The last few DGm threads only has minimal shitposting. It was only today that we got tons of people trying to convince us we are blind for liking her art.</br>  <br> Honestly don't know how this manga got swarmed by fujos <br>Her style regressed to looking like something you'd find out of a yaoi manga, it doesn't surprise me. I miss her old style, she was one of my favourites.</br></br>  <br>she never went missing anon!</br>  does anyone have that page where allen blushes but the blush is all over the fucking page, I need it for an argument.  <br> tons of people <br>Learn how to count. Tons is not singular word</br></br>  This finally makes sense.  <br>Oh shit.</br>  <br>Road's known the truth for a while now.</br>  <br>  That face when the human you're interested in has the memory of the traitorfag Noah </br>  <br>Omg, thats funny because that's exactly what happened to deadman Wonderland. It ended in one chapter with the worst end of all time. Good thing is I think hoshino actually cares too much about her work to do that.</br>  <br> Omg <br>They are here, among us.<br>Beware the Fujos</br></br></br>  Im still mad lenalee hair got cut short.  <br>Don't think Road cares all that much.</br>  <br> because that's exactly what happened to deadman Wonderland <br>no it's not. DW had no break before the last chapter.</br></br>  <br>wasn't it burnt? she's growing it out.</br>  <br>You are right probably, I forgot most if not all of the "why" in this series.</br>  I want to cum in the Earl's hair  <br>I really do wonder how Tykki fits into all of this, maybe he was supposed to be the 14th natural host or something but the implantation into Allen screwed it up? Random triplet? We know that Allen's age reversed so ages aren't so certain.</br>  <br>They've been here for a while.<br>It's easy to detect their autistic text pattern.</br></br>  <br>they are even talking about the thread on twitter</br>  <br> implying this board wasn't already infested by fujos </br>  <br>I don't mind as long as they don't shitpost like the tumblrfags that they are</br>  <br> liking the bird <br><br>it seems you are autism anon</br></br></br>  <br>Probably the ones that Hoshino found out about the scans from, they don't understand low radar.</br>   So if Mana is the Earl, what was the robot skeleton that Allen killed?   <br>I do care. I don't like the idea to hold a conversation with someone who has a tumblr.</br>  <br>Split soul</br>  <br> ohh he posted a reaction image from an anime he probably likes it what a fag <br>Look I'm posting this guy I probably like Game of Thrones huh?</br></br>  <br>Hoshino saw it on instagram. The best thing we can do is support now is support the publication and not leak the second part.</br>  <br>See? You have autism.</br>  <br>Hoshino said the leaks are mostly in Instagram. I checked, and the majority of posters are Chinese and Korean.</br>  <br>why not?</br>  So now the next big questions is, who has he Heart?  <br>My bet is on Past!Allen</br>  <br>I'm going to go out on a limb and Say no one we know of has it. and I'll go farther and say "the Heart" isn't real</br>  <br>so the millennium earl</br>  <br>I'm thinking Lavi.<br>I like this  idea too. What a twist it would be.</br></br>  Why is Lavi capt again?  <br><br>So her art is just shit?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much</br>  <br>it looks more like scans are shit. the grain .</br>  <br>Someone close to Allen, since Apocryphos see's Allen as a threat</br>  <br> Lenalee </br>  <br> Lanelee <br> important to allen <br>shes friend-zoned so hard she isn't leaving, It'll probably be Johnny.</br></br></br>  <br>Since the original Allen seems to have planned this all out, I'm betting on him having found it a long time ago and hid it. Maybe somewhere on the ark?</br>  <br>Its timcanpy.</br>  <br>Maybe that was suggested when her innocence protected her, but I think it'll be someone less obvious <br><br>nah Johnny doesn't have an innocence</br></br></br>  <br>Apo sees Nea as the threat, not Allen and actually tries to save Allen, in a unique way though.</br>  <br> Friend <br> Not important </br></br>  <br>yeah I know, just a little bit of laziness on my part</br>  <br>Apo comunicates with it, Road fears of it. <br>It does exists</br></br>  <br>Poor guy's going to crack, maybe he'll just start laughing?</br>  <br>Sorry but Lanelee isn't going to be important. shes as important as Krory. <br><br>well the Heart could be a person instead of an innocence</br></br></br>  <br>Cross, since he is alive</br>  <br>is this confirmed? I always thought he was alive but...</br>  I just think Ufotable should make a D Gray Man remake and sell like water.  <br>fucking chinese and korean fujos <br><br>come on no one saved the full chapter?</br></br></br>  <br>Lavi is impossible since he is wormslut now. Apocrypha would be much more panicky if The Heart got kidnapped by Noahs</br>  <br>At this point in time even Kanda is closer.</br>  <br>it comes out officially friday. wait a couple of days.</br>  <br>but Apo either did or tired to kill him, or do you mean the innocence he carried?</br>  <br>Fujos have too much loyalty to each other anon.</br>  Haha wow.  <br>.....what?</br>  <br>Let's be honest, this twist was a long time coming.</br>  <br>The old Earl disappeared and became the two babies.</br>  <br>What</br>  <br>At least it was well foreshadowed.</br>  <br>One can dream. It would be amazing.</br>  <br>please post the full thing you cocksucker</br>  <br> Let's be honest, this twist was a long time coming </br>  <br>Please, did you see how badly /a/ shitposted the God Eater threads? And the first episode wasn't even that bad. Things world be 10x worst with Dgrayman ones since it has actual fujobait</br>   Among the grey ashes in the flames shining...First one, then two ... <br><br>HOSHINOOO</br></br>    Your face when your husbando turns into two babies. <br><br>She then goes and adopts them. Katherina best waifu.</br></br>  <br> fujo bait <br>This again. How is Dgm fujo?</br></br>  <br>Holy shit it's like Hoshino's art changes every page.</br>  <br>Apart from the whole Alma arc...I don't know.</br>  <br>I want to give Katherina her own child. <br><br>Shame she dead.</br></br></br>  <br>lots of pretty boys working hard together and getting sweaty with each other</br>    <br>You just described most shounen manga out there.</br>  <br>People trying to force shit on D Gray Man <br><br><br>No anon, God Eater is awful. I never saw /a/ agreeing like that before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because it has lots of pretty boys. In fact by /a/ standards nowadays any show that has a high number of male cast than females is fujobait, doesn't even need for the guys to look good. This place is getting shittier by the day.</br>  <br>Yes, so in the end anything can be taken as "fujo", which is ridiculous. People saying that are pretty much autists or epik trolls thinking they are funny as <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128131220 </br>  <br>As a self proclaim fujo I am appalled as to why they called Kekkai fujobait last season.</br>  <br><br>Tiki may be a "carrier" for Mana as Allen was for Neah.</br></br>  <br> As a grill I am <br>Fucking stop.</br></br>    Thread died when the fujis revealed themselves. They truly are the plague.  <br>DGM has always had fujoshits, where have you been?<br><br><br>Many of them cite the Ark arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We are doomed. Can't we have nice things, anon?</br>  <br>Remember when she was the strongest Exorcist for a minute?</br>  <br> Remember when she was the strongest Exorcist for a minute? <br>nope cause there's master class.</br></br>  <br><br>for the life of me I cant picture girls on /a/, Like I know they're there just can't see it.</br></br>  <br>yes, I love her</br>  <br>You mean the group of 10 or so top level exorcists? IIRC, those guys were a bunch of chumps.</br>  <br> allens master <br> chump <br>nope.</br></br></br>  <br>Leenalee was never the strongest. The generals were always stronger, but they had to be taken out by the Noah themselves. Allen was always stronger as was Cross and Kanda.</br>  <br>Weren´t they trying to destroy humanity through mass murder?<br><br>What was with that!</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember too much from the series, but wasn't she  used goods? Not that I care or anything. </br>  <br>Wasn't Leenalee the first one to super exorcist lvl 3?<br><br><br>No, her brother would have prevented that.</br></br></br></br>  So this chapter had the revelation that Mana is half of the Earl and Nea is the other half. Why did the Earl split into two and who was the Mana thay Allen traveled with? Is it some sort of good/evil thimg and clown!Mana was the good half (albeit insane) or was it Earl!Mana the whole time?  I don't get it.<br>Then, who in the hell Allen called back in akuma skeleton and got his scar?<br>If Mana and Nea is Earl, how Allen called Mana's soul?</br></br>  <br>Also...who's Allen now? Is Allen a person, was he ever a person? <br><br>feels like Pandora hearts with Oz now</br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it was Allen's imagination or something because why would Mana/the Earl scream "you made me into an Akuma!" I doubt that's possible. My biggest question if it did happen is why did the Earl appear to Allen if it was him Allen had lost. I'm thinking the Earl has a clear split personality, too becuase otherwise...<br><br>My feelings exactly (and I love DGM for it)</br></br></br>  <br>You mean a lvl 3 akuma, it wasn't really anything special, just the first time that the group had come across one. Also she nearly died fighting it.</br>  <br>Simple that akuma didn't have Mana's soul.</br>  <br>Then how did it know Allen's name?</br>  <br><br>me, personally I would just chalk it up to being an hallucination.</br></br>  <br>or bother saying "I Love You."</br>  <br>It might have been someone he knew but we know for sure that it wasn't Mana.</br>  <br>It being someone else entirely makes less sense than it being Mana. At least the lines would make sense, then. But I think both theories are invalid.<br>I would say the Mana side of the Earl was using the opportunity to talk to Allen one last time without the Earl side knowing but it's impossible to know, with someone in that head clearly having a few screws loose...</br></br>  <br>Mm. Could be the 'human' side of Mana was speaking? Maybe he just never awoke.</br>  <br>What do you mean?</br>  <br>Like, if Mana hadn't awoken yet and it's why Allen was able to call Mana's soul into the Akuma frame. Then the Noah part of Mana's soul awakened after his death somehow and it's why Tyki looks so much like Mana.</br>  <br>I'm sure it'll be explained eventually. Hell she still needs to explain why Tykki looks like Mana and Nea, when his Noah fully activated his hair grew out long as well like Mana and the previous Earl's too.</br>  <br>That's an interesting theory. Like the soul somehow after the incident manifested in the Tykki memory or something?</br>  <br>The only person that's ever made sense to me is that shithead Timothy. His is the only innocence we've seen that has a human-like body and can talk to the kid AND other people if he just takes over Timothy. Allen's may be sentient as well, but Timothy's is almost like a whole developed person and it's fucking weird. It's almost like a crippled version of Apocrophos.<br><br>Also, it's odd how it synchronized with him from being shoved down his throat prior to it activating. His is almost a hybrid of equipment and parasitic because the innocence was in the jewel his dad made him swallow, but then suddenly became a part of his fucking head like a parasite type and again, I don't think we've seen anything like that from another person.</br></br></br>  Allen I hope he doesn't "die" so far hes had a tough life...  <br>I agree with this. Also the heart is smart. Who would suspect a young boy of having it?</br>  <br>  Everyone hates him and his shitty "filler" arc <br>  Turns out he has The Heart <br><br>HOSHINOOOOO</br></br></br></br>  It's been ages since I read D.Gray-man and I remember the story started to confuse me around the "Mystery of Kanda" arc. Does anyone know of a good summary of the series up to the latest chapter? Thanks.  <br>He'll probably be fine by the end, I'm sure Road will do something. He's stuck dreaming or something right now, right? Maybe she'll visit him she's stuck in her dream right now.</br>  Been rereading on and off all day, I really have to wonder how Link plays into all of this.  <br>yeah that scene was really weird.</br>    <br>so is there more?</br>      <br>Now I wonder which one of them is the craziest.</br>  The theory about Mana looking like the Earl turns out to be truth because Mana IS the Earl.<br><br>Fuck. So when the "Earl" killed Nea it WAS Mana himself killing his own brother which in turn makes sense as to why both the "Earl" and Mana were broken at the same time.<br><br>Oh shit.<br><br>We saw this coming we just needed a way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both probably pretty mad, they each have half a Noah memory. Maybe they'll become one again somehow?</br>  Scanaltion thread<br> What are you working on <br> Why aren't you working on it </br></br>  Scanlation bulletin:<br>tiny<br>url.com/ScanlationBulletin</br></br>  bump   Why aren't you working on it <br>Too much effort<br>Most of the readers don't give a fuck about the quality, only care about faster releases</br></br>  <br>I care, anon</br>  <br>You know what, I'm starting to feel that way recently. /a/ is about the only place that cares about quality, oftentimes autistically so.</br>  <br>They don't even agree on what quality is though. There was that one anon earlier today who actually thought you should take out all the periods at the end of the bubbles.</br>  <br><br>Should have the first chapter of https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=14972 out soon.<br><br><br><br>This, no one else except /a/ cares enough to complain about releasing chapters in .jpg even when the raws are such, or about lack of full stops at the end of sentences in bubbles.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Working on /a/: the manga.  Do we really need this thread every other day?  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  <br>I've seen an officially licensed series that did that.  It wasn't in English. </br>  <br><br> Implying anything wrong with that <br><br>They just look retarded in bubbles with comic fonts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you're doing the new james hotate manga.</br>  <br><br>It's already done as of yesterday. Will have to wait till next month probably though to see if it ends up being a decent series or not, but seems to have potential.<br><br>Though got the raws for it from some random Korean site some anon linked, hopefully can actually find the next ones.</br></br></br></br>  <br> complain about releasing chapters in .jpg even when the raws are such <br>unless it's in color, an indexed .png will save in filesize while keeping (about) the same quality</br></br>  <br>You're supposed to only put in period in one or two-word bubbles</br>  Surprised Dungeon Meshi only has 1 chapter out. I see it being promoted in every book store with a sample pages. Seemed like it was popular.  <br>It was weird how that was on the top page of Honto.jp's manga ranking during the new years.</br>  <br>That is the most retarded thing I've seen on /a/ today. Congratulations.</br>  <br><br>Supposedly it has a translator, but the guy who did chapter 1 doesn't care enough to edit it.</br></br>  <br><br>A lot of readers also think that MangaFox is an official manga publisher. Doesn't make it any less retarded.</br></br>  <br>what is the purpose of periods in manga? there is 0 reason to add them except for "it's always been this way"<br><br><br>who?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Though got the raws for it from some random Korean site some anon linked. <br>you're welcome.</br></br>  <br> there is 0 reason to add them except for "it's always been this way" <br>Since English doesn't appear to be your first language, I'd recommend reading a book on grammar. Something for kindergartners should be about your level.</br></br>  <br>We don't use periods in non-print text.

I miss you Ruri...  <br> 5Ds takes place after GX <br>Wrong. 5Ds takes place after DM in a timeline when GX never happened.</br></br>    <br>The AR Vision makes complete sense with the way duels are presented in the universe. They make it a point to show that it's a very casual part of their lives, even having random arguments between people such as when Yuma doesn't tell his sister or grandmother about the parent's meet and we see Yuma's grandmother in a restaurant where two dudes just start arguing and then dueling in the backround. With holograms everywhere, shit would get chaotic for people in daily life. There's no reason whatsoever for them to use holograms when they can make it participants + spectators only. <br><br><br>What makes you say that? BBT is them just jumping in time, not jumping between dimensions.</br></br></br></br>  Sawatari will win. I bet my soul he will win.  They really are trying their best to reenact the fortune cup arc with the friendship cup huh?  <br><br>BBT disagrees with you</br></br>  <br>Just noticed the hands, the image is ruined for me now.

Even NAC says the only source is that post.  <br>Some people will believe anything if it gives them an excuse to shitpost.</br>  <br>No. The Don Pierrot and the other name (Christian?) interested me though<br><br>Those are random names to choose if you were making fake character</br></br></br>  <br><br>All Barians looks the same to me imo</br></br>  <br>....how?</br>  <br>so what you're saying is in the DM timeline which takes place in the Fusion Dimension, GX takes place 10 years later in the same timeline, and Arc-V takes place X number of years after GX in the same timeline?<br><br>Should I assume for 5Ds it takes place in the Synchro Dimension and in a timeline similar to DM (since KC exists) but X number of years after that? <br><br>As for Zexal it's in the Xyz Dimension in a completely different timeline from any of the other series?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/, tell me about Alito, Girag, and Mizael <br><br>Why do they wear the mask on top of the mask?</br></br></br>  <br>actually, 5D's, GX, and DM are all in the same timeline, with 5D's in the distant future after GX.</br>  <br>no astral worlders cared who they were until they put on the extra masks.</br>  <br>If I take off their masks, will they die?</br>  <br><br>DM-&gt;GX-&gt;5D's is one coherent timeline<br>ZeXal is whatever<br>and Arc-V seems to be an alternate timeline altogether though the various dimensions seem to be based on the different eras of YGO and Arc-V seems to take place parallel to 5D's timeline seeing how Jack and Crow are alive yet we haven't seen any other YGO characters, although all other dimensions were introduced before Synchro.<br><br>Arc-V will probably explain how the dimensions were split into respective summoning methods and maybe we'll get an explanation how it correlates with the other YGO series. And if we don't learn it in the series, maybe we'll learn it through a movie like BBT.<br><br>My theory is that the dimension split happened some time in GX because Yubel and her dimension fusion shenanigans and X years later which would regularly be the 5D's plot Arc-V takes place just with the dimensions split into their respective summoning methods.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL</br>  <br>no.</br>  <br>Done :^)</br>  <br><br>It's a not so distant future actually. Ushio is in 5D's is the same guy as the school bully from DM</br></br>  <br>Looks like Mizael doesn't want to be there.</br>  <br><br> middle schoolers hellbent on destroying the world with trading cards </br></br>  <br>mizael was a next-level cunt.</br>  <br>He doesn't</br>  <br>I wonder if Zexal's popularity means we'll get a movie that actually explains what happened when they flew away.</br>  <br>He can handle it, he's a big guy</br>  <br>did we ever get resolution on whether yusei became a good doctor?<br><br>or what happened to yugi after atem passed on?<br><br>or whether or not judai won his duel?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Completed series getting a movie <br>I don't think that's how it works, DM nostalgia nonwithstanding</br></br>  <br> did we ever get resolution on whether yusei became a good doctor? <br>Yusei didnt become a doctor you dumbass<br><br> or what happened to yugi after atem passed on? <br>Literally the 2016 movie you dumbass<br><br> or whether or not judai won his duel? <br>He had no cards in his hand or field that could stop Slifer, he lost, you dumbass</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Was ZeXal really all that popular? I know it had high ratings but the japanese fanbase doesn't seem to like ZeXal either. <br>I guess there is a reason why they go back to 5D's pandering and pretend ZeXal never existed</br></br></br>  <br><br>A Ph. D is also a doctor you know</br></br>  <br>So is it possible to look at it this way then?<br><br>DM-&gt;GX-&gt;5Ds is all in one timeline in one dimension.<br><br>Zexal is completely different timeline in a completely different dimension.<br><br>Arc-V is in a completely different dimension too called the Standard Dimension but there are the other Summoning Method Dimensions in the same plane? And in some of these Dimensions are timelines that exist parallel to stuff in the DM dimension? Like how the Synchro Dimension has Jack and Crow although they're different from 5Ds Jack and Crow?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no cards in his hand or field that could stop slifer <br> judai was the one attacking <br> and he had cards in hand </br></br></br>  <br> Yusei didnt become a doctor you dumbass <br>Yusei was a doctor, just not a medical one<br><br> He had no cards in his hand or field that could stop Slifer, he lost, you dumbass <br>Slifer would have died end of turn because it was special summoned</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everything related to the first three worlds is an alternate timeline from Arc-V, so that point is moot. <br><br>Holy shit you are retarded</br></br></br>  <br> pretend ZeXal never existed <br> Heartland references <br> same school uniform with inverted colors <br>Pretty sure that's just your delusion. The new arc is specifically about the Synchro dimension, which is why they're there. Not only that but 5Ds got shitty as fuck rating in Japan, Zexal is alot more popular, but also too recent to make a throwback to already.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but the japanese fanbase doesn't seem to like ZeXal either. <br><br>That's wrong though.</br></br></br>  <br> would have <br><br>Keywords</br></br></br>  <br>that's exactly it.<br><br><br>are you?<br><br><br> yusei didn't become a doctor <br>yes....he did? not a medical doctor, but he became a doctor<br><br> no cards in his hand or field to stop slifer <br>judai's entire schtick was powering up his own monsters, and he had honest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Zexal is completely different timeline in a completely different dimension <br>Where are you getting this from? There still aren't any contradictions made between GX and Zexal, while references are drawn specifically to the monsters used in those. Kaito used both Ritual and Fusion summoning as well.</br></br>  <br><br>It is heavily implied that the dimensions in Arc-V were forcefully split and it used to be one single dimension. Who knows how long that was ago in Arc-V timeline. <br><br>It's basically an alternate universe that was split into 4 alternate universes on top of that. Or it's an alternate universe BECAUSE it was split into 4 alternate universes. Who knows. That's what the show is about and we're trying to figure out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everything in your post is wrong.<br><br>Zexal was more popular than 5Ds<br><br><br>Guys I'm 100% sure all this stuff you are speculating about how dimensions work isn't even occuring to the writers right now. They don't think of this stuff to the level of extreme detail like we do</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>whee did it say he had honest<br><br>didnt honest die</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean aside from little children. Among the 2ch crowd or any dedicated YGO fanbase ZeXal seems to be hugely unpopular</br></br>  <br>This anon is totally tsun for the other one</br>  <br>And you're getting this from?</br>  <br> kaito used fusion summoning <br>uh...when?<br>I know he used rituals, but at this point, we've yet to learn whether or not rituals have their own world.<br><br> there still aren't any contradictions between gx and zexal <br>technology progressed completely differently. in GX world, synchros were discovered, which led to the nuking and eventual emergence of the meklords, while in Zexal, d-gazers and Xyz summons became the norm, with no references EVER to synchro summons.<br><br><br> didn't honest die <br>...no? judai used honest to beat DARKNESS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize that little kids are the only art of the fanbase that actually matter right?</br>  <br><br>Opinions from japanese people</br></br>  <br> He had no cards in his hand or field that could stop Slifer, he lost, you dumbass <br><br><br> &gt;no cards in his hand or field that could stop slifer <br> &gt;judai was the one attacking <br> &gt;and he had cards in hand <br><br>You guys are missing the point. It doesn't matter what cards he had/didn't have in his hand. He lost. It's implied when he says "Yugi-san, I'll become stronger.... Until that time...."<br><br>He wouldn't need to say that if he beat Yugi. Thematically speaking him losing to Yugi makes sense too because it was the spark he needed to get his love for dueling back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>him seeing yugi's excitement alone already gave him his love, his attitude towards the duel completely changes by the end of the vision.</br>  <br> or any dedicated YGO fanbase ZeXal <br><br>And again, you're wrong. Zexal is still one of the most popular behind only DM at this point. Hell it's only previous show getting consistent fanart and discussion despite the fact that it's over already.</br></br></br>  <br> uh...when? <br>Photon Twin Lizard. <br><br>Zexal takes place in a timeline different from 5Ds. They intentionally left out any references to 5Ds, but they had a small story dedicated to the previous legendary monsters used in GX and DM. Since there are no contradictions and the summoning methods are the same, it's safe to say that there was no intention to make it take place in a different universe altogether.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean aside from little children. <br>Why would you be considering opinions other than small children?<br><br>You know "children's card game" is very literal right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure sounds reliable. Zexal is incredibly popular, and has been since around the time Shingetsu revealed himself.</br>  <br> Zexal is still one of the most popular behind only DM at this point. <br>No, GX is still the second most popular.</br></br>  <br>in that case, perhaps a diverging timeline thanks to the time travel shenanigans in BBT?</br>  <br>Fujos (i.e the majority of the adult Yugioh fanbase) love the shit out of it</br>  <br>Something like that, but I doubt there's an actual cause for it. Like 5Ds is just events that happen after GX if they discover Ener-D or something, whereas Zexal is if nothing world-threatening at all happened for really long because there were no Synchros to destroy everything.</br>  <br>Fujo opinions don't matter. They love every season.</br>  <br>Huh? Even Zexal reruns get better ratings.</br>  Tfw Yuzu and Yugo are going to leap in to protect unconscious Yuya<br><br>Tfw Yuya will never know he was so close to Yuzu</br></br>  <br>Are you actually retarded. Not only does the Bonds Beyond Time movie explicitly show 5D's and GX to be in the same universe, there are a bunch of references to GX<br><br>Pic fucking related</br></br></br>  <br>Zexal was wildly popular in Japan but despised everywhere else.5Ds was wildly popular in the USA but not very popular in Japan.</br>  <br>It's not, Zexal is more popular than GX in Japan.</br>  <br><br> Hell it's only previous show getting consistent fanart and discussion despite the fact that it's over already. <br><br> Number of fanart pics with the DM tag on pixiv: 48508 <br> Number of fanart pics with the 5D's tag on pixiv: 18376 <br> Number of fanart pics with the ZeXal tag on pixiv: 15080 <br><br>Yeah sure<br><br> tfw nobody cares about GX <br> 10513 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There still aren't any contradictions made between GX and Zexal <br>Besides the fact that Yugi and Jaden both met Yusei, the same Yusei who came from the future where Synchro Summoning, Fusion Summoning, and regular Summoning are prominent? <br><br> oh they referenced these monsters <br><br>Woop-to-fucking-doody do. Arc-V did the same thing. Nothing in ZEXAL screams same timeline as DM/GX. The Duel Disks don't even have similarities besides the pads. The technology is completely different, no mentioning of anything that happened in DM/GX, none of the same lore as DM/GX, people don't even use monsters from DM/GX besides the Duel Lodge thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gx is easily the most unpopular YGO in Japan. By a margin</br></br>  <br>Trash taste that fits them perfectly</br>  <br> Gx is easily the most unpopular YGO in Japan. By a margin <br>Keep believing that, sport.</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't bracelet-kun zap Yuya away?</br>  <br>That's 5Ds anon</br>  <br><br>Note that DM doesn't have it's own tag on pixiv. It's all 遊戯王 with 5D's, ZeXal and GX being child tags.<br>So according to pixiv among the YGO spinoffs 5D's is at the top and GX at the bottom</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Huh? Even Zexal reruns get better ratings. <br>Please prove it. <br><br>We know Zexal's average ratings against GX's. They don't even compare.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Yugi and Jaden both met Yusei <br>Different timeline, something which you don't seem to grasp. Zexal is simply if the events of 5Ds never happened.<br><br>ARC-V simply showed them as monsters, not monsters with legendary legacies that an old man would spend years making statues out of because of how important they were. Nothing in Zexal screams DM/GX, but they make direct references to it. The technology is not completely different, it's further in the past to the point where duels went from sports to being as normal as eating food. The events of DM/GX very clearly take place far further in the past for them to achieve legacy status. They do present another similar lore to DM/GX which is Shadow Duels specifically using magical tablets when prominent figures are fighting against eachother. Hell, they even call it a Yami no Game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure what you think these numbers mean considering Zexal is the second newest show and fanartists post new shit all the time, especially on twitter.</br>  Can any single one of you people actually back up your claims with evidence that doesn't involve "I read posts on 2ch" and "number of fanarts"? <br><br>Like any actual numbers, TV ratings,sales or something? Cause this entire discussion is sounding incredibly stupid</br></br>  Currently 6 episodes into 5Ds. Can't believe that they actually aired some of this stuff, like the police brutality against Yusei. <br> It only heightens my desire for a full on serious mode dystopian cyberpunk Yugioh </br>  I'm glad we are having so much discussion that hasn't anything to do with Ruris  <br>I personally surveyed every human being in Japan and they told me that Duel Monsters was the worst Yugioh series and Zexal was the best.</br>  <br> Different timeline, something which you don't seem to grasp. <br>What in ZEXAL suggests ZEXAL is a different timeline of DM-&gt;GX-ZEXAL?</br></br>  <br>We spent like three whole threads talking about Sawatari vs Yuzu, there's really nothing left to do but shitpost about Zexal and pray to god that Crow jobs</br>  <br>I meant not being in the same timeline as GX -&gt; 5Ds and instead diverging to GX -&gt; Zexal.</br>  <br> Can any single one of you people actually back up your claims <br>I dont think they can. I'm pretty sure certain "facts" get repeated on here so often that people assume they're true</br></br>  <br> They do present another similar lore to DM/GX which is Shadow Duels specifically using magical tablets when prominent figures are fighting against eachother. Hell, they even call it a Yami no Game. <br>They have done that even in the mangas. The only series that hasn't had a Shadow Duel is Arc-V</br></br>  <br>So what? The point is that it's a very clear reference to DM, as sealing monsters within the tablets wouldn't have become a thing without DM.</br>  What do you think of new Anzu?  <br>Yes, and I'm asking what suggests that?</br>  <br>Did someone say Ruris?</br>    <br> The only series that hasn't had a Shadow Duel is Arc-V <br>I wouldn't be too sure.<br><br>The carding technology Academia uses lets out the same pink miasma we see come from Yuzu's bracelet.<br><br>So the duels we see are weaponized shadow duels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that they intentionally avoid anything relating to 5Ds while actively referencing DM and GX. The only world-ending catastrophe that happened after GX was because of Synchros, so it's natural that things like that wouldn't happen without Synchros.</br>  <br><br>Even IF ZeXal were to get 3000+ new fanart pics on pixiv even with Arc-V currently running and it getting all the new focus it would still be only equal to 5D's (and that assuming of course that 5D's would get absolutely no new fanart pics on pixic despite currently a lot of new pics with the 5D's tag being created thanks to ZeXal). <br><br>So saying ZeXal is the ONLY one that gets consistent fanart is just absolutely retarded which is what these numbers prove.</br></br></br></br>    Where the fuck are people getting the rating figures for the YGO shows for Japan from anyway?  <br> Shadow Duels <br><br>Literally every Yu-Gi-Oh story bar Arc-V has had Shadow Duels, even the old games on the PS2 and such. I'm talking about the actual lore like in GX when they explicitly say multiple times that there are only 12 dimensions and they were all touched upon in the Yubel story yet ZEXAL comes and introduces 2 more dimensions.</br></br></br>    <br>They are literally making it up</br>  <br>Literally for what reason would they bring up those events specifically? They already showed the monsters involved in those events and called them legendary, which very obviously means they did something to achieve that status. Shadow Duels literally would not exist if it wasn't for DM, so if it took place seperately to that then it wouldn't have been in the series at all.</br>  <br>I am every person from Japan and we're here to tell you that I think 5Ds sucks and we'll never watch anything to do with card games on motorcycles again</br>  <br>I want to go out on a date with a Ruri.</br>  <br><br>Well if anyone can read moon this is all I've found<br><br>http://sakuhindb.com/janime/7_YUGIO<wbr>H_20ZEXAL/<br>http://sakuhindb.com/janime/7_Yougi<wbr>o_20five_20ds/<br><br>I can't read moon but it seems the reception for 5D's was better but that's me looking at graphs I don't understand</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well for one thing, there was that poll at AFA that had Zexal at top 30. I think ARC-V got top 30 or something.</br>  <br>I don't know if it's the nose or the eyes that making it weird. That's not official, right?</br>  <br>Nigga you just said ZEXAL is after GX in its own timeline yet ZEXAL fucks up the lore that GX established. <br><br>ZEXAL has its own lore that doesn't make any connections to DM OR GX bar Shadow Duels. And Shadow Duels are literally just duels with a life or death condition. Just because ZEXAL has Shadow Duels doesn't mean its automatically connected to DM and GX. <br><br>In ZEXAL, a fucking dragon created the universe. That in itself makes it a completely different universe than DM and GX.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can't believe how anyone would even believe ZeXal shitposters. 5D's got a fucking movie. How the fuck can anyone think it was not popular in Japan?</br></br>  <br>I told them it wasn't, and I'm always right</br>  <br> That's not official, right <br>It is, they've revealed some sketches</br></br>  <br> yet ZEXAL fucks up the lore that GX established. <br>What. When? <br><br> In ZEXAL, a fucking dragon created the universe <br>The universe started with a card, the Numeron Code. In GX in the duel against DARKNESS, they say the exact same thing. How is this contradictory?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally out of their ass</br></br>  <br> In ZEXAL, a fucking dragon created the universe <br>I agree with you in that I think Zexal is its own completely different thing, but an undisclosed card created the universe in GX</br></br>  <br>Well she's 2ayy4me.</br>  <br>What? If you mean BBT that's because of the 10th anniversary of the original DM anime, not because of 5Ds specifically. <br><br>Unless you mean that Stardust/Red Dragon Accelerator OVA</br></br></br>  <br>No, the Numeron Dragon created the universe. Life and all the rest of reality was made by the Numeron Code when it hit Earth.<br><br>DARKNESS says the universe was created by a card.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Fucking GXfags, not even Zexalfags are that bad. They even admite the first part of Zexal is shit, but OH! god forbid someone say something bad about GX! because the GX defense force begin their witchhunt.</br></br></br>  <br>The reason its estimated that 5Ds was not as popular in Japan as its contemporaries was that it's average ratings were at a lower average compared to the other ones. it's also speculated because of how very little Synchro support came out for it after it ended compared to getting a bunch of new Fusions, notably HEROes<br><br>Also, it was a custom to rerun the previous series at some point during a new series but this never happened with 5Ds. During Zexal, they reran GX again.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, I don't particularly like GX. Actually, I haven't even finished it. I'm just quite sure that it was the second most popular, certainly not the most unpopular</br>  <br><br>Funny thing is Darkness also told Jaden of the world in ruin at an undisclosed time<br><br>I wonder what he was talking about</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If that's supposed to be an indication of ratings, what about the fact that 5D's got a shit ton of video games released?</br></br>  <br><br>The Numeron Dragon created the universe you dumbasses</br></br>  <br>So did GX and DM?</br>  If anyone is wondering over Zexal's popularity, the link for the actual poll is dead right now. However the most recent standings available in the archive had Zexal at #7-8, and ARC-Vs highest I can find anyone mentioning was it at #30. <br><br>https://archive.moe/_/search/text/a<wbr>nime%20festival%20zexal/<br>It's Anime Festival Tokyo by the way.</br></wbr></br></br>  This question about ratings was asked at NAC once and after navigating baidu somehow, the average ratings were pulled<br><br>Average rating for<br>Original-7.0<br>Gx-3.4<br>5d-2.2<br><br>Zexal average rating for the first half of 2013<br>2.9 <br><br>After that, Zexal moved to a new timeslot and it, along with Arc-V, has no ratings data available. There, now stop fighting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That cover <br> No character songs </br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/122232<wbr>456/#122237032<br>That data is from chinese Youtube or something apparently.</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Yeah but ZeXal didn't. I think it only got that one 3DS game.<br>I think 5D's has the most YGO games (at least if you count Japan only games) though. If you count western stuff, DM is probably on top</br></br></br>  <br>That poll was for best of 2014 and Arc-V had only just started obviously it wouldn't be high up</br>  <br>Reminder Kaito's VA is living the life and is now voicing Slice of Life/Romance animes</br>  Arc V &gt; DM &gt; 5Ds &gt; GX &gt; Zexal  <br>That makes me happy actually. His VA is the most emotional one I've heard, I still hold down his death as one of the best episodes.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JL9<wbr>tL9Ry3sk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  This is a list of ratings up to the end of Zexal I. I've crosschecked a few, so they seem okay. Zexal I is definitely higher than 5D's.<br><br>http://www.geocities.jp/animesityou<wbr>ritu/</wbr></br></br>    <br>He voices this semon demon</br>  I want to card this fucking xyz scum.  <br>I remember when Vector made his big reveal and Pixiv exploded with fanart. <br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm204<wbr>25678<br>I can't blame them, this shit was fucking scary. How did parents let them watch this?</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> death <br>but anon, orbital 7 called him a space ambulance! He's just MISSING!</br></br>  <br>Be honest, would you expect THAT from a show starring fucking Yuma?</br>  Post best girl.    <br>I mean, it was a great moment, but it's not like other shounen don't get away with comparable or worse.</br>    <br>For YGO, that's not really that scary</br>  <br>No, that's it. Like they were fucking around doing their silly Barian Police business while hiding things from Astral like he was a nosy parent, and the result was utter despair<br><br><br>Yeah, but it's the contrast from everything else prior to that which made it so intense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you are going to lose that soul pretty hard</br>  <br>Even though it was obvious that Shingetsu was Vector, this scene was fucking great</br>  <br> I want to fuck this carding xyz scum </br>  <br> actively referencing DM and GX <br>Where? Beside the statue episode, please tell me the others references.</br></br>  I don't fucking care what anybody say, that ritual trap card is the best thing ever for rituals, so I will get it, but I really hope they ban Trishula, because that is the card based on another broken ass card that never should had that effect exosted.  <br>Only homosexuals would disagree</br>   Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn as an YCS Prize Card <br>FUCKING WHY I HATE YOU TREWART FUCKING LEAVE NOW I HATE THIS WHY I AM STILL PLAYING THIS IF THE GODAMN PROUD OF AMERICASHITTER ARE STILL BEING ASSHOLES</br>  HAHAHA IT MUST FUCKING SUCK TO BE A LIGHTSWORN FAG RIGHT ABOUT NOW  <br>RIP Pegasus. ;_;</br>  <br>Ruri pls, you are attracted to your brother a bit too much.</br>  <br>Or infernoid or clownblade or anything that wants milling you stupid fuck.</br>  <br> you stupid fuck <br>Found the salty mill.dek player</br></br>  <br>Yes I like to sack bitches.</br>  <br> America shit <br>Leave pleb, I bet your country would wish to be like us.</br></br>  <br>Sora please go back to sleep.</br>  <br> Tewart and KoA ever doing anything logical </br>  <br>I don't even fucking play this game IRL anymore and you shouldn't either.

There's no longer no one on the Xyz Dimension.</br>  <br>Ah I love YGOPRO/DNG and shit, get this card for completely free.</br>  <br>It's Heartland anyway, they're clearly pro-incest. Shark and Rio were shameless about it and nobody batted an eyelid.</br>  <br>Shun and Ruri's parents need to stop.</br>  <br>I know, any more Shuns and I'll explode</br>  <br>I wouldnt be surprised if Rio makes incest mandatory when she becomes President</br>  <br>Well look at Shun/Ruri.</br>  <br>muh dick.</br>  <br>You can't force something like that. The purest form of love must occur naturally.</br>  <br>Sorry don't want to be obese</br>  <br>In Zexal they mentioned that Kaito's deck was made using technology from different worlds.</br>  <br>I love this artist.</br>  <br>Yeah I just found this link too and ended up calculating all the ratings just to make sure. I got:<br><br>DM - 7.09 average rating ran from Jan. 2000 - Sept. 2004<br><br>GX - 3.18 average rating from Sept. 2004 - April 2008<br><br>5D's - 2.07 average rating from April 2008 - April 2011<br><br>ZEXAL - 2.25 average rating from April 2011 - October 2012<br><br>The list only goes up to the end of 2012 so there's no consolidated data for 2013-2015 but you can pretty much extrapolate that ratings are going to go down. ARC-V is probably lower than ZEXAL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I am ok trying to win it or buy it.<br><br> Judging us in something about a people instead of country <br>top kek</br></br></br></br>  <br> DM 7.09 <br> Rest have less than 4 <br>Damn</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck with that then, if you don't win it you best be ready to shill out some major money for it if you want it that bad.</br>  So with this movie are they trying to turn Yugi into a Ritual specialist? That new Black Luster Solider support works for generic rituals as well, the BLS effects are just added bonuses.  <br>Well Atem, Yugi, and Kaiba were pretty fucking fabulous.</br>  <br>KOG always wins baby</br>  <br>Kaiba is one of the few characters I can remember who I simultaneously love and hate to death. Can't wait to see what kind of bullshit he pulls in the new movie</br>  <br>It's probably just a Ritual, Yugi will be an Xyz specialist considering Black Luster and Gaia support. <br><br>Since someone brought up Minerva.<br><br> tfw Infinity ends up being a prize card too <br> tfw Head Judge continues being a cunt on the banlist <br> tfw KoA continues to be massive fuck ups </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No amount of Dark Magician Girl porn will ever be enough</br></br>  Post YFW Yuya and Yuzu reunite  IM GONNA BRING IT TO EM<br><br>WATCH ME HIGH FIVE THE SKYS</br></br>  <br> posting non 2d girls.  <br>the fuck are you doing</br></br>  Where is the TCG banlist? It's already three months late.    <br>I want all Konami to reconsider what they are doing before people just bankrupt them. And if you don't believe me see what the "fans" and "professional magazines" did (though in this case was really unfair) to SEGA and Sonic and now soon they will do the same with Nintendo,</br>  <br>Go pop flying</br>  <br>There's that new Sacred BLS as well as the Supreme BLS</br>  <br>Get the fuck off of 4chan and jump into the Stadium, Yuzu.</br>  <br>Sauce</br>  <br>Considering he's the main character and Atem has become a villain and now Pendulums, Synchro, Xyz, and his BEWD, I'm going to imagine A LOT of bullshit. <br><br>Head Judge said for us to stop being impatient and read a book during summer while we wait. They're being cunts about it because they can't actually figure it out.</br></br></br>  <br>It always bothered me that Yuma's Jap voice sounded a lot deeper than you would expect<br><br>His dub voice nails it but his Jap voice makes it seem like Yuma is some 18 year old smoker when he's only 13</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Damn, can't believe 5Ds was received that badly in Nipland. At least DM still reigns supreme.<br><br>Any info on the BBT movie sales?</br></br></br>  Even if vanity is banned, I really think I should move to ARG.  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Do you really enjoy playing against Tellers and Qli?</br>  <br>Blue Eyes is still my favorite ace after all this time. Just has an irreplaceable charm to it that I can't put my finger on.<br> that episode where Kaiba tributed Obelisk to summon Blue Eyes and shit on Ishizu </br></br>  <br>His dub voice only got worse over time though, and it was never great in the beginning either. Shark's voice made him sound like he could be older than Kaito, who was 18.</br>  <br> moving to a meme format <br><br>Well, don't let us stop you.</br></br></br>  <br>At least we got a banlist, and some of them are almost accurate (I could say something against Lavalval and Fusion Gate, but whatever).<br>With Konami what we have?</br></br>  <br> His dub voice only got worse over time though, and it was never great in the beginning either <br>It was his first ever VA role, I wouldnt be surprised if his voice couldnt handle the strain</br></br>  <br>Grossed 250 million in box office and sold about 12k BDs. I guess that's good enough. Hopefully this new movie will have better sales.</br>  <br>There's also the alleged sightings of Silent Magician and Silent Swordsman who looked like their manga art instead of white and blue.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12814532 <br>The TCG meta has been stupid as fuck for a really long fucking time.<br><br>Probably the design, I used to think like this as a kid for Red Eyes too. Too bad I suck at using either deck what with their graveyard discarded, Silver's Cry, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>the guys that print the cards?</br>  <br><br>Or just start hosting your own duels or something on ygopro and omitting the things you don't want. I see people doing duels all the time with shit like "No Xyz, No Synchro." or "No Meta" or "DM Classic Only." and shit.</br></br>  <br> Grossed 250 million in box office and sold about 12k BDs. <br><br>How much you wanna bet that was all because Yami was in the movie?</br></br></br>  <br>It was definitely because of Atem and Judai. The new one is going to sell like hotcakes having Kaiba, Yugi, and Atem all in it.</br>  <br>I'll host a duel on YGOpro<br><br>US Server<br><br>Name: Hundred<br><br>Password: Bennis<br><br>Rules: No  fucking scrubs </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to know what deck you use Hundred, but I'm afraid I'd just get ran over as I haven't played YGO in ages. Just been trying out things on the AI here recently.</br>  <br> LIGHTSWORNS <br>Literally who cares.</br></br>  <br>I use the sackiest deck, Heraldic Beasts</br>  <br>Anyone wanna step up and join? I've got two spectator-kuns in here 2shy2duel</br>  <br>Red-Eyes is so much easier to play with the new support coming through</br>  <br>I used to spurn the OCG meta for being nothing but rank 4 spam engines with mass S/T removal and other nonsense and now I'm begging KoA to do things that even remotely resemble OCG scene.</br>  <br>Yeah I plan to give it a look again, but so far I'm enjoying just messing around with random decks so far. Wish I was good at playing Fluffals though, I'm dogshit at using them.</br>  <br>No, you see anon, when someone does something for a while, they get better at it by simply having that mileage under their belt. Muscles don't break down and stay that way, they rebuild and get stronger. When an artist practices drawing, as an example, they also build muscle memory and finer control of their arm and hand. Your body's ability to recover and adapt is not something that you get to flip on and off like a switch.<br><br>Many Yugioh characters, including MCs, had first-time or rookie VAs who got better over time. I've only seen 4-5 episodes of the Zexal dub (a few at the start and a few around the time Kaito died). But for whatever reason, whether it was 4k's directing or the VA himself, Yuma's voice was actually worse compared to what it was at the beginning, it's amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll play go easy on me senpai</br>  <br> ygopro <br><br>just learn how to play and go on DN.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the same shit man.</br>  Why does Japan keep sexualizing children in anime?  <br>Small things are cute, therefore it only makes sense for even smaller things to be cuter.<br>I'm still sad because a bunch of normalfags voted for the oppai obakes in that image and left 114-chan close to the bottom.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, anon. Even in 2D I can't go full pedo.

I never forget qts.<br><br>I wouldn't be all that surprised if he's relevant in the DC arc,  hopefully he's strong enough to survive </br></br></br>  <br>Whoa, is this HunterxHunter? I thought this show was kids shounen shit.</br>  Didn't take Chimera arc seriously until that part happened   morons still like the objectively shitty weak useless character that's called Ponzu even though she's dead <br>What a surprise. And nothing of value was lost.</br>  <br>are you going to use the same image every time you make these posts?</br>  <br>It is a kid friendly show.</br>  Does Meruem have the soul of Pokkle?  <br>No</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br><br>No Mereum was apparently the shitty leader guy of that gang who produced MDMA.</br></br>  <br>Meruem just like the royal guards doesn't have the soul of anyone in particular.</br>  <br>Stop saying nonsense and read the manga.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1540<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1529:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1539 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

Too bad hot dogs are disgusting.</br>  <br>I have that one. Love her. She's the only of Taito's Sonico prize figures I really like. The rest have been all pretty poor, even for prizes.</br>  <br>You have some nice points for that Guts, that sexy MoMo and the Yusha, but all points were lost by that porkchacoshit</br>  Help guys.<br>I want to get into hotgluing but im having trouble deciding between getting a Pochaco or Cattleya figure.<br>Which one should I get?</br></br>  <br>Just a nendoroid and it's apparently in the city over.</br>  <br>pochaco is cuter</br>   MFC user wants to sell a figure "ASAP everything needs to go!!!" <br> I contact the seller <br> Few days later, no response <br> Listing is still open <br><br>What is wrong with these people?</br></br></br></br></br>  Can we talk about old purchases here or do people mostly talk about new purchases/things they're waiting for?  <br>post about whatever the fuck you want as long as it's not porkchop</br>  <br>Cold feet</br>  <br>The people on that site are infinitely lazy, and hard to deal with.</br>  Holy fuck Ebay is going to make it hard to sell my collection. So many knockoffs being sold for 7 when my item is worth at least 100.  <br>Sell on MFC.</br>  <br>Craigslist? :^)</br>  Anyone know if these 2 are getting the 1/4 with their regular uniform, the angler suit, or both, or what? Can't really tell from the image.  <br>I really don't want to give them money just so I can list. Also having to deal with those people.</br>  <br>Cattleya, but only if you get this figure.</br>  <br>You can list for free. It's much cheaper than eBay, and things most certainly sell faster. The only thing you have to be wary of are the retards that inhabit the site.</br>  <br>Just be patient. As dumb as people who buy on ebay are, there are at least some that have a bit of sense when it comes to avoiding the chinese bootlegs. I've sold tons of figures on there no problem</br>  <br>Last time I listed it was only one item. I have over 170 I'm trying to sell.</br>  <br>Post what you want to sell in a Google sheet and link it here then. Include photos, figure, an imgur link, and price<br>Not that hard.</br></br>  just arrived  Welp prime day was a bust, how sad.  <br>Ah. Well, you can always make a post on their "sales forum" linking your eBay page.</br>  <br>You're trying to sell 170 figures?<br><br>Any of them have big titties?</br></br></br>  <br> http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/friedhuggababy</wbr>  A lot though some DFC to try to even it out.</br>  <br>Either  or just make a blog post about selling all your shit. It's technically against the rules but it should stay up for a couple hours at least before anyone bothers to delete it</br>  <br>oh I know you<br><br>I bought your Violet POP figure a month ago.</br></br></br>  <br>Ha, know anyone who wants my other one?</br>  <br>not unless you needed a 32 inch for $79. And that appleseed bluray.</br>  <br>how much for sepang and green miku?</br>  <br>I'll give you $40 shipped for this.</br>  <br>wow you were trying to sell both? I guess you're trying to ditch your entire collection?<br><br>Anyway I don't know anyone with taste superior enough to enjoy One Piece.</br></br></br>  <br>nobody wants your hotglued shit</br>  <br>The angle of this picture makes it look worse than it should.</br>  <br>I still can't believe you bought the bear, fried.</br>  <br><br><br>Any interested parties email me at <br> friedkun@gmail.com </br></br></br></br>  <br>How much for Muramasa? Fuuri?</br>  <br>Post your MFC page here and sell to us.<br>We can contact you via PM there.</br></br>  <br>I'm about that resale value.<br><br><br>Which Mura?<br><br><br>see<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has anyone hotglued a skirt until it was filled up? This sounds like something I want to see just so I can see what it looks like  <br/>  <br>In that case I got the original release of www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOGDS-13<wbr>7766 a few months back and it's much smaller than I expected. Why do you all think of thw World Uniform Operation line of figures?</wbr></br>  <br>But the bear hasn't sold out on GSC's online shop. In fact, you can still put in a pre-order for it right now.<br><br> I pre-ordered it the day it went up ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>It's about that long game.</br>  <br>WUO is 1/10 scale. I would buy the Heartcatch girls and maybe Futari wa and Fresh if they weren't so small.</br>  Now you can buy Sader's retarded cousin, Daber!<br> http://r.ebay.com/Rry2JB </br>  <br>If that's the case, then I suppose we're in this together.</br>  <br> Saber and Archer <br> There's no Archer </br></br>  <br>Emailed you about <br>Please reply, anon.</br></br>  <br>What's the point of shitting on the characters name if you're still blatantly stealing the franchises copyrighted name and logo?</br>  <br>Because China</br>  <br>When I was a kid there was this imports shop selling batman bootleg toys. At first they were named batman. then some time later "batmen" and finally "batworld".</br>  <br>Yeah I neglected to look at the size so I was surprised to find out how small she was. Still a damn nice figure though.</br>  <br>I really wish there was more high quality figures for the earlier series. I have Eas and she's wonderful.</br>  <br>Holy shit that hotdog.<br>I hope she gets one with an icecream or hotdog between her tits.<br>Lewd dick-like object placement make the best figs.</br></br></br>  <br>same with craigslist most the time. This same dude has been posting the same ad for over a month and he never responds to anything.</br>  <br><br>Sometimes I think these people have a need for attention and list things they really don't want to sell, just to have people message them wanting this thing they have.</br></br>  <br>I wanted the Miki WUO figure but that one is an exclusive and I don't really trust proxy services that much. Are there any other Precure figures you'd recommend that are still easy to find? I only have 2 (well technically 3 but my Chibiarts Peach is missing pieces/went missing awhile back).</br>  <br>I'm holding off ordering anything until after wonfes.</br>  <br>Every time you post, I consider buying something but then I remember that you hotglued half of your stuff.</br>  <br>Source on him hotgluing his figs.</br>  <br>5 that's it.</br>  <br> being this new <br>check the archive</br></br>  <br>He's a guy</br>  <br>I actually wanted it for a second because it was amusing but 20 is still too much.</br>  <br> claim something <br> ask for source <br> tell them to go look for it <br><br>That's not how it works.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd call 'em and see if it's still there. Otherwise hope that Japan Post notices and tosses it back on the plane.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br><br>Did he state that he hotglued his figs or did he post pictures of his figs with hotglue?</br></br>  <br>enjoy your cumstained shit dude, it's not really my problem</br>  <br> that mousepad <br>Pre orders WHEN?</br></br>  <br>These threads.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/userna<wbr>me/fried-kun/order/asc/</wbr></br>  <br>Hopefully amiami puts it up soon.</br>  fried kun has got to be one of the worst posters here. damn near every time he posts it's either about hotglue, scalping, or being rich.  <br>Thanks, so basically stay away from these figures.</br>  <br>His pitiful hotglue you mean<br><br>Honestly, those were the saddest loads I've seen blasted on PVC ever.</br></br></br>  <br>How do I get rich?<br>I have 12k just sitting in my bank.</br></br>  <br>He still hasn't fried that fig he said he was going to.</br>  <br>pls no.</br>  <br>Just stay away from all of them. Knowing how he is, who knows how he has treated his other figures.</br>  New Overlord Thread from <br><br>Preferable with more Narberal</br></br>  Lets not have more retarded useless maids.

I only see a chair.</br></br>  Something I don't think I've seen in these threads, what did you guys think of the preview of Overlord? I personally loved the music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuN<wbr>APPcjDr4</wbr>  [ ]</br>    So with all the talk of power levels last thread and the fact that Gargantua is actually designed to 1v12 players.<br><br>What're the odds one of those raid boss tier new worlders shows up and after Ainz realizes the guardians would lose he has Gargantua go full King Kong vs Godzilla.</br></br>  <br>pretty ballin</br>  <br> liking a useless loli whose only redeeming quality is her body <br><br>This meme is old</br></br></br>  <br> Skeleton <br> Being unable to impersonate the female voice <br> Being unable to log in to two different accounts at the same time <br>The dude has skeleton DNA, he can do anything.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Naberals are dumb and they tend to blow the cover of their leaders. Don't buy a Naberal. Buy a chair instead.  <br>please not bully. She tried her best.</br>  Did anyone notice that Mare worn the ring Ainz gave to him on his left hand ring finger? Is Mare the official waifu?  <br> Narberal is a loli <br>Fuck off secondary<br><br><br> implying Albedo wasn't chosen because she would IMMEDIATELY blow their cover <br> implying Shalltear   The Betrayer isn't the whole reason their cover got blown </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course. He already won the Bone Bowl.</br>  <br>His hole would technically be the tightest, if his creator's tastes are any indication, so he's probably the best waifu.</br>  <br> 128143106 <br>Don't forget they bathe together as well.</br></br>  <br>He's gonna need a big ass ring to teleport his ass out of the Temple.</br>  <br> His hole would technically be the tightest <br>Oh yes. I cannot wait for the doujins</br></br>  <br>I was referring to the hestia pic you fucking mouth breather<br><br>stay fucking buttblasted your waifu is useless and can't follow simple instructions</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder to always bully.<br><br><br>It was actually Naberal mentioning Albedo in front of Enfrea that ended up blowing their cover.<br> Trying to blame a chair. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was casually brought to an outside lake in volume 4.<br><br><br>Ainz would probably throw the smallest amount of people he could at threats because he is so suspicious, so I doubt it</br></br></br></br>  <br> Don't buy a Naberal. Buy a chair instead. <br>Or you can use a Narberal as a chair seeing as she's useless at everything else, although knowing her she'd find a way to fuck that up too.</br></br>  <br>You were only referring to your own inability to use the english language faggot<br><br><br>Enfrea and Lizzie are a nonproblem because they are now part of Ainz Ooal Gown. The Black Sacrament AND Brain, on the other hand...</br></br></br></br>  <br> mad because I told him exactly how shit and useless his waifu is so he says something that doesn't make sense <br><br>Narberal a useless shit<br><br>A SHIT</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Black Sacrament doesn't know Chair was working under Momon, so that's a non-issue. Neither does Brian. In this case, the leak that Momon was also a magic caster has more detrimental effects, since everybody only him as a warrior.</br>  <br>Well, technically as a doppleganger, she can actually BECOME a chair better than makeshift chairs in Nazarick.<br> Demiurge's custom, handmade chair is probably best though. <br><br> Still not actually sure if he was a little disappointed that Ainz didn't use his painstakingly made bone throne, or was too excited by Shalltear being a novel chair to care. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Referring to the Hestia imitation part of the pic as "Narberal" <br> Waifu is canonically one of the only NPCs who does not fuck up in any sense of Ainz's perceptions <br>Fuck off secondary but have a Narberal before you go</br></br></br>  <br> that stereotypical cute bunny X-mouth that Japan likes <br>Narberal needs more excuses to be a bunny forever.</br></br>  <br>she has bunny ears at least.</br>  <br>You're a fucking worthless nigger<br><br>You posted using a picture of Hestia so I called you on your shit taste for liking a useless character whose only redeeming quality is her body (Hestia)<br><br>Narberalfags are as fucking stupid as their waifu</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> little disappointed <br>It hurt him. Deep down, something broke.</br></br>  <br>The Black Sacrament is in the process of reviving the ones she killed, who will easily recognize her and connect the dots rather fast. Brain also matters because he could easily spill the beans.<br><br>In any case, Enfrea nor Lizzie have ever communicated with anyone that the Black Warrior Momon is also a Magic Caster. So no, that is the non-issue.</br></br></br>  Papa Bones probably don't even care about any of the girls, well I might be wrong, I didn't read the novels.  NARBERAL IS CUTE CUTE CUTE!!!  <br>That wasn't a picture of hestia faggot, take a look at it again</br>  <br> It hurt him. Deep down, something broke. <br>You making that up or did I miss a line?<br><br>I swear, I'm dropping details left and right because the author has a habit of giving a tad too much exposition sometimes (granted, it's necessary and I'm just a lazy shit).</br></br></br></br>  <br>Made up. Don't get too paranoid.</br>  <br>Here have a bunny Narberal</br>  <br>WTF are you talking about fucking fag? That's clearly hestia.<br><br>fucking hell narberetards can't even recognize their own fagfu.</br></br></br>  The lewd talk about the human mooks in the drama CD regarding Ainz/Momon-the-Adventurer and "Nabel" is something out of left field for me. It opens up Ainz/Narberal near-canonically, at least regarding MISUNDERSTANDINGS that form the basis of anime/mango romance.<br> It'd be hilarious if Momon declares Narberal "his fiance" to get the humans he meets to stop trying to seduce/entice him, and Nazarick goes absolutely apeshit over his callous white lie. </br>  <br>Her cosplaying as someone even more useless than her is worse<br><br>How fucking shit is your taste to like legitimately useless girls?<br><br> Hestia <br> goddess <br> fucking poor and useless <br><br> narberal <br> blows her master's cover by not being able to follow an extremely simple instructiong </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's clearly hestia. <br><br>Tell me you are baiting</br></br></br>  <br> Don't get too paranoid. <br>Demiurge just does that to me. I think that's the point of his character. I know he's loyal as can be, but it just makes me wonder what he's actually thinking (or if he's really as straight-laced as he acts internally as well).</br></br>  <br> The Black Sacrament is in the process of reviving the ones she killed, who will easily recognize her and connect the dots rather fast. <br>Connect what dots exactly? The only thing the Black Sacrament knows is that a renegade vampire killed 3 of their members and was defeated by an adventurer by the name of Momon. Same with Brain, there's nothing connecting Shalltear with anything.</br></br>  <br>Don't take his bait<br><br><br>Narberal did nothing wrong<br><br>Here have some embarrassed Meido to cleanse your filthy human (insect) mouth</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the namefag from the other thread aren't you?<br><br>How many threads do you need to be btfod in by acting like Narberal is some top tier character before you learn?</br></br></br>  <br> did nothing wrong <br><br>Narberalfags are fucking retarded and delusional<br><br>Call me when she can follow instructions</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this animal-girl meido design better than the one we have now in the anime.<br>It's nice, but it's not cute enough.</br></br>  <br><br>Hey kid wanna /Touch Me/?</br></br>  <br> Accuses me of being a namefag <br> Not even responding anymore <br>D A M A G E C O N T R O L<br>A<br>M<br>A<br>G<br>E<br><br>C<br>O<br>N<br>T<br>R<br>O<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that the only Pleiades that wouldn't kill your disgusting ass on sight is Yuri Alpha.  <br><br>And Shizu.</br></br>  <br> damage control <br> implying I'm the same anon <br><br>You realize there's more than one person replying to you correct?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a joke, to be honest.<br><br>I really tried to make it as obvious as possible, sorry.</br></br></br>  <br>It's ok, I'm ugly enough to pass for demi-human.  ;_; </br>  <br>Yes but there's only one baiting like you are anon</br>  I want to like these characters but I know that if I were to ever (for some unearthly reason) meet them, they would immediately kill me or enslave me or tell me to fuck off for being so weak.  <br>My bad, you triggered my autism really hard there.</br>  <br>Isn't Aura also Neutral?<br><br>Also Entoma won't kill humans unless he is hungry</br></br></br>  <br>Did it ever go into detail about how op touch me was? I know they said he was completely broken, they disabled the ability to obtain his build etc, but I don't recall it ever saying how ridiculous exactly he was. I'm sure when the admins actually blacklist your build though something went terribly wrong. Scary that PA can imitate him too.</br>  <br><br>Reminder that there is no waifu on 4chan who would accept any anon</br></br>  <br>Makes you wonder why he took Narberal along instead of someone more reasonable  and someone who can follow simple instructions. </br>    <br>Still missing Cocytus.</br>  <br>You need to put more trust in the power of love.</br>  <br> implying I'm baiting <br><br>Damage control b o y s<br><br>I bet if you married Narberal she couldn't even make dinner from a recipe online without melting the pot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the guy is practically naked, so I don't know how he would do it.</br>  <br>He literally thought to himself "fuck I should've brought Yuri instead" when Narb kept shitting the bed.</br>  <br>Wrong.</br>  <br>All I know is that he won the pvp world champion against other world champions, which was a broken class and is awarded with an divine item.</br>  <br>He gambled on her not being an idiot and lost.</br>  <br> I bet if you married Narberal she couldn't even make dinner from a recipe online without melting the pot <br>Sorry, this isn't an RP thread anon</br></br>  <br>So is Victim.</br>  <br>He won it easily.</br>  <br>This is true.

And that was a week before chapter 1.</br>  <br>Ainz isn't completely naked, he's got that coat thing.</br>  <br>I'm Sene9ty too.</br>  <br><br>Well then, I hope the guys in charge of releasing aren't fags enough to not release the whole volume.</br></br>  <br>I guess vol 6 is confirmed fished too.</br>  <br>Volume 10 is finished too.</br>  <br>why would they do that? If they released the whole thing they would have to start on the next one. I think Kaezar has 6 though.</br>  <br>...Everyone has skeleton DNA, except for ice bug, slimes, and such.<br><br>How insane would Albedo become if Ainz decided to date best girl Narberal?</br></br></br>  I heard everything up to vol 10 is finished  Seems we won't get [ayy] Overlord - 02 [720p][M3M3SUBS].mkv before this weekend.<br>CoffeeFlux pls.</br>  <br>Pls go, Maruyama</br>  <br>I thought his class was just a specific prestige build he happened to follow then won the tournament which gave him the beyond broken divine class armor which just exacerbated his already op build . (wasn't it basically world anyway?) If the class world champion was already so broken he wouldn't have easily beat others in the tournament.</br>  <br>For how much i'd love to see Narberal in the competition, i know that it's just impossible.</br>  <br>what's wrong with the one out now?</br>  <br><br>Why wouldn't they?

He got a ton of money from donations too.</br>  <br>It's not even Thursday yet for BS11 broadcast.</br>  <br>Don't give up hope anon, there are times when authors make the right choice and listen to the fans to determine which girl should win (the popular one).</br>  <br>I mean the horriblesub one looked fine.

Yes, if they get her right.</br>  <br>well, fyi, the TLs for this serires have been going on a looong time. The usual schedual was a part or maybe a chapter a week, if we're lucky.

From a technical standpoint, she gets a lot more attention both camera-wise and from Ainz because of it.<br> she got intimate contact with Ainz's waist <br> Albedo can't say any such thing (until she snaps and tries to take it by force, the ungrateful wench) <br> etc. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember that.

How the fuck Luffy and the others were able to rest, when Fujitora is supposed to be on their asses?  <br>Issho quit the marines in the previous chapter</br>  <br><br>He didn't quit. Akainu just basically told him that he had to sleep on the couch until he killed Law and Luffy.</br></br>  <br>W-wha?!<br><br>I thought he would capture Luffy and Law to fight Sakazuki.</br></br></br>  <br>He's more likely to join Laws crew since his jolly roger can easily change into Law's.</br>  <br><br>Kek</br></br>  <br><br>It will be kinda weird with that line crossing the entire smiley. Won't be something Law would like to see everyday.</br></br>  <br>That's what happens when you read terrible translations. Why would he capture them after gambling on them?</br>  <br>You can also tell by his facial expressions that he wants nothing to do with the Marines</br>  <br><br>Kinda weird seeing a recently introduced admiral quitting. Will there be a replacement?</br></br>  <br> Smoker </br>  <br>He didn't. It was Sakazuki's promise that they would fight if Issho get them.</br>  <br><br>As much as I would like that, he is not strong enough.</br></br>   "hurr who is my favorite and why is meme phrase to start thread durr"   <br>He didn't quit I think the real world comparison would be suspended without pay</br>  <br>Please re type that post in English</br>  <br><br>It really works great for him. He gets all of the clout and prestige of being an admiral, without any work or responsibilities. Sakazuki cannot and will not forgive him, so Issho can do whatever he wants and have a freedom that other admirals don't get. Hell, he can even retire to some island and live his life out there, never being bothered.</br></br>  <br>Nakamas were a mistake</br>  <br>Fujitora did not promised anything, he only agreed to Akainu's face off offer, and was asked for the heads of Luffy and Law in exchange.<br><br>For fucks sake read the chapter again.</br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>Don't tell me what to do punk</br>  <br>Okay<br><br>Please appreciate Penguin, if you feel so inclined and are in a good mood, thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>not shachi though cause hes a fag</br>  Who was birds?  Were spoilers posted yet today? I just got back home.  <br><br>The chapter is already out</br></br>  Bellamy will join Law's crew.<br><br><br>Chapter came out 14 hours ago anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Weren't you banned already?<br><br><br>Crow zoan fruit user, new character.</br></br></br></br>  Which ship's design is your favorite?

I just discovered that it was out ten minutes ago.</br></br></br>  <br><br>In English, dork.</br></br>  This chapter felt really out of place.

Stop using words you don't understand.<br> For instance why didn't Luffy use that the first time Law and him reached Doffy and Law was still 100% operational. <br>Because you have to weaken your opponent first. You saw yourself how much Doffy could tank G4 attacks, even to the point where Luffy had to run and hide for 10 minutes in the fight. Luffy and everyone else never uses their strongest moves t the beginning of a fight; you should know that by now.</br></br></br>    <br>Please go homo</br>  <br>Sanji is better with his hands than Zoro is<br><br>The only reason Zoro seems stronger is because Sanji's focus is cooking, not being the world's strongest.
