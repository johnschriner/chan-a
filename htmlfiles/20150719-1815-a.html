[ manga with the best art?  <br>I'm reviving this post from being archived, folks.</br>  Gundam Seed was a sort of remake of Mobile Suit Gundam.<br>Gundam 00 was a sort of remake of Gundam Wing.<br>G no Reconguista was a sort of remake of Turn A Gundam.<br>Build Fighters was a sort of remake of G Gundam.<br><br>Logically, G-Tekketsu or Gundam Iron-Blood Orphans will be inspired by Gundam Seed or X, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm leaning strongly towards X  I hope so. SEED was great.  <br>Gundam SEED was a sort of reboot of the OG series yes, the rest you've listed are not though.<br><br>SEED Destiny was supposed to be a reboot of Zeta Gundam, but after that they stopped doing these reboot things, so this post is pointless.</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully X. I love X so much.</br>  <br> one of the best shows gets rebooted into the worst show </br>  <br> Gundam 00 was a sort of remake of Gundam Wing. <br>Not even close.</br></br>  <br>Reboot's are usually never good, what do you expect?<br><br>And Zeta was shit anyway, so whatever.</br></br></br>  <br> zeta was shit <br>Citation needed</br></br>  <br>X had new-type dolphins, what will this have?<br>New-type honey badgers, I hope.</br></br>  <br>What exactly was good about Zeta?<br><br>It was pretty much just some angry kid doing what the military wanted him to do while whining all the way through, and developing a harem of people who died really pathetic deaths in the end anyway.<br><br>The entire "Four arc" was stupid as well, he meets some random chick and suddenly decides that she's some miracle girl for him, and then while she's going on a rampage she suddenly comes to her senses because of the usual Mary SueType crap.</br></br></br></br></br>  X seems most likely.<br><br> What was AGE a remake of? </br></br>  <br>   What was AGE a remake of? <br>Turn-A.<br>Well you know the whole "lost technology" and angry space cult that being forgotten by earthlings.</br></br></br>  <br> because of the usual Mary SueType crap. <br>Honestly, I dislike the NT concept after MSG for a large part anyway.</br></br>  <br>AGE was a remake of OG, Zeta and ZZ, are you stupid?</br>  <br>I have no problem with the idea of Newtypes. They add a bit of flavor to the setting.<br><br>I just hate it when they use Newtype powers to resolve plot points, like in Unicorn.</br></br></br>  <br>Newtypes really got out of hand when they began to able to do ANYTHING. Don't even get me started on Unicorn's time travel oh my god.</br>  <br> I just hate it when they use Newtype powers to resolve plot points, like in Unicorn. <br>Which is why I find it getting sillier and sillier in Zeta and onward. I was fine with remote use, limited precognition, and the like, but then it just starts getting silly. It's almost like they were playing "top this" with Wacky Newtype Tricks.</br></br>  the PV reminded me of X<br><br>i liked X</br></br>  <br> Gundam 00 was a sort of remake of Gundam Wing <br>The main charaters are teenage boys that pilot Gundams. That's pretty much the only similarity. 00 season 2 is more like Zeta.</br></br>  <br>A crossover between Inazuma Eleven and 0079, Z and ZZ Gundam.</br>  <br> Gundam 00 was a sort of remake of Gundam Wing </br>  Are there any Gundam series where the four cour length is justified? I've been going through Universal Century and it's alright so far but pretty much all the TV series are way longer than they need to be and end up having lots of filler and episode where nothing happens.  <br> SEED was worse than MSG <br> G Reco was worse than Turn A <br> BF was okay, but BFT is definitely worse than G <br>00 was the only one that was an overall improvement, but even that was just half good, and went retarded later on.<br><br>I have low hopes, following your logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gundam 00</br>  <br> I hope so. SEED was great. <br>Quite possibly the worst thing I've ever watched.</br></br>  <br>Just die already. Nobody liked 00 except model builders.</br>  <br> posts in a Gundam thread <br> doesn't build models <br><br>Holy fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>Season 1 was fucking solid, mate. Besides He wasn't asking what was good.</br>  <br>I liked Season 1 pretty well. For one, it did a really good job of making the various Earth faction characters much more likable than the protagonists. <br><br>S2 kinda forgot about all that and went too heavily on the UCisms to please those fans who were probably feeling neglected.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't hate myself enough to build models from shit series.</br>  <br>Why are you contributing to a thread of a shit series?<br><br>Do you like talking about shit?</br></br></br>  For such a long franchise there doesn't actually seem to be a Gundam show that's universally praised, maybe it's just Tomino's awkward writing.  <br>I'd say most everyone likes 0079/</br>  <br>Everyone loves 0080.</br>  <br>Yeah, but how much of that is because of the movies?</br>  <br>Is 00 the only series in this thread? You might want to stop with the inferences where there's no evidence, it just makes you sound like a child.</br>  <br>I don't know, I haven't actually seen em. I can't find a download for them anywhere.</br>  <br>This. The Gundam OVA series are so much better than the tv series.</br>  <br>Only 0080, the rest are shit</br>  <br>Definitely not G Gundam<br><br>G could've been one cour</br></br></br>  <br> G no Reconguista was a sort of remake of Turn A Gundam. <br>wat</br></br>  <br><br>If anything, 00 was too short. Trailblazer was the fast-forward seizure version of what should've been a two-cour story.</br></br>  <br>Really, there's not that much to work with. You have a couple that are tied to series, 0083 which is pretty but dumb, and Unicorn which is pretty but a general UC Gundam fill-in-the-blanks Zeon/NT wankfest.<br><br>0080 is best almost by default.</br></br></br>  <br>looks like X and 08th</br>  <br>0080 and Unicorn are really the only good ones, everything else is just crap because it's too short.</br>  <br><br>I thought 08th MS Team was half-decent.</br></br>  <br><br>08MS team and Endless Waltz are good.</br></br>  <br>NT go full lol magic is the worst thing they do for UC.<br>Early NT like telepath and predict is good but when you turn it to super saiyan magic it fucking bullshit.</br></br>  I hoped that Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans being 50 episodes. <br><br>A Gundam show that being less than 49/50 episodes count or split cour is a big fucking no.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the ending of Zeta annoyed me with all that aura super power shit. It was a pretty good series apart from that.</br>  <br>God I fucking hope not.<br><br>Gundam seed is the unequivocally worst mecha show in existence. I get nightmares about the re-used animations and 38 consecutive MY SISTER IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAD flashbacks.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? Most of the 50 episode Gundam shows are badly paced.</br>  <br>CCA and Unicorn's NT wankery is the absolute worst, good thing they tuned that shit down in late UC but nobody watched those things anyways.</br>  <br><br>So in that picture I've found Itaru from S;G, Amata from Aquarion Evol, and Scar from FMA.</br></br>  <br>Split cour would be fine in my book. <br><br>Needless to say a full year run would be the ideal but that just doesn't happen in this day and age anymore (unless it's precure). I just don't want another G-reco where it really needed the extra episodes</br></br></br>  I am of the opinion that the OG X Gundam is the best Gundam ever designed. I want to fuck it, it's so sexy.  <br>It's going to be a remake of 08th MS Team hopefully.</br>  <br>I don't know about your Build Fighter analogy, but I liked both BF and G. The only similarities were that they both revolved around tournaments. I liked BF for being very tongue in cheek and G for being very high-energy super-robot.<br><br>Try was disappointing. It truly tried too hard.</br></br></br>  <br>I respectfully disagree.<br><br>Gamma Gundam a best.</br></br></br>  <br>G-Reco desperately needed more episodes than it had, especially at the ending were it just rushed through everything.</br>  <br>That's what happens when you crank out an entire anime original series in under six months.</br>  <br>The stark tone change because of the director switch in the latter half was a big fault in 08th MS Team.</br>  I want to hug sleepy one-eyed sniper Hibiki.  <br>Even edgy Aoi is a miracle!</br>  <br> Symphogear GX <br> Rokko's Modern Life no Yuusha <br>I don't know VAs.</br></br></br>  <br>Look at this fucking otaku!<br><br>Where's your buddy Silvermask, huh?</br></br></br>  In which we argue about how useless Hibiki is for another 500 posts.  Best doll  <br>Nobody you can sleep with like that is ever useless.</br>  <br>yellow &gt; blue &gt; green<br>Red is still too unknown for me to make the call.</br></br>  <br>At this point I would rather have that bullshit about Kanade-noise fanfictions and whatever,</br>   Tsubasa moping around because her sword is gone <br> Maria gets to play older sister <br> "You spend so much time being tough for your juniors, but you should let yourself be spoiled by your senior sometimes." </br></br>  <br>Can we argue about how useful Maria will be instead?</br>  Riddle me this. <br><br>If Kanade had lived while Hibiki had shards of Gungnir within her, would Kanade still have been able to user her relic even though it was shattered technically?</br></br>      <br>I... guess? I mean Maria's Gungnir worked fine at the same time and that was also just a shard from the original spear.</br>  <br>DESS DESS DESS</br>  <br>I hope Tsubasa and Maria go on a cute deito now that neither of them has anything to do.</br>  <br>Dess Henshin sounds like a band name.</br>  <br> will be <br>What do you mean will be? She already fought a doll without a gear, she moved Tsubasa away from civilians and saved them due to quick thinking, she didn't get anyone hurt and she took responsibility for all her actions while looking to the future and making plans for how to fix things. Maria is fucking on point.</br></br>  <br>best way to think is to state that gungnir shattering during swan song is what killed Kanade. so we dont have to speculate.</br>  <br>What exactly will Maria be doing to spoil Tsubasa?</br>  <br>Please translate it, friends.</br>  I want to Anime-chan's beef stroganoff.  <br>Going by OP, Red has an insane amount of bloodlust</br>  <br>So we could have an army of Ichiaval users running around if we chose to ignore morality?<br><br>That'd be pretty sweet. <br><br><br>But speculation is the fun part. What-if, what could have been. All that good stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SU TO RA GO NO FU</br>  <br>That or drunken adventures will suffice</br>  <br>Walk right up to her and whisper in her ear:<br> "Rorschach dies." </br></br>  <br>There's 3 entire doujins that need it.</br>  Thinking about it, I wonder what are the 3 girls with broken relics going to be doing while waiting for whatever plot related event fixes their gears.<br><br>I guess Maria can spend time with the kids since they're injured. Tsubasa can go train while pretending she's a sword and Chris watches more movies if she's not at school. Maybe spend time with Elfnein too.</br></br>  <br><br>That song was really good.</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa and Maria can take Elf9 clothes shopping while everyone else is at school.</br>  I just noticed that Elfnein actually says "Zababa" here.<br><br>Maybe this is hinting towards how DMJii will be able to use their gears without linker (something apart from Dwern Dain's legacy upgrade).<br><br>I always wondered why they say "tron" in their chant while the other linker junkies use "zilzz"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Figured she was just correctly identifying their gears, like she did Chris's.</br>  <br>More like 4 since Kohakura released one of their old doujins on pixiv</br>  <br><br>That song may have been the best thing that has happened in all three seasons of this show.</br></br>  <br>Of course it doesn't actually make sense for her to have that knowledge  unless Carol intended for her to meet them all along. </br>  <br>But that's Chris's job. Tsubasa and Maria can go spar and get Maria her ninja training.</br>  If animechan dies episode 7 I think im done with symphogear.  <br>I want Tsubasa to take Elf9 for a stroll taking her to places while riding her motorcycle.<br>And I also hope it doesn't blow up.</br></br>  <br>Her odds of making it through episode 4 aren't looking great.</br>  <br>Oh, the comment at the end was for Chris. Maria spends time with the kids, Tsubasa can train (and bring Maria along to train with now that you mention it). Chris just watching movies seemed boring so she gets the buddy time with Elf.</br>  Atelier Carol when  <br>Meant it for </br>  <br>Who are the other two Atelier's though? It always comes in a trilogy IE Meruru/Totori/Carona Lite.</br>  <br>What if Elfnein is the final boss and she's just befriending the gears as part of her plan?</br>  <br>I'll say Maria is useful when the seasons over and she hasn't spent most of the run time cry or being wishy washy.</br>  <br>It was. And this is a show with some pretty fucking amazing moments, so that says something.</br>  I'm way too fucking drunk for this thread  Quote soon  as she's dying.   <br>Gee, two and a half seasons in, you sure showed them!<br><br>Why would it even be in episode 7 anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry sport. I don't translate H-doujin for most series.</br>  <br>Nana said at a concert that she does a lot of screaming in episode 7.<br>Kaneko said that people think he crossed a line in episode 7.</br></br>  <br>I want to cover Bikki in my baking flour.</br>  <br>Translate the individual page then, give us a taste. Or I will taste you.</br>  <br>7 is always a mysterious number for Symphogear.</br>  <br>they will go to F.I.S headquarters</br>  <br> H <br>Two are harmless SFW hijinks; and the other just has Tsubasa playing with Maria's ladyparts with no nudity.</br></br>     everyone jumping ship to Tsubasa/Maria and leaving Tsubasa/Chris behind <br><br>why does it hurt so much</br></br>  <br>Ok, just for you.<br> Hai <br> A <br><br> Arigato <br> N, denwa <br><br> Moshi moshi <br> Oogawasan? Ima? Etto... <br><br> Sou, soko no chikaku <br> Ee, ee, ryoukai yo <br><br>You can do the rest. I believe in you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still believe.<br>But for now, Nana wants us to have fun with TsubaMari.</br></br>  <br> Two are harmless SFW hijinks <br>Yeah, but is it funny like that pixiv comic where Chris is being a cool senpai?<br><br><br> Chris is my waifu <br> Everyone is shipped <br> My waifu has a dad, a bunch of kouhais and is one of the best gear users <br>Life is good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone jumping to Tsubasa/Chris and leaving Tsubasa/Kanade behind <br><br>why does it hurt so much</br></br></br>  <br> tfw everyone ships Tsubasa to secondary bitches <br> everyone forgot about Kanade <br>Kanade will always and forever be Tsubasa's waifu.</br></br></br>  <br>What Nana wants, Nana gets. Gotta collect all the titty monsters.</br>  <br><br>well for starters Kanade is DEAD<br><br>second of all that was more sisterly, especially considering Kanade's little sister apparently resembled Tsubasa</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because it feels forced, but a lot of it is because, up until the second half of this episode, they were both on an entirely different continent.</br>  <br>It's funny because she did it in Cross Ange too.</br>  <br> that KanaDAD hair <br>No homo of course.</br></br>  <br>I really fucking wish someone would scan the design archive.</br>  <br><br>so Chris/Tsubasa/Maria poly trio?<br><br>I can get behind that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its funnier because Nana's actually kind of flat in real life.</br>  <br>Why should being dead matter? Does the 2D/3D barrier stop you loving your waifu?</br>  <br>Ah, so Tsubasa is literally a self-insert? That's a funny thought.</br>  <br>Maria/Hibiki/Kanade poly trio. C'mon man, three girls all up on that massive spear.</br>  <br>Whose hands are these?</br>  <br>The only thing Tsubasa and Nana don't have in common is their height.</br>  <br>Tsubasa is Nana's self-insert from the very start.</br>  <br>Didn't the drawing make that obvious?</br>  <br><br>I don't really go for the waifu thing, anon</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa's still a fucking shrimp compared to me. I could knock her over.</br>  <br>Well, I can't imagine Nana being tall anyway.</br>  <br> 777 <br>Since when did you learn to post in 4chan, Nana?</br></br>  <br> 5' 0" (1.53 m) <br>Jesus, she manages to be smaller than my eldest sister.</br></br>  <br>Kanade and Tsubasa. <br><br><br>Ah, well that rhetoric backfired. Didn't know my crowd well enough it seems.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Look, I just want Tsubasa to be happy and loved.<br><br>Hard to do that in canon with a dead wife</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder of what happens in Episode 7 for the last two seasons?</br>  <br>And yet from that small body she can produce a very powerful voice and she has more guts than a woman that is 6 feet tall.</br>  <br><br> That sly peek at 0:17 </br></br>  <br>If your waifu dies in canon, she dies in real life.</br>  <br>Just think that once Tsubasa dies she'll finally be able to reunite with her waifu in Heaven.</br>  <br>I see your point but do you think she'd be happy with Maria or Chris?<br><br>Maria is just a poor replacement for Kanade and Chris is just her lovable junior. <br><br><br>Bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>s1: Zenbu zenbu zenbu<br>s2: Hibiki finds out she has cancer</br></br>  <br>I could still probably pick her up and chuck her into a lake. Don't fuck with me, Nana Mizuki.</br>  <br> Don't fuck with me, Nana Mizuki. <br>I can pick you up and chuck you in front of a Japanese death truck. Don't fuck with Nana-chan.</br></br>  <br><br>chris challenges and snarks at her. every day would be an adventure.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, I'm sure Nana doesn't want to fuck you anyway even if you force her to.</br>  <br>S1 was Miku Pls<br>S2 was Relic Cancer</br></br>  I still can't handle the previews only being a few hours away from the next episode.  <br><br> needing to use a truck <br> implying he wouldn't be literally torn to pieces by rabid fans </br></br></br>  <br>It would get old fast. Chris wouldn't be able to grow as a person if she has Tsubasa to rely on.</br>  <br>You can pick her up, she's small and light anyway.<br>Your only problem is the million of faggots that will feast over your dead body the moment you forcefully touch her.</br></br>  <br> So we could have an army of Ichiaval users running around if we chose to ignore morality? <br><br>No, because you need a converter to turn a relic into a Symphogear. Hence why Chris, Tsubasa and Maria are down and out despite still having their relic fragments.<br><br>I'm guessing Hibiki didn't need one because the Gungnir itself responded to her, which is also why she could override Maria's transformation.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Yeah? See how they like my FLAMETHROWER.</br></br>  Suddenly, best girl  <br><br> Throwing swords into lakes <br><br>Who are you, Sir Griflet?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Chris now has to have her time being the older reliable one; while Tsubasa has to get back in touch with the half of her personality she locked away years ago.</br>  <br>You'll run out of gas long before she runs out of fans.</br>  <br>Chris is so tiny</br>  <br>I can imagine it.<br> anon goes to Nana's concert to pick her up, run away and throw her to the lake <br> anon tries to go up the stage the moment Nana turns her back away <br> anon tries to touch Nana <br> gets shot point-blank by a Nanafag sniper <br> Nanafags quickly get on the stage and clear the mess <br> show somehow continues even though Nana is confused </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kiri-chan is lewd this season.</br>  <br> implying it's not my Symphogear <br><br>Where do you think we are?</br></br></br>  <br>What, you think she only has 100 fans?</br>  <br> Nanafag sniper <br> Snipers with a bunch of Nana merch and other shit slapped on them <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br> gets shot point blank <br> by a sniper <br><br>Uh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nana's Symphogear will fuck up your shit hard, m8.</br>  <br>It's your single Symphogear vs all her fan's Symphogear. <br><br>Where do you think you are?</br></br></br>  <br>Nana does seem rather tall around the likes of Aoi though. Isn’t she pretty much the tallest of the whole cast?</br>  <br>She's way shorter than me so I have the advantage.</br>  <br>Did you forget Sugita and the others are part of the cast too or something?</br>  <br>That's not saying much</br>  <br>Being taller than Aoi is not an accomplishment.</br>  <br>Chris is for kouhai anon.<br><br> I've always shipped TsubaMaria though.  </br></br></br>  <br> implying she's not small and fast enough to fuck up your asshole before you can even start reciting "FUCK YOU YOU LITTLE BITCH CUNT" </br>  <br>Sugita doesn’t count, he’s male. Japanese men are small too, but not THAT small.</br>  <br>I already summoned a bunch of Arcanoise before this, they're done for.<br><br>Also I'm going to throw Aoi Yuuki in the lake as well. I can carry one of them in each hand.</br></br></br>  Ver soon? They wouldn't have shown him together with Ryoko and then say that they need Ryoko's expertise right?  <br> Nana's /k/ fanbase <br> they sing Nana's latest songs while shooting people pretending like they're Symphogear users </br></br>  <br>He’ll finally get to be a hero. He won’t be the last one, but everyone starts small.</br>  <br>How long until we get a doujin like the one that triggers crack-kun super hard but with Chris, Kirika, and Shirabe instead?</br>  <br>Fuck you.<br>I hope Nana burns your soul before you can even find Aoi.</br></br>  <br> Also I'm going to throw Aoi Yuuki in the lake as well. I can carry one of them in each hand. <br><br>You're literally just adding more hassle to your day. <br>You've now got to deal with Aoi's fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  <br> /ak/ singing Glorious Break and Beyond the Blade while shooting their nuggets </br>  <br>It's all worth it to throw these two into a lake.</br>  <br> is it funny like that pixiv comic where Chris is being a cool senpai? <br><br>When would drunk Maria not be funny?</br></br></br>  Ikuzim Anan<br>Ikuzim Anan<br>Ikuzim Anan<br><br>Behold she comes. Your soul is forfeit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn anon you must really want to see those wet T-shirts.</br>  <br> summoning the Aoifags and triggering the Nanafags  <br>Its like you want to be burned on the stake like Carol's father.</br></br>  <br> He’ll finally get to be a hero <br>I hope he's still crazy but tones down the evil.</br></br>  <br>I think you meant <br> Suddenly, carrying best girl. <br><br><br>You can go fuck yourself. I'm going to Symphogear live and I'm going to scoop up Nana, Aoi and Ayahi and run faster than any of her fans. I've already been to Japan and they're all very small and meek people.<br><br>Once I'm out of sight I'll take them back to my hotel where I cook curry for them and ask if it's to there liking, then ask Nana if she can teach me her recipe. Aoi will also get many head pats and ice cream cones.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you really want to see them that wet so much?</br>  <br> Aoi in a wet t-shirt </br>  <br>You won't make it. You're outnumbered with no allies. <br>You've doomed yourself to failure. No chance of victory.</br></br>  <br>Then post that shit.</br>  <br>And so my grand plan is finally revealed.</br>  <br>Now I know why anon wants to throw them in the lake so much.<br>I want to see Nana wet as fuck too, anon.</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/828586/fdef39<wbr>4f64/</wbr></br>  ˢʷᵉᵃʳ ᵗᵒ ᵍᵒᵈ ᶦᶠ ᵃᶰʸ ᵒᶠ ʸᵒᵘ ᵐᵒᵗʰᵉʳʳᶠᵘᶜᵏᵉʳˢ ᶜᵒᵖʸ ᵃᶰᵈ ᵖᵃˢᵗᵉ ᵗʰᶦˢ ʸᵒᵘ ʷᶦᶫᶫ ᵇᵉ ᶦᶰ ˢᵉʳᶦᵒᵘˢ ᵗʳᵒᵘᵇᶫᵉ.  <br> 7777 <br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Joke's on you, I'm actually Genjuro.</br>  <br>NANA WANTED TO REVEAL HER WET T-SHIRT ALL ALONG. <br><br>DAMN IT, NANA. YOU PLAYED US FOR FOOLS WITH REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, and what are you gonna do fuccboi?</br>  <br>Shit, why don't you give them a bowl of eggs while you're at it, you freak?</br>   this thread <br>What the fuck.</br>  <br>Well shit. I'm no longer liking these odds.</br>  <br> 7777 <br>Looks like Nana was testing our loyalty again.</br></br>  <br>Would you prefer the last thread?</br>  <br>I'll do you one better.<br> Suddenly, best girl carrying best girl <br><br>It is Symphogear, after all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BUT WITHOUT YOU THE BRIDGE WILL BE PARALYZED!</br>  <br> hotel <br>You fucker, you'll trigger Nana's PTSD.</br></br>  <br>And that's why the concert is being held on the submarine. In the middle of a lake.</br>  <br>That brings out such a major flaw in the SONG system. <br>If you remove Genjuro, they fall to pieces. They need to get Bridge Guy and Bridge Girl to step up to be able to take care of business if Genjuro gets indisposed of like going to the toilet or napping.</br></br>  <br>I don't see why it's a problem now when he did it quite a few times back in season 1.</br>  Anyone got a link to a webm with sound of the Beef Stroganoff scene?  <br>I am looking for this too. If one doesn't show up soon I might just figure out how to make my own.</br>  <br>Don't be ridiculous, anon. If I use eggs they're going to be raw eggs used as dipping sauce for shabu shabu.</br>  <br>Well he is in a submarine under water most of the time. I can see why him leaving would be a hassle. <br>Still doesn't excuse the piss poor command chain however.</br></br>  <br>Ah fuck, my mistake. <br><br>I guess I could rent out part of an inn.</br></br></br>  <br>He better give it cooked, Nana hates raw food.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>And now there’s a version with subs too. <br/></br></br>  <br>Thanks!</br>   This episode <br> Kirika's transformation <br>I knew she was pure sex but my body was not ready</br></br>  <br><br><br>This is so fucking good, man.<br><br>So fucking good.</br></br></br></br></br>  So how long until someone makes it and posts pictures.  <br>Why did Hibiki go full moral fag. <br><br>I wanna see her go berserk and legit kill a doll then pan to Maria's horrified face cause she feels bad for telling her to go fight,</br></br></br>  <br>Carol dredged up her survivor's guilt.</br>  <br>That’s probably going to happen. This season is incredibly packed, Hibiki has her own issues but so do the other characters and Maria’s speech was definitely part of that, if they can address two issues in one, they’re probably going to do it , </br>  <br>Maria would only care if it's Phara. Maria got to see Tsubasa naked thanks to her.</br>  <br> implying Maria isn't going to take Gungnir from Hibiki and have an awesome fight with it </br>  <br>She's always been full moralfag. It just hasn't been such an issue because the situation has never been this dire. <br>Chris would run from Hibiki's moralfaggotry, Ryoko was too overconfident and Maria was receptive to the moralfaggotry. <br><br>This is just a situation where people are getting actually killed and Hibiki's ideals are being brought to the foreground and pitted against the grindstone to either be turned to dust or to be sharpened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're going to be telling Hibiki,<br> They aren't human, punch them. <br>All season aren't they?</br></br></br>  <br>Even Genjuro thinks she's fucking crazy</br>  <br>Dolls have feelings too.</br>  <br> Zerbikki literally rips and tears one of the dolls apart <br> cut to everyone's horrified reaction </br></br>  <br><br>he should of went through with going there and fucked them up</br></br>  <br>Maria is more receptive but is also more willing to wreck people.<br><br>That part when she went apeshit at the Americans shooting innocent bystanders was like one of the only times she was cool</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot<br> BOHSOH DATTO!? </br></br>  <br> killing Carol's only friends </br>  <br>Maybe the animator realized that kirika's tranformation in G is a piece of shit that can't be redeemed.</br>  Good lord, I've had Exterminate on loop since I downloaded it earlier. Am I alone in thinking this is the best of the three OPs by far? Audio-wise, at least.  <br>Their porcelain and plastic, not people.</br>  <br>It's also basically the exact thing people want Hibiki to do.</br>  <br> hibiki finally snaps and "murders" a doll <br> she's horrified and makes everyone feel bad for the constant bitching about her refusing to kill them <br>I'd be okay with that.</br></br></br>  <br>Porcelain and plastic don't make funny faces like that</br>  <br> Not the gigantic pantsu shot while she's pole dancing with her scythe's shaft. </br>  <br>Or she kills a doll and everyone says "One less horrible monster to worry about killing innocent people. Good job."<br><br>But that won't happen because it won't let Hibiki get preachy with divine justification on her side.</br></br></br>  <br>It's that kind of reasoning which is why people are hating on Hibiki at the moment. <br><br>She's not sticking the fist of God into Dolls and people are upset about that. <br>I'm not sure why people would be under the assumption Hibiki would fare better than Tsubasa or Chris whilst having to protect four other people. <br><br>Fighting in the end would probably just aggravate the situation and make it worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>She has homunculus too.</br>  <br>I dunno, if she gets to the point where she's actually ripping dolls apart she'll probably be the only one who ISN'T horrified about it. Since apparently she's incapable of fighting unless her mental state lines up exactly.</br>  <br>She's going to be horrified after she finishes ripping them apart.</br>  <br>Chris is 5', B90/W57/H85 of soft moe.</br>  <br>Shirabe is so lucky.</br>  <br>It's alchemy and memories, I don't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br> soft moe. <br>She's also fiesty and hotblooded, wants to be a cool senpai, has the best eating habits, the fluffiest hair and the best speech patterns.</br></br>  <br>She can join them if she wants to.</br>  <br>Isn't it more about wanting her to follow the Touma method? Talk to people and try to come to an understanding. If that doesn't work and they insist on doing bad things, punch them until they stop hurting innocents. Once they stop being assholes, then you can be friends forever. Talking first is important of course.</br>  <br>In brief, she's perfect.</br>  <br>Do they have vajayjays</br>  Maria's going to get her moment this season, it's just a question of when. It'd be fantastic if she showed up and told Biki to get her shit together and we got a last hurrah of Black Gungnir before Airgetlam takes center stage. Bonus points if Maria takes Gungnir, transforms, and no longer has her cape but still kicks Blue's ass all up and down the sidewalk.<br><br>Realistically, Maria is never going to use Gungnir again and we're going to be waiting a few more episodes before Airgetlam happens.</br></br>  <br>The perfectest.<br><br>They better bring the fucking "Bang!" back at least once this season.</br></br></br>  Maybe all Hibiki needs is a good dose of linker, what could possibly go wrong?  <br>She's the MC of this show that doesn't need logic and shit to be strong and always bullshits her way out of everything, of course everyone will expect her to do better than Tsubasa and Chris</br>  <br>If Elfnein doesn't they probably don't either.</br>  <br>It will be back, cowboy bebop style</br>  <br>She's wielding a sword that's carrying a lot of memories. <br><br>I originally thought she could never be worthy, but she just might surprise us.</br></br></br>  <br>They'll have to fight with Tsubasa's ultra autism first before they inject LiNKER to Hibiki.</br>  WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?  <br>Pandering to Otaku faggots</br>  <br><br>Improvement</br></br>  <br>It's actually an improvement, the manga version of her looks extremely edgy. Kinda like Jormungand and Attack of Titan</br>  <br>Tits still look pretty big.</br>  <br><br>She got Barakamon'd.</br></br>  <br><br>She wasn't kawaii enough for Japan and this isn't Berserk so she had to be a fap fodder target.<br><br>They totally ruined her unfortunately.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Right looks better.</br>  <br><br>It's going to be interesting how they animate  her beating the shit out of the prince with her bare fists .</br></br>  <br>Left looks like a american version of right.</br>  <br>Who put revy in a helmet?</br>  <br> they won't </br>  <br><br/></br>  God damn the one on the left looks like some sort of cock monster semen demon in a cow tit doujin.  <br> left <br>manga<br><br> right <br>LN</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pandering</br>  Anime is better.  <br>she was always fap fodder (did you even read the manga?)<br><br>just now she looks less like a man</br></br></br>  <br>Ami decided to enlist</br>  <br><br>to sell more</br></br>  I don't even watch it and yet that change makes me extremely happy because it's the sort of thing that would make the kind of faggot this is aimed at mad as fuck.  <br> MC is an otaku </br>  <br> Take character <br> Change entirely <br> THIS IS OKAY AND SHOULD NOT WARRANT A PERSON OR FIVE GETTING FIRED <br><br><br>Burn that thing on a pyre anon</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should tell that to the manga artist.</br>  <br>One helluva downgrade.</br>  <br>But Barakamon is less moeshit than this.</br>  <br>"We want Idolmaster audience" happened.</br>  <br>Will the mangafags stop complaining anytime soon? We get it, you fucking hate it. How many threads has it been already?</br>  <br>to be fair we haven't seen her with her helmet off yet<br><br>she looks like a Shota protagonist currently<br>her nickname is Shortstacks, she's not tall</br></br></br></br>  <br> moeshit </br>   Hurr durr muh designs <br><br>Why are you faggots so anal about this shit? Nobody fucking cares</br></br>  <br>They'll never stop, and that's fine. Nobody gives a fuck if animeonlyfags are butthurt.</br>  <br> MC is an Otaku <br>i've dropped this series after i knew this fact</br></br>  <br><br><br>Cancer</br></br></br>  <br> 35 years old <br>I want to be her husbando tbh.</br></br>  <br>It's A1 and they took the moeshit route.<br><br>They even censored the jabs at China and only portrayed Darrel's Administration.</br></br></br>  <br>It'll be hilarious if a little army girl beats the shit out of the prince.</br>  <br>Why do you get so butthurt with this? They clearly improved her design to suit the current trend or it wont sell. She's much cuter now though her masculinity has been toned down to the extreme but at least they keep the bust size the same as before. <br><br>I read the manga and i think anime design is much better.</br></br></br>  <br>It because you're a moefag of course you love that frail looking grill with big eyes. At later scene when she do some badass scene no doubt it will be laughable with her current design right now. i had enough with current manga direction right now with all of the sudden harem pandering now we got some shitty studio trying to moefy the show.</br>  <br>No, that's Mami, stupid.</br>  <br>I enjoy moe ironically though, there's no point in resisting it since you can do nothing against it.</br>  <br> MUH MANGA DESIGN <br>Yea well she looks fucking disgusting in the manga, at least now we can see she is a woman, stop thinking you are special just cause you read the manga, because you are not, and your opinion will still be shit regardless of the media you use.<br><br> Inb4 moeshit </br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Actually, her LN design is more like the manga design.<br>Most of the characters in the Anime look like either the LN or manga design, but she was given a new design completely.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128270662 <br>This. Are you finally realizing what moeshit does? It spreads to other anime and manga like a disease.</br>   being surprised when Japan turns nearly every woman into fap fodder, usually by pandering to a very narrow set of what mainstream otaku find attractive   Didn't someone post some other pages showing OP to be misleading last time?  <br>She's fucking 24.</br>  <br>The LN came after the manga you know. Also she doesn't look at all like that in the LN.</br>  Cowtit lovers getting destroyed.  <br>she got idolmasterified, wich is fucking disgusting.</br>  moefags ruin everything  lol I was going to put together OP's pic but I'm too lazy.... still, saved  <br><br><br><br>Get used to it, fags. Heh</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not like it's a new occurrence</br>  Anime was kill in 2007. You can only cry now.  Move along, nothing to see here...  <br>Look at that ordinance</br>  <br>Wow, that's horrible. The left looks much more likable, while the right is just forgettable.</br>  <br> those tits <br>the only reason im actually mad about the anime design is that we won't get to see this scene, or at least it won't be so great as in the manga</br></br>  <br> edgy <br>Uhhhhhhhh</br></br>  <br><br>You now realize Kuri's greatest feat of strength is being able to stand straight.</br></br>  Honestly, why should you care? The anime is toned down trash anyway. Expect many other things to be changed and most probably cut.<br><br><br>This is /b/-grade logic.</br></br></br>  <br>unf<br>those muscles</br></br>  <br>They upgraded to a better design, now it looks like a girl.</br>  They fucked it all up. The whole show. Expect so many things to be left out or just modified to be kawaii uguu.  I just hope they keep Rory's expressions intact.  <br>Why are you such a fucking liar?<br><br>Or totally ignorant?</br></br></br>  <br>Dropped.</br>  <br>So, you're telling me I should avoid the anime and just read the manga, huh?</br>  Okay, what got 'censored' in the anime?<br><br>Did they omit scenes from the source material? I didn't notice any blatant blacked out spots on the video.</br></br>  <br>Left's tits are fucking disgusting, so I don't even have an issue with this.</br>  <br>Just edgy shit like war rape.</br>  <br>Yeah. Fuck this series. Fuck the guy who recommended it to me. Fuck anyone who calls this 'anime of the season' or a 'must watch'.</br>  <br> real things that happen in war are portrayed in a war manga <br> edgy </br></br>  <br>There are some parts of Rory's introduction that got toned-down and ironically made her look like less of a good person. A big part of Tuka's (the elf) introduction got moved around, but there's no way we won't see it because it becomes a pretty big plot point later on.</br>  <br>They're beautiful, faggot.</br>  <br>Web Novel: 2006<br>Novel: 2010<br>Manga: 2011<br>Light Novel: 2012<br><br>The Novel didn't have illustrations, beyond the cover.<br><br><br>Violence was toned down. The scale of the invasion in the first episode was massively played down.<br>The dragon fight was extremely tame—not only does it laugh at you by saying there are a lot of bodies and that's it, they tried so hard not to show a speck of blood that you can't even tell that the Dragon's arm was blown off, unless you actually know it happened before hand, because of all the smoke.<br>I've seen people mention how nothing hurt the dragon, only to be surprised when told the dragon's arm was blown off, and they had to go back and verify.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are they animating it if they're just going to piss all over the material?</br>  <br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Gate_-_Thus_the_JSD<wbr>F_Fought_There:Rory_the_Reaper<br>The manga actually added to that scene, so yeah.</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Where did all these huge fans of the manga come from, anyway? It's not like there were a ton of threads beforehand, and people in them mostly seemed to just be reading casually for the nippon stronk shit and Rori. Now all of a sudden people are bitching left and right about how the anime is pandering garbage that ruined the whole thing.</br>  <br>Because ¢a$h baby</br>  <br>They turned her into a generic girl who is clearly not fit enough to work for the military. I mean seriously she has no muscles, when we get to her badass scene's it's just going to look weird as with the Anime design she clearly doesn't possess the strength or stamina to do it.</br>  <br>Before, the threads were mostly monthly, following a new manga chapter release.<br><br>More recently, the threads picked up a lot of pace, but they still existed before, and there was a good following.</br></br></br>  <br> Now all of a sudden people are bitching left and right about how the anime is pandering garbage that ruined the whole thing. <br>Really? I mean holy shit this is already a series about an otaku going to a fantasy world and being surrounded by a harem of girls while saying JAPAN IS THE GREATEST NATION LONG LIVE THE RISING SUN<br><br>How can you pander harder?</br></br></br></br>  <br>cause its charting as well as Charlotte</br>  <br>Toning down the violence seems like a really negative point.</br>  <br>when it takes away from the story then yeah</br>  <br>You don't need the gore to enjoy the story. Maybe you need it, but the story doesn't.</br>  <br>Anon I don't "need" it, but if the whole point of the violence and shit was to expand the story, then yeah I think it's a bad thing.</br>  <br>What's wrong with gore and violence?</br>  <br>See<br><br/></br></br>  <br> JAPAN IS THE GREATEST NATION LONG LIVE THE RISING SUN <br>Wrong. He's a "humanity fuck yeah" kind of guy.</br></br>  So they replaced a kickass tomboy with a bubbly generic. <br><br>How the fuck is she going to manage this scene?</br></br>  So I heard that this was originally a novel that was adapted into a light novel, then a manga and now an anime. Supposedly it was toned down after each adaptation.<br><br>If so, how fucked up was the original novel? Or did it only tone down the rampant nationalism / JSDF propaganda?</br></br>  <br>It's going to look even more ridiculous now if she beats up the prince.</br>  <br>The story of war isn't believable if it isn't gorey.</br>  <br>Don't forget massacring the kings guard with a LMG.</br>  <br>deleted scene<br>just like the bandit rape scene<br>there will be no monster tits ether<br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This world needs more yanki girls, tomboys, etc.<br><br><br>It wasn't fucked up. It just had a lot of political rambling and Japanese nationalism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of that scene, why the hell was she using a bayonet against a bunch of armored sword &amp; shield users? How would that be effective at all?</br>  <br>You get stabbed in the neck it doesnt matter how much armor you got on</br>  <br>It's a bit more important to the storyline.</br>  <br>It was originally webnovel, then a novel, then a manga, then a light novel and now it has other random things too. The original webnovel was pretty strong in the japan strong and horrible politics and also a lot of bad ends for the characters.</br>  <br>Been saying that for a while.</br>  <br>The bayonet just so happened to have an automatic weapon attached to it.</br>  <br>but if they cant show how brutal he was towards his slaves, why should they brutaly kick his ass and put the peace treaty at risk</br>      <br> pokes a full grown mad with a bayonet <br> full grown man goes flying <br>Oh boy this is going to be fun..</br></br></br>  <br> using a bayonet against a bunch of armored sword &amp; shield users? <br><br>Yeah that was bullshit. They gave us some crap about her having some badge in close quarters combat or something, but she's taking on a bunch of people who are outfitted and trained precisely to fight against melee weapons. A bayonet isn't even such a hot weapon compared to dedicated melee weapons like swords and pikes and shit, it's an afterthought on a ranged weapon.</br></br></br>  <br> and also a lot of bad ends for the characters. <br>Like what?<br><br>I don't like spoilers but I guess it's safe to assume the manga is gonna stick to the second novel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shino is so fucking good</br>  <br>Yep she's one of the most entertaining characters in the story along with Rory.</br>  <br>Someone said that the web novel ended with Itami killing himself.<br><br>Of course, this isn't the case in the novel, light novel, nor should it be in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't refute my point. The anime didn't explicitly state that the bandits were also raping people. Sure, this is sort of implied by the fact that they're bandits, but if the suffering they were causing got a little more focus, everyone would have been much more excited about Rory killing them rather than nonplussed because generic hurr durr bandits are bad.</br>  <br>She has lighter combat armor and a bayonet is just as good as a sword, just way lighter. She's also pretty strong AND fast. I don't see how any of that is bullshit when she just cut their unprotected necks.</br>  <br>She only stabbed two or three of them. The vast majority of them were shot.</br>  <br><br>Aren't most medieval soldiers extremely large armies like these just peasants that have been through formation training exercises and the most basic of basic weapons training?</br></br>  <br> unprotected necks <br><br>Do you think some soldier with a friggin shield and melee combat training might... oh I don't know... block her?</br></br></br>  <br>Better reach and intimidation factor go a long way. Also, fucking learn to ignore petty details like that, it's a fucking anime and her specialization is CQC.</br>  <br>Oh jeez, that sounds hardcore. This has piqued my interest.<br><br><br>See ,  and .<br><br>Also remember they had to use peasants for guards and stuff after the massacre when the JSDF first entered the gate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I guess it's safe to assume the manga is gonna stick to the second novel. <br>Of course it is. The manga and light novel are both adaptations of the published novel after all. The webnovel's story is a lot different.</br></br>  <br>She does though.</br>  <br>This makes me super curious.</br>  <br><br>Anywhere I can read the original ending?</br></br>  <br>Yes, but I see her taking on soldiers clad in plate armor in the palace. Those guys are not some pitiful peasant<br><br><br> Better reach and intimidation factor go a long way. <br>A bayonet is a kitchen knife on a short stick. It doesn't exactly have a lot of reach. Also why would soldiers be intimidated by a woman they never saw before?</br></br></br></br></br>  This show is dumb.  <br> Also why would soldiers be intimidated by a woman they never saw before? <br>Because she just stabbed that dude in the fucking neck. Is it that hard to understand?</br></br>    <br> Also why would soldiers be intimidated by a woman they never saw before? <br>It's obvious you read the manga so I don't even know how you didn't notice how shocked they were when they were told these guys were from the jayesdeef.</br></br>  <br>You seem to have ignored the most important point. I'll quote it so you can read it again.<br> learn to ignore petty details like that, it's a fucking anime and her specialization is CQC </br></br>  <br>I want to know the original ending.</br>  <br> WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED? <br>Is a miracle.<br><br>The manga art was so shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because she just stabbed that dude in the fucking neck. Is it that hard to understand? <br><br>You think soldiers in a medieval army get intimidated when someone on their side gets stabbed? Seriously? What the fuck do you think these people were doing in the battlefield?<br><br><br> they were told these guys were from the jayesdeef <br>The enemy at Itarica didn't know shit about who these guys were<br><br><br> learn to ignore petty details like that, it's a fucking anime and her specialization is CQC <br>Just say it's anime bro. You can leave out the lolrandom extra reasons as if you know wth you're talking about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and a :^) for you</br>  <br>Shit tastes abound.</br>    <br>I'm sure even a veteran from Irag must be very surprised when a dude next to him suddenly gets shot from nowhere. You know what I'm talking about</br>  <br>they improved her obviously</br>  <br>They're not americans in Iraq fighting a long range war where you cover in a ditch all day and losing someone is somewhat rare. It's a fucking medieval army storming city walls. A shitload of people getting stabbed and maimed all over the place is the norm.</br>    oops, wrong post<br><br>see<br/></br></br>  <br>Now imagine you were in Iraq and only had swords and shields then the first woman you've ever seen on a battlefield kills your comrades extremely effectively.</br>  What would the  Paizuri  feel like?    <br> The enemy at Itarica didn't know shit about who these guys were <br>The scene at the capital is months later than Italica.</br></br>  <br> The scene at the capital is months later than Italica. <br><br>Yes, dude, we know, she was also being a melee badass at Italika, keep up</br></br></br>  <br>ANIME IS DEAD BABY</br>  <br>Artistic liberties ruining things again.</br>  <br>Maybe this series would've been better as some violent 80s ova.</br>  <br>you realize this now? The nips could have had their nippon bonzai and titties and we could have had our gore /k/ and titties<br>Everyone would have been happy</br></br>  Stupid bitch had to be blinded by hate when she could've had a happy ending with him.<br><br>;_;</br></br>  <br>This makes me very very sad.</br>  <br>Is that Tomita?</br>  <br>No  it's the chef guy. Tomita and Bozes got their happy end.  </br>  <br> Furuta, the chef </br>   what happened <br>Someone decided Gate was worth another adaption despite the fact that it's mind-bogglingly dull and retarded.</br>  <br>not enough moeshit for you?</br>  It must be the same guy making template posts about how the show is bad.  <br><br>I see, he reminded me of Tomita because of the hairstyle, my bad.</br></br>  <br>Look at the OP picture, it went full moeshit.</br>  <br>I guess moeshit sells better than gory violence.</br>  <br>Try again, faggot. Try reading Drifters instead if you want a decent "eras collide" scenario.</br>   Post yfw when the ''WOAH, WOAH, WOAH, WOAH'' part starts playing in the OP   <br>Oh, I heard of that. Isn't it by the same guy who did Hellsing.</br>  <br>Someone post that Shirobako image about manga vs anime changes.</br>  <br>And it's better than Hellsing.</br>  <br>Yea it's pretty good.</br>   apologizing before cutting into elf's shirt <br><br>ARE THE JPS REALLY THIS POLITE<br><br>IT'S LIFE OR DEATH<br><br>JUST DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO SAVE HER LIFE<br><br>GOD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I should stop being lazy and check it out.</br></br>  <br>I don't have the original but this is fine.</br>  <br>I am empty.</br>  <br>this can't be real</br>  <br>Shino-san!</br>  <br>Which scans are the best for Drifters?</br>  This is the future you chose weeb shits.

Why? Because a pleb with a spear can kill a knight before the knight can reach him. Even better if the knight is mounted.<br>The same shit goes into modern physical combat. reach = advantage.<br><br>so its bullshit, but not bullshit because "muh training" or "bayonet is useless afterthought lmao."<br>It's bullshit because of the number of people more than any other reason, shields being a close second.<br><br>/k/ out</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  is this neo-/a/  <br>Welcome to Hell</br>  <br> apologizing before cutting into elf's shirt <br>I didn't have a problem with that.

The contrast between being a military officer and an otaku is just so random! That's a very clever joke if I do say so myself. I just love the juxtaposition of Itami being conflicted with doing the correct thing for SDF, and revealing his otaku power level (his favorite is Gothic lolis which are irresistible to him). God I love this anime, haha. Can't get enough!  <br>What a fantastic asshole.</br>  <br><br><br>Die</br></br></br>  <br>Man you're post is so witty and funny haha! <br> kill yourself. </br></br>  <br>Chen pls  stay </br>  <br> mad because they're right </br>  <br>I know this is easy shitposting for you but let's be perfectly honest. If you think right is better you truly have awful taste.</br>  <br>Nobody tells chen where to stay or go motherfucker.</br>  <br>Not was witty and funny as this show!</br>    <br>SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS</br>  <br> So yes indeed a fucking spear beats swords in that is has a much longer range. <br><br> this nigga right here <br><br>Dumbass when you hold a rifle with two hands, what extends beyond your outmost hand is a little bit of the barrel and the bayonet. A spear extends much further. Holy shit, just google some images and compare lengths.<br><br>As far as the manga goes look at the top left panel of  and see how much her weapon extends beyond her hand in comparison to the guy's sword. And that's just a fucking sword.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/c<wbr>ontrast%20military%20officer%20otak<wbr>u/</wbr></wbr></br>  What a disservice I was doing myself by not reading this sooner.  <br>The fuck is with this typesetting?

Her intro was top notch, but going from edgy black lipstick KILL EVERYTHING to generic cutesy girl felt off. Her whole character is off, honestly. <br><br>In the manga, she's pretty much just a random hazard for the enemy.

She even learns of him being a spy (he's pretty much incapable of lying, a horrible choice to send in as a spy) but keeps it a secret. She finds herself more and more attracted to her, and acts like a young girl in love for the first time around him. Furuta also finds her attractive, and wishes her to come with him to Japan and open a restaurant together.<br><br>Ultimately her vengeance gets better of her, and rejects Fufuta's offer, and chooses to see her plan to the end.<br>The Prince finds out about her schemes at one point, beats her and rapes her, but doesn't kill her.

There is very little if any otaku-related things he does during the story, at least as afar as the manga goes</br>  <br>He refused to get off his ass and fight the dragon for like 30 chapters anon...what the fuck are you even talking about? He's far and away from some Shounen bitch or even some army faggot<br><br>Also, recall that this was written by an otaku in the JSDF originally...</br></br></br>  <br>Normalfag as fuck. I mean how vanilla can one even get with a fantasy harem?</br>  <br>human, elf and hundreds year old loli is the most common love interest in fantasy setting.</br>  <br>Do you want him to start drawing doujins or wear an anime shirt? Him being an otaku is background, there's nothing wrong with that. Don't be so cynical.</br>  <br>Don't forget to tip your fedora on your way out.</br>  <br>Spoiler heavy response:<br> Once the Prince goes on coup d'etat he sends out these inquisitors that captures and tortures Empire officials who has ties with JSDF<br>Sherry's parents are on the hit list, and they buy time so Sherry and her uncle can flee.

Normalfag would be him falling for regular village girls with mature bodies. He likes Magical girl, very similar to Leilei and Rory.</br>  <br><br>So does Itami just end up alone/in an ambiguous situation?</br></br>  <br> Also there's plenty of nerds in the military <br><br>Thanks God we're defended by FREEDOM MILITARY</br></br></br>  <br>Do these two.</br>  <br> He refused to get off his ass and fight the dragon for like 30 chapters anon <br>First his superior denied the request, then when he was finally allowed he took the time to come up with a strategy instead of going in like a rambo wannabee and getting wasted.

There's a difference between an anime/manga fan and an otaku and he's supposed to be the later<br><br><br> He's always spending his money on manga and figures, attending cons <br>Where is this in the manga? All I saw was him visiting a single con and having some exposition in the very first chapter. Hey guys, this guy is just like you!). Then 40 chapters of him being an army dude (actually no, he's not just like you)<br><br> and is a complete slacker <br>lol I just keep hearing that, but not once do you actually see him do this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> &gt;and is a complete slacker <br> lol I just keep hearing that, but not once do you actually see him do this <br>Every fucking one says this.

I keep hearing this, but not once do I see him like hiding in the nearby forest to avoid some duty or some shit.</br></br>  <br>He's on duty, what's wrong with you?<br><br> lol I just keep hearing that, but not once do you actually see him do this. <br>When he's revealed to be a ranger we can see an image of him lazing around reading light novels.</br></br></br></br>    So I was rereading and caught this<br>Is she supposed to be crying in this scene?</br>    <br> He's on duty, what's wrong with you? <br>Clearly you've never been in the armed forces<br><br> When he's revealed to be a ranger we can see an image of him lazing around reading light novels. <br>Yeah, when he's been anything but a slacker for like 40 chapters you're gonna have to do better than a momentary flashback that to convince me. <br><br>My point is either make him an actual slacker or spare me the he's-just-like-you-lazy-otaku-so-bu<wbr>y-this-maga bullshit</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that kids is how I met your mother.</br>  <br>meant to quote </br>  <br>You're grasping for straws at this point.<br><br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-NM<wbr>ph943tsw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How is this relevant to anything, I dont even</br></br>  <br> You're grasping for straws at this point. <br><br>lol if anyone's grasping at straws it's you bro. I laid out my reasoning and all I got is "You're grasping for straws at this point."<br><br>Come back when you haven't ran out of arguments</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> woman in the military <br><br>Anon she is fapbait in the LN, manga and anime, who the fuck would want a realistic military unit full of 30 years old dudes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How did the inquisitors die? Did they get mowed down by the SDF?</br></br>  <br>Are you serious? Even in the novel shes small but has a large build. Prince gets his ass beat by brute force.

Well it just doesnt fit.</br>  <br>cute smug anime girl dude</br>    <br>  realistic military unit full of 30 years old dudes. <br>I thought most military unit range around 18-25 years old?</br></br>  <br> little army girl <br><br><br/></br></br></br>  So what's up with the ALLCAPS in the scanlated manga?  <br> Yeah, when he's been anything but a slacker for like 40 chapters you're gonna have to do better than a momentary flashback that to convince me. <br>It's not only about being lazy, part of his characters is avoiding conflict and being softhearted.<br><br> he's-just-like-you-lazy-otaku-so-b<wbr>uy-this-maga bullshit</wbr> <br>Yeah, we get it, you're too smart to fall for the author's dirty tricks. Complaining about the author making identifiable characters is something kids who only read/watch anime do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No, you. <br><br>Ok.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sans nationalistic ramblings, has the manga been following the novels basically beat for beat?</br></br>  <br><br> Come back when you haven't ran out of arguments <br><br> reply with 0 arguments <br><br>Ok.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, she's pretty.</br>  <br>You were too stupid to even discuss your grasping for straws (but you sure made your point with a reaction pic), so what's the point?</br>  <br>Afaik they've mostly been the same.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> Her and glasses got set up in the hospital and she just poured herself on him for her actions. Soon enough they bonded and she even got a nice ring with it. </br>  All these spoilers just make me even more thirsty for new chapters, god damn.  <br> It's not only about being lazy, part of his characters is avoiding conflict and being softhearted. <br>First it was otaku, then it was lazy, now you're talking about avoiding conflict and being softhearted. When you stop moving the goal posts let me know.<br><br> Complaining about the author making identifiable characters is something kids who only read/watch anime do. <br>I didn't complain about the author making identifiable characters. I complained about him doing a bad job of it. And it has nothing to do with the medium.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>most mangafags hated the series for its jingoism even before the anime.<br><br>manga isn't even the source material</br></br></br>  <br> First it was otaku, then it was lazy, now you're talking about avoiding conflict and being softhearted. When you stop moving the goal posts let me know. <br>So being an otaku in the army comes with no personality traits whatsoever? do you want a flat character or you're just bitching for the sake of it, I wonder?</br></br>  <br> whaawhaa why doesn't she look like shit ;_; <br><br>get real niggers</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128287125 <br>I guess it's my fault for discussing with a little kid, then.</br>  <br>I want to see the retarded prince getting his ass kicked again.<br><br>He does a lot of despicable shit in the novels.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Got it.<br><br>Poor Bunny Queen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't that PSIA guy tell Itami that he respected him for  playing  the slacker, so that no one else would turn into one?</br>  <br>So this anime cutie is supposed to rek the shit prince later on?<br><br>Not believable.</br></br></br>  <br>see<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128287125 <br><br><br> So being an otaku in the army comes with no personality traits whatsoever? do you want a flat character or you're just bitching for the sake of it, I wonder? <br>Maybe you should try reading what I wrote, repeatedly now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't be surprised at all if they just leave that out.</br>  <br><br>Just goes to show that improvement isn't always a good thing.</br></br>   &gt;Zenzeinic game <br><br>Ripping of Touhou, Adult Swim?<br>Jeez, man.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm so happy I decided to read the manga instead. It's always fucking better to read the manga instead.</br>  <br>I don't think it's even going to get that far. I think the furthest they'll get is the spaw/Inn and then it'll just be dropped after a cliff hanger. Shit's going so slow and everything's just kinda getting glossed over so far.</br>    <br>???</br>  <br>I used to be an animeonlyfag, and now that many mangas I've read are getting adaptations I can tell how fucking terrible most animes are.</br>  <br>Why do they always fuck up so badly? Change things just to boost sales?</br>  <br>Quick, marry it before it spoils</br>  <br>the only problem with Drifters is the pacing is so god damn slow. They still haven't actually done anything besides recapture the capital.</br>  <br>Another addition to the list of reasons I'll be sticking to the manga.</br>  <br>The thing is I don't even think they need to make it quite as grim as the manga to give the action and events the proper feeling of impact and brutality, just a touch more would probably do the job, but right now the show just feel really sterile to a fault.<br><br>I'm not a violence hound by any stretch but the action in this needs a punch that's just not present. Watching today's episode of Rokka No Yuusha for example, that's not a very graphic show by any means, but when it needed a properly bloody scene to communicate that a desperate struggle had occurred before the characters arrived, it went for it and it worked.<br><br>I don't dislike the anime so far really, it's fine, but the missed opportunity factor is definitely hard to shake because the most minor of alterations could make it great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't really, sure there are a few uniquely anime changes that are dumb, but 90% of the things people complain about when it comes to adaptations are the same shit people complain about when western books are made into movies or shows. Different medium, different amount of time, different people working on the project. That never sits well, and yet every time all the fans act so surprised.</br>  <br>Honestly, the cut-to-black scenes are rubbing me more like "Buy the blu-rays, bitch".</br>  Why aren't there any doujins of this?  <br>LN/manga don't usually get alot of buzz. It will get some porn as the anime airs.</br>  <br> Just goes to show that improvement isn't always a good thing. </br>  <br>I'm guessing he meant "change".</br>  <br> It will get some porn as the anime airs. <br> Kuribayashi will be drawn in her anime form </br></br>    <br>Uchida Maaya auditioned for Rory, but she didn't get the part. The staff felt bad for not giving well known seiyuu a role so they redesigned a character to fit her voice.<br><br>Source:  My ass. </br></br></br>  Could have been a decent series if they had kept muh politics out of it. Too bad the author was also a right wing nutcase and couldn't keep his crazy out of his work.  <br>It's hard to take seriously anyone who still uses "muh ___".</br>  <br>No, i'm not an animeonlyfag, but I don't read manga with shitty art. I think the anime has improved on the manga despite it being necessarily watered down. Of course most mangafags are absolutely autistic, so we have to continuously deal with their whining about it being changed slightly, good or bad.<br><br>For example, the character redesigns are amazing, way better than their counterparts I have seen in the pages posted. But then we also have to deal with a lot of censorship, I can understand it to a point, but I think they have gone too far. Another negative difference is the 3d animations, particularly the dragon from last episode, but I would personally prefer a 3d dragon that looks slightly less threatening than the original, than have the 3 episodes afterward include a lot of QUALITY due to the fact they spent their budget on animating a massive dragon.<br><br>Do any of the mangafags understand the amount of work that has to go into this animation? with the massive difference in the amount of time available to make it? its not going to be perfect, and its going to be different, even so, I think A-1 has done a brilliant job so far.<br><br>I'm not trying to say to overlook the mistakes, but so many people seem to be overlooking the good because a proportionally tiny amount of bad.<br><br><br> Urgh my chubby cowtits terribly designed character has been improved into a character that doesn't put off half the audience who will be helping A-1 get the money they need to make the anime, its different ahhhhhh. <br>I'll admit that they probably could of kept the same hair style and are more similar uniform to stay truer to the original, but holy shit, does it warrant this amount of whining?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Such an odd directorial choice, million better ways to communicate that.</br>  <br>Do it right or don't do it at all.</br>  <br>He's just taking responsibility for penetrating her body.</br>  <br>Does people being unhappy about character designs warrant this amount of whining?</br>  <br>Look at that wall of text.</br>  <br>I don't see any nationalism in the manga at all, to be honest. All I see is a bunch of justified HFY from Itami.</br>  I think the manga version with just smaller tits would be best.  <br>Christ she was ugly. Thank you A-1.</br>  <br>Nice wall of text there, captain shit taste.</br>  <br>there is so much wrong with this I actually laughed a bit</br>  Guys guys. What if the gate causes strong electro-magnetic disturbances and fucks up all electronics that aren't EMP-shielded?<br><br>Japan can only afford to transport smaller vehicles and electronics in EMP-shielded containers and a handful of attack helicopters through the gate. No tanks or heavy artillery, yet.<br><br>Japanese congress or whatever is only willing to risk less than 5% in the endeavor so about 10k like what was originally stated, and the citizens and foreign nations have a legit reason to fear some kind of defeat.<br><br>So setting up a base at Alnus takes a fuck ton more time and effort. They have to rely heavily on hand-dug trenchs,sandbags, and mortars.<br><br>The night-time raid is actually effective and the Japanese front-line is forced to retreat. But it's all according to Keikaku. The notro-mans get baited into a mine field, mortars, and heavy gun-fire. Some faggots don't retreat and die trying to rambo the monstermen.<br><br>The rest of the "invasion" should center around their lack of budget and equipment and having to use real tactics in forest, mountain, and urban settings against larger forces and magic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know, they could of at least had the characters have a reaction when returning to see the bodies.<br><br><br> Do it right <br>Are you thinking doing everything exactly the same even if it can be improved upon is doing it right? I admit there are many things they changed unnecessarily, but it doesn't warrant overlooking what has been improved upon.<br><br><br>If some people dislike the changes in character design I can understand that, it doesn't mean that you need to claim the rest of the anime is shit, the character this thread is making an example of looks like something from a cheap doujin.<br><br><br><br>I haven't said anything up to this point despite the amount of threads complaining about the changes, it happens every season, but this is just excessive. I wasn't trying to talk much about my taste, but rather from a point of view taking into consideration the demographics and budget required to make this anime successful as well, what does include my opinion, is how I think they have made the right choices for the most part to achieve this goal while making a good anime. There have been some flawed direction choices. What I don't get is how so many mangafags think the manga is fucking holy and perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Corazon spoke at last, and his voice is deeper than Evangelion.  <br>Is it sexy though?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  There will be no new Nakama for another arc.<br>Source: My dad was hired by Oda to ensure that he has a lit cigarette in his mouth at all times.</br>  <br>Frankly it makes him sound like he's 50, but it is sexy.</br>  <br> first post is a gay post <br><br>thread is starting off the right way</br></br></br>  <br>Sexy sexy beast Corazon was, waste of a character to just let this sexy man die.</br>  <br>that it bothers you so much makes me want to do it more<br><br>you really should learn to chill, it's just a picture and not even a gay one</br></br></br>  <br>Gay you say?</br>   next episode adapts the road trip <br> literally the perfect opportunity for some anime original scenes since so much of it was offscreen <br> instead the preview shows that we are BREAKING AWAY from the flashback for BellamyvsLuffy filler <br><br>This just makes no sense at all.<br>Is Toei actively trying to ruin this now?

I wasn't put off by Ace's voice at all.<br>I don't think Corazon's voice is that offputting either but it'll take some getting used to.

Jeez his voice is deeper than Doffy's</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people who don't want to be seen always wear the most suspicious looking hood ever ?</br>  <br>Cause he listens to what others say and thinks rationally.

Just more of Law's crew in general.</br></br></br>  <br>becaayse I dont take credit for other people's stuff</br>  <br>I don't think Jean Bart could be a dentist with hands that big. <br><br>Then again, who am I to question his dreams...</br></br></br>  <br>You're such a commendable man.</br>  <br>How the fuck did I spell Because so wrong</br>  <br>you're having a stroke, anon<br><br>get help quickly</br></br></br>  dumping favourite picture of best boy from last thread  <br>Thanks for the concern, though the doctor wont be this fucking based</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128281130 <br>Tell him he has big hands. Then he becomes a pirate. Like Jean Bart.</br>  <br>no I suppose you can't beat a doctor with a doctor tied to his head</br>  <br>they do say 2 heads are better then 1</br>  <br>Just check if you can stand on one foot with your tongue sticking out and your arms up without falling over.</br>  <br>Here's another one from that artist.</br>  I'm sharing this image because I haven't watched the episode yet. And because it looks nice although kind of out of character. But, yeah, they could've been cute bros. Law would be so spoiled.    <br>Thank you</br>  <br>Shit if my dentist with parkinson's still hasn't seriously injured someone yet then i'm sure Jean B can.  I still hate visiting the fucker, always scared he'll slip and fuck my mouth up but I believe in him. </br>  <br>thank you too</br>  Luffy's last name is Monkey.<br><br>His last move was called King Kong.<br><br>Is Luffy the monkey king?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I'm a worse person than you, because I'd nope the fuck away from a dentist that can't keep their hands steady, if they're doing anything with a handpiece.</br>  <br>I'm kind of sad we never got to see anything of Doffy's relationship with Dellinger.<br><br><br>Medication for parkinson stops the shaking. The most dangerous it could ever get is him falling asleep while he's working on you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a nod to Dragon Ball, not Journey to the West, because Oda loves Toriyama and Goku,</br>  But that reminds me of the dentist/professor in sim-lab who would instantly whip out of pocket knife if you asked him for help, and fuck up whatever project you were working on while saying he's helping. He would make a great pirate...<br><br><br> &gt;Medication for parkinson stops the shaking.  <br>Kinda depends how advanced their illness is, and how effective their medications are.</br></br></br></br>    <br>There's always fanart. I'm doubting the anime is going to put in any cute filler at this rate.</br>  <br>you're giving me new ships<br><br>stop immediately</br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br> implying new ships are bad </br>  <br><br> that image <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V09<wbr>7xuJWsBw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  WHERES THE LINK TO TODAYS EPISOOOOODE  <br><br><br>but I have enough rarepairs</br></br></br>  <br>who even is that</br>  <br><br>lol, what? gay dude's tripping for no reason, typical.</br></br>  <br>Last thread</br>  <br>Nah, too rare for me.</br>  <br>The guy in Kid's crew. I think his name is Heat?</br>  <br> who even is that </br>  <br>Fuck Toei. I totally though they'd expand on that. <br>What are they even planning to do once they catch up ? Frankly I'm starting to wonder if they aren't planning to stop the anime and switch to the OVA format for good. <br>And I certainly wouldn't mind it.</br></br></br>  Was Trebol being a Paramecia a retcon? It definitely LOOKS like he's being sliced into three here.  <br>care to post it ?</br>  <br>What took me so long to find this? Where has this been all this time? So fucking CUTE.</br>  <br>It ended anon<br>but if you want it to note it down for next week<br>http://www.ustream.tv/channel/galax<wbr>y9000</wbr></br></br></br>  can someone explain the deal with doffy's eyes? did they got shot out/scarred or something?  <br><br>Who was doing the cutting?</br></br>  <br>Usopp with his plants.</br>  <br>i don't think anyone knows, anon. maybe oda just wants to hide his face forever. or maybe it'll be something like Sanji's eye, which we eventually got to see after a long while.</br>  <br>you idiot, im talking about a working link to a subbed episode..watchop is down..omfg people these days</br>  <br>you kind of have to be looking for it to find it so its not surprising you've never seen it<br><br> but also im a loser who still digs janky MMDs<br/>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ste<wbr>2AMXUOng</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br>  <br> omfg people these days <br>Not him but fuck off.</br></br>  <br>I definitely wouldn't put it past Oda to explain it with some shit like this in an SBS.<br><br>Wouldn't really bother me at all either tbh</br></br></br>  <br>You mean when Whitebeard was almost dead with a hole in his chest and half his skull missing?</br>  Best  slut   <br>I do watch MMDs. LawLu MMDs are cute. I just drown in it. Searching for the Donquixote family didn't cross my mind. I should look for more. Thank you, anon!</br>  <br> thinks im a retard <br> uses tumblr </br></br>  <br> baww why aren't you spoonfeeding me </br>  <br>Fucking lewd.</br>  <br>Did you draw that just now?<br><br>Also, we still don't know Machvise's power.</br></br></br>  <br>nah, I think that picture first surfaced way back when we first saw Trebol's real body</br>  <br>not that person and you may not realize this but that pic you posted is from a tumblr photoset</br>  <br>The lewdest.</br>  Roci's name being deep as hell makes sense, Doffy's voice is also really fucking deep.<br><br>In fact, I never would have imagined Doffy's voice as deep as it is from the manga, and it took me a lot to get used to it. His casting reminds me of older anime.</br></br>  <br>I got this off 4chan, so im still not a tumblr retard</br>  <br>Doffy's animu voice bothers me because his laugh is different from the mango</br>  <br><br>Hehe he's right now that I pay attention to it.<br>Look at the top right of your pic. It's watermarked. Moreover I'm pretty sure tumblr's gif limit used to be 500KB.</br></br></br>  <br>refer to what I said here<br/></br>  <br> I got this off 4chan <br>yes, from a tumblr user<br><br>the lesson here being, you cant exactly call someone out for using tumblr images when you dont know what they look like yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>1 of 2 rebutting you.</br>  <br>no it's not. Doffy doesn't really have a unique laugh, "fufufu" is just a common laugh onomatopoeia. Robin's is the same for example.</br>  <br> i'm not a tumblr retard, I'm just ignorant <br>Whatever makes you sleep better at night.</br></br>  <br>2 of 2</br>  <br>ok, I was just making shitty excuses, but my point stands tumblr is a shithole</br>  <br> tumblr is a shithole <br>while that's true, so is 4chan. Non-imagedump boards specifically<br><br>it's kind of a pot/kettle thing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off bitch.<br><br>Anyone care to give me the one piece 703 sub link?</br></br></br>  Anyone else notice that Oda sometimes seems more interested in the world than the characters these days? Since the timeskip it feels like there's been an up kick in flashbacks related to things like the history and politics of the various islands and the pasts of side characters, and fights going to members of the supporting cast that would've gone to a Straw Hat in any other arc.<br><br>There were times in the current arc where I actually felt like the Straw Hats weren't the protagonists but just one of several equally important factions. I'm not sure I like this.</br></br>  <br>No, now fuck off.<br>If you can't find it by yourself, then you have nothing to do here.</br></br>  <br>I like the focus, but I also dislike that there's no focus on the straw hats. It's an exchange of sorts, the good overrides the bad, but I still wish we get more of the crew next arc.</br>  <br> Doffy doesn't really have a unique laugh, "fufufu" is just a common laugh onomatopoeia. Robin's is the same for example. <br>Do it's not you uncultured swine. Doffy's laugh is ffuffuffu, it has the sokuon while the generic onomatopoeia doesn't.</br></br>  <br>*No<br>Can't type tonight</br></br>  <br>https://www.google.co.uk/</br>  <br> .co.uk </br>  <br> since the time skip <br>Did the anime skip flashbacks, side stories, history and politics of the various islands and the pasts of side characters, because the manga has constantly had them pre skip too.</br></br>  <br> There were times in the current arc where I actually felt like the Straw Hats weren't the protagonists but just one of several equally important factions <br>That's exactly what they were though, it wasn't an impression. Law was, technically, the protagonist of this arc. He was the one who underwent the most conflict, he was the one who suffered the most, he was the one who got everything into motion because he was the one with the objective to kill Doffy and the motivation to do so in the first place. <br>Luffy by comparison ? He got his lunch from Rebecca. He was a side character. A side character who saved Law's ass and finished Doffy for good, but a side character none the less.</br></br></br>  <br> What are they even planning to do once they catch up <br>cant ever happen, they always go 1 chapter = 1 episode format. and sometimes, half a chapter to compensate for the oda breaks.</br></br>  <br>I said they seem to have increased, not that they weren't there. Skypiea in particular had a lot of that.</br>  <br>Yes it is, and i'm the faggot that posted that link</br>  <br>Yea I'm saying you're wrong though. There were more flashbacks per volume in the early story than the later.<br>Back then there was also more side story focus, though that's harder to count.</br></br>  <br>I'm going to miss him so much</br>  <br>why dont they just do a long filler arc ala bleach?<br><br>theres plenty of cover stories, even epecially important ones like jimbei's</br></br></br>  <br>Cover stories aren't THAT important though, after the characters reappear we get all the info necessary, in the end it's something to have fun weekly. Except for maybe the strawhat training ones before the timeskip.</br>  <br>Flamingo babies cute as fuck</br>  A previous iteration of this thread made me realize Hody was stronger than Lucci. I'm still kind of floored by that.  <br> Hody was stronger than Lucci <br>My brain refuses to accept this for some reason.</br></br>  Why Doffy's mom lost her blush in poverty?<br><br>Post Doffy mom.</br></br>  <br>My brain did for a while too, but the argument was since the pills supposedly double your power each time, Hody would have to be weaker than an ordinary civilian Fishman at base for his super form to be above Lucci.</br>  <br><br><br>He may have been stronger than PTS Lucci, but remember the guy isn't dead. Also, Doriki isn't really a good way to measure Lucci's strength, it only measured his physical strength as a human, no DF or Rokushiki power ups.</br></br></br>  <br> toei removed the scene where he was shirtless and bandaging himself up <br><br>Too lewd or do they just hate everything good</br></br></br>  <br>Not even in your dreams</br>  <br>Yeah, post-TS Lucci will certainly be stronger.<br><br>It just made me realize I'd been VASTLY underselling the timeskip gains.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>how could this have even possibly been in question<br><br>do you actually read this manga? in what world could lucci take anything that luffy threw against hody? lucci got rekt by a fucking jet gattling - no armament included</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was never in question that Hody was definitely tankier, but my thought was that since Lucci is faster and has a greater variety of techniques, he could pull a difficult win.</br>  <br><br> that since Lucci is faster <br><br>and where are you getting this from?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy defeated hody with his first attack jet stamp but he took steroids and recovered</br>  <br>its just hard to comprehend because of the different level of threat that each posed to luffy.<br><br>lucci was basically his equal at the time they were fighting and hody just got rekt. timeskip lucci would also likely wreck hody if his growth was anywhere near luffys</br></br></br>  <br>Lucci has Soru. Hody's just a big tank, but I'll admit he can throw water-bullets pretty well.</br>  Wait a sec...where is corazon post time skip?  <br><br>they arent talking about timeskip lucci - they are clearly talking about pre ts lucci<br><br>and it is fucking retarded to think that lucci would be anywhere near crackhead mode hody<br><br><br><br>the fight continued, stop talking about hodys strength as if it ended there - it does not matter how he got that strength - we are just talking about said strength compared to lucci<br><br>crackhead mode hody put up a fight against a timeskip luffy who trained with the first mate of gold roger - and tanked a good amount of his attacks AND broke his armament haki (which luffy admitted he needed to work on)<br><br>lucci fought a pre ts luffy and got out speeded by gear 2nd and out lasted<br><br>there is no comparison <br><br> b-but ts lucci... <br><br>no, that is not part of what those 2 idiots said</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What will happen to Bellamy?    <br>bones.</br>  <br>hopefully he'll make up with luffy and they'll go their seperate ways. but it kinda looks like he'll become the next nakama</br>  <br>Huh?<br><br>Post-timeskip, where is Donqixote Rocinante ?</br></br></br>  the episode showed one of doffy's eyes when he woke up<br><br>it was red</br></br>  Another weird fight I think about sometimes: post-TS Brook vs. pre-TS Jabra, the Tekkai expert. Could Brook break Tekkai? He did defeat a dragon whose skin was so tough that it ran face-first into a thick steel wall so hard the metal cracked, after all.  <br> a </br>  Threadly reminder that Sanji will die in a fascinating way.  <br> Throat cut by Anita Sarkeesian. </br>    <br>Marineford did something to Oda. The character interactions between the crew were fucking amazing in Sabaody, but in FI and PH they were pretty underwhelming. The part where they were going doing to FI was fun though.</br>  <br><br>wut u have to remember about brook is that his 'age' precedes rogers - hes literally the oldest pirate there is barring any other crazy df ability wank<br><br>he should have been able to shit on plenty of people way back then just because of his age factor in one piece power scaling <br><br>the issue is that he got turned into a sissyboy by moria and ryuuma abuse</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He was still powerful but not as powerful as when he attacked Shanks.</br></br>  <br>he's older than anyone sure, but he's basically fodder that aged. his one piece old age boost turned him from fodder into decent strength<br><br><br>plus one piece doesnt actually have an age boost, young WB would shit all over the marines but old whitebeard couldn't, maybe its the sickness though</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the body swapping shenanigans in Punk Hazard were fun.</br>   Dressrosa arc for 2 years <br> rocinante not seen the entire time <br>lmao oda you are a pos.<br>You could have atleast done rocinante,law and luffy vs doflamingo</br></br></br>  <br>he wasnt going all out against shanks. unless you think shanks has surpassed roger</br>   Law's flashback <br> one of the only opportunities where filler could work <br> Doffy and fucking Bellamy get more original scenes <br> they suddenly switch back to 1 chapter per episode pacing right as the flashback starts <br> it feels like it's going by even faster after fucking months of 10-12 pages per episode <br><br>Normally I can laugh at how bad Toei is but I'm genuinely sad now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You...you truly don't know</br>  <br>theyre making bellamy stand more so that when he joins the crew its more believeable. they got inside knowledge from oda that hes joining so they spend more time on him<br><br>oh god i felt dirty writing that I hope it doesnt happen</br></br></br>  <br>By that point in time Whitebeard was already weaker than his prime</br>  <br>he's obviously baiting  i hope </br>  <br>If this isn't bait, you're almost as retarded as the Rebecca fag<br>  almost  </br></br>  <br>Even though I agree, he was still strong enough that it's absurd that three all out attacks to Blackbeard didn't even phase him beyond crying whereas Akainu had to flee.</br>  <br>Hody couldn't keep up with g2 luffy either, and he didn't tank any of luffys hits he took steroids that would make anyone even fodder recover instantly. Lucci put up a fight and nearly won hody got his ass kicked all over noah</br>  <br>i mean, this is basically how their first meeting is gonna go</br>  <br>And still the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br>I'm an anime fag, but idc if u spoil it, why isnt he in the final fight?</br>  <br>Forgot pic.<br>Aces Fire Spears are very similar to a magma fist, anyone vulnerable to internal organ incineration should at minimum be defeated if directly hit by that unless they have a special first aid like Doffy. Just Crocodiles hook KOd Luffy.</br></br>    <br>hes dead, its already been said anyways. he is the younger brother that doffy kills.</br>  <br> theyre making bellamy stand more so that when he joins the crew its more believeable. <br>How dare you make me read that with my own two eyes</br></br>  Posting this I found through a previous thread<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cir<wbr>LmTzDldk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>The reason this was possible is Brooke is a casual swordsman and a master musician.</br>  <br> young WB would shit all over the marines <br><br>Garp, Sengoku and Zephyr (all three) could defeat prime WB.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh, no, Prime WB = Roger.</br>  <br>He was murdered in cold blood by Doflamingo for being a Marine informant.</br>  <br>You don't think 3 marine admirals could defeat Roger?</br>  <br>Oh, all at the same time, you mean? Not sure then.<br><br>Though 72-year-old, face-melted WB destroyed one Admiral.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but no they could not. Roger volunteered to be executed, don't forget.<br>At the end of One Piece Luffy might say about Smoker, "he cornered me many times" but all readers will know Luffy became overwhelmingly stronger as the story progressed.</br></br>  So /a/, post what your face would look like if, at the end of the series, another pirate crew beat the Straw Hats to the One Piece.    There are people that think Zoro can take Fujitora.    <br>I used to dislike the most recent One Piece op. It's grown on me and now I actually listen to it fully instead of skipping it.</br>  <br> MFW I realize some of those people are probably on this board </br>  <br>its hard to reason with the *insert character* fags. Just like that guy in the earlier thread who insisted kid would murder shanks. They don't listen when you tell them why theyre wrong</br>  <br>I'm honestly amazed at all the wank that came out of Zoro pushing Fujitora back a few feet.</br>  <br>me too, i'm kind of hoping Fujitora wrecks Zoro's shit at some point just to laugh</br>  <br>since fuji's a swordsman does that mean that mihawk is above admiral level?<br><br>since shanks is a swordsman does that mean he's stronger than a yonko</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>How would Fujitora defeat Zoro?<br>With gravity? Zoro broke out easier than Shichibukai Law.<br>With swordsmanship?<br>There are people on this board who believe Fujitora would defeat Mihawk trained Zoro in swordsmanship?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora openly admitted he was dangerous.<br>Fuji may also be a junior admiral in some capacity, and not as strong as Kizaru or Akainu, since his appointment was urgent.</br></br>  <br> 128287090 <br>just because he trained with him doesnt mean he reached his level of skill</br></br>  <br>Mihawk is, IMO, the best "only" swordsman.<br><br>Fuji and Shanks have other powers as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks and Mihawk only dueled back when Shanks was a rookie or mid-level.<br><br>Shanks gave up any hope of being best swordsman when he lost his arm.</br></br></br>  <br> Survive the very same attack Fujitora used against fodder <br> Would totally trash an admiral guys believe me <br><br>Some people, some people.</br></br></br></br>  What ever happened to that chef guy? Wasn't there like a cook or something?  I'm of the opinion that Magellan is likely above all the Warlords, since corralling them should they go rogue is probably in his job description.  <br> hyperbole the post <br>I didn't say Zoro would easily defeat Fujitora, I asked how Fuji would beat him. Your answer so far is "but he's a admiral" and it is shit.</br></br>    <br>that can't be true, magellan and shiryu were said to be equals, and shiryu is a swordsman, meaning mihawk is stronger than him.</br>  <br> calling it Blind Justice because he is blind </br>  <br>Gravity, swordsmanship, haki, etc. Admirals are complete fighters, if Fujitora couldn't fill the shoes of the likes of Kuzan and Akainu, they might as well just promote any random VA, anyone who can read the flow of the story know it's too early for Zoro to be on the same stage as an Admiral, if you want real factual evidence you're in the wrong place discussing the wrong subject.</br>  <br> hyperbole the post <br>If you're going to meme then do it correctly. You claim Zoro can take Fuji but your only reasoning is "because I say so" and it's shit.</br></br>  <br> Law <br> Fodder <br>Don't you remember how Law had to wait till Fujitora was distracted, to use his op as fuck DF to escape?<br>Zoro felt the gravity and made Fujitora release it by attacking him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> read the flow of the story <br>It is 3 months to revery. Zoro trained under Mihawk for a longer period of time than his entire journey and all his fights on Luffys crew.</br></br>  <br>Isn't Fujitora the first person to make Zoro bleed since the timeskip?</br>  <br>I'd lol if Mihawk's only been the best since Shiliew was locked up.</br>  <br>I believe he was referring to when Fujitora made a giant hole in the restaurant.</br>  <br>But Law didn't want to go head to head with an admiral. His goal was Doffy and the factory and shit. <br>If he fights and admiral, which he probably wouldn't win regardless, he'd be trying to go up against Doffy. And he'd lose for sure.</br></br>  <br>Magellan was explicitly stated to be stronger than Shiliew (how do you think he beat him and locked him up in the first place?)</br>  <br>I'm not sure how that attack was weaker than what was used on Law, seeing as the hole is a representation of the force of gravity used.<br>I'm also not understanding how Zoro easily countering it proves Fuji would defeat him.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, Magellan wouldn't be the one to capture the warlords. The warlords will be restrained with Sea Stone anyways.<br><br>Mihawk is the only person I'd say Magellan would have a tough time against otherwise, but if he's ever captured he wouldn't have his swords with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ZoroSmiling.png </br>  <br> pretending there are lower levels in one piece </br>  <br> Zoro trained under Mihawk <br><br>So? He's not Mihawk yet, and probably not even close (Blame DB and it's shonen logic of real fighting &gt; training) Vista got the seal of approval of Mihawk and even then he was hopeless against Akainu, Kizaru was having the upper hand against the Dark King with only swordsmanship, that speak tons on Fujitora who's main weapon seems to be a sword, and even then he still have gravity. Sure as hell Zoro is no easy feat for anyone after TS, but on the grand scheme of things there are still both, stronger people and stronger swordsmen.</br></br></br>  <br>I think he'd have a very tough time against Mihawk and Kuma, but defeat all the rest handily. Probably easily in the case of Moriah, who was the weakest.</br>  <br> that guy in the earlier thread who insisted kid would murder shanks <br><br>im positive that guy didnt give a shit about whether or not Kid could kill Shanks<br><br>Some people really do come here just to have someone to argue with</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The french guy? He left when he found himself a Suger Momma</br>  <br>She dumped him for Usopp though.</br>  <br> thinking I mean Violet </br>  <br><br><br>This is no DBZ, Shiryu presented the same treat as Magellan, but their fighting style is completely different, Magellan just needed to fill a room with poison for him to defeat Shiryu, and his ultimate poison made the use of swords quite useless too.</br></br></br>  <br>Zoro "easily" broke though the same attack Fujitora used on some shitter pirates in a restaurant. I'm not seeing how Zoro can match up to him yet. You bring up Law was just shitty reading skills since he isn't fodder.</br>  <br>Funny enough, Moria would have the upper hand against Magellan compared to Mihawk, I don't see how poison could affect Doppelman, while Mihawk touching Magellan would still infect the sword and then Mihawk body.</br>  <br>presumeably armament haki can counter magellans poison otherwise he literally has to touch you to win<br><br>still not as op as sugar's touch to win</br></br></br>  <br>Did you read the start of Zoro's training? He defeated Human drills which had copied Mihawk's sword style. Mihawk assumed he had lost.<br>Fuji is based but he will still have to fight Zoro if he follows orders.<br><br>It is stated by Mihawk's that he ALWAYS imbues his blades with haki.<br>This means that at Baraty, Mihawk only won because Zoro did not have haki, resulting in 2 of his 3 swords being broken. The human drills were a army of Mihawk level swordsman sans haki, it is why he accepted Zoro as his disciple.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Moriah is a hard character to quantify, really. He's explicitly the weakest Warlord (may or may not be counting Crocodile at that point, though), but he's mastered his Fruit to a degree not even many much stronger characters have.</br>  <br> shitty reading skills <br>Who has challenged Zoro as a swordsman post skip?<br>He immediately but Fujitora on the defensive.<br>Zoro is stronger than Law.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The human drills were a army of Mihawk level swordsman sans haki <br><br>don't do this to you anon</br></br></br>  <br>If that was the case than there'd easily have been plenty of jailbreaks from ID, moreover you'd think the escapees like Jinbe and Croco-boy wouldn't even need to run from Magellan and just 1-hit him.<br><br>Has Oda ever confirmed if BnH means you don't make contact? Like if Luffy grabbed Akainu's magma fist, would he still feel the heat?</br></br></br>  so why did crocodile save ace and luffy (from akainu)?<br><br>was it cause he was getting back into the pirate spirit of "fuck the marines" or was he grateful to luffy for getting him his groove back<br><br>Do you think oda has plans for croc considering he showed up in the newspaper cora was reading? oda stated he was a big time rookie and had the same dream as luffy when he was younger, but then the defeat to WB crushed him. <br><br>He presumeably got a strength boost at marineford (fighting doffy, akainu, jozu, mihawk, alabasta luffy could not do that) because he got his "ambition" back. SInce he follows his dream again he is stronger</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The monkey imitating Mihawk was only in the anime, anyway.</br>  <br>Oh, Alabasta Croc was definitely way stronger than Alabasta Luffy.<br><br>Luffy attacked his weak point for massive damage.</br></br></br>  <br>I kinda hope but it would still be a stretch of what CoC truly is, an armor, and even in full armor you still have a human body beneath, Law stated there's simply no way to protect your body from the inside, so Magellan poison might as well be still a treat to Haki users.</br>  <br>Does anyone else feel like there's going to be tension within the SH crew? I really feel like Zoro has put in zero to no effort in every major fight thus far (while Luffy's gone balls to the wall) only for this to be a major point in the future. Regardless of what power-up Luffy is always hiding, it still stands that Luffy has gotten much more injured and collapsed after each fight (like Hody and Doffy), while Zoro is clearly fine each time. <br>Can we really expect to go for the entire latter half of One Piece without having any drama between the Straw Hats, like the whole deal with Usopp, Robin, even Nami way early on? And I'm not talking about potential future crew, I mean current crew (despite the whole "train for my captain!!" timeskip resolve).</br></br>  <br> Zoro is stronger than Law <br><br>pls stop</br></br></br>    <br> moving the goalpost from "real fighting." Look how Rayleigh trained Luffy. King Kong Punch in Gear 4 was needed to defeat the animals on the island he trained on. It was strong enough to KO Doffy. </br>  <br>Are you implying Zoro's ALREADY beaten Mihawk?<br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!</br></br></br>    <br>One Piece Episode 702 - Nothing Happens</br>  <br>Just let him be, he believe anyone with sword is automatically below Zoro, I don't blame him thou, this is Oda's fault for spoon feeding Zoro since the TS.</br>  <br>I actually consider Pica a pretty difficult fight. Zoro had to ask for help, not once but twice.</br>  <br>one piece timeskip in a nutshell</br>  <br>I think any dissention will be coming from the new members. Which is maybe why Oda is introducing them at all<br><br>I doubt anyone current will have Usopp level issues at this point. Robin's already done, Franky has never had issues to begin with and Brook has already given himself to Luffy.<br><br>I can't imagine anyone earlier having something to get worked up over. With new member, we get the chance for clashes. Zoro with Kin'emon for obvious reasons, Jinbe with Nami(and therefore Sanji), Momonosuke with Luffy because D vs. 'celestial dragon' lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>now don't kid yourself, you may be a hardcore zorofag but you are right about some things, pica was an easy fight, the only "hard" part was transportation</br>  <br>Do you just make shit up to argue? I implied that Mihawk was capable of training Zoro up to fight an Admiral in 2 years if Zoro was capable of cutting steel 2 months into his pirate journey with only memories of a sensei.<br>Zoro won't lose a sword fight against anyone but Mihawk or above.</br></br>  <br>Chopper and Robin still haven't had their "Xth Person" chapters yet, just to note.<br><br>I speculate Chopper will get an offer from Kaido's crew as a powerful Zoan, and Robin will consider becoming a full-time Revolutionary.</br></br></br>  <br> therefore with sanji  <br><br>fucking whiteknight</br></br></br>  <br>he wont lose, WHEN HE ACTUALLY FIGHTS THEM<br><br>right now zoro would lose to fuji in an all out fight, which is why they wont have an all out fight, skirmishes at best.</br></br></br>  A side character has never deserved to win more than this girl.  Think they gonna get Nobunaga Shimazaki to voiced this guy?  <br> meido outfit <br>My dick.</br></br>  <br>She injured his leg when they were 4 trying to impress Akane. She's also mad jelly about Satou.</br>  <br> when they were 4 trying to impress Akane <br>More like "when she was jelly about Akane liking Shuu more and wanted to impress Akane."</br></br>  <br>This artist is so damn good at making delicious girls. Especially delicious twintail girls.</br>   /a/ still discusses Fateshit non-stop even when there's nothing related airing <br><br>Fucking why.</br></br>   /a/ is discussing anime <br><br>I know, THE HORROR!</br></br>  If you think that's bad, you should see the Yahari threads.  I remember the time when people wouldnt shut up about Tsukihime.   miuna monday is still a thing <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with these people?</br></br>  <br>of course they would<br><br>VNs belong on /jp/ after all</br></br></br>  <br>Because /a/ has been talking about TM non-stop for as long as /a/ has been around.</br>  We should make more Non Non Biyori threads instead  <br> what if x happened instead of y <br> why didn't x just do this? <br> what if x master had y servant? </br></br></br>  <br><br>4chan is like a chatroom to them. It's all the same people, every thread. Terrible.</br></br>  There's always something new happening with the fate franchise, they just won't stop milking it. It's HXH threads you should be complaining about.  <br>as expected from prison school fags who joined the board yesterday.</br>  <br> What is manga <br>Not even the OP, but are you even trying?</br></br>  <br>Why haven't mods banned that shit yet then?</br>  <br><br>Soon. <br><br>https://archive.moe/tv/thread/58657<wbr>835/#58657873</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>What, do you want me to "discuss" Umaru-chan or some shit?</br>  They are still better than Evafags to be honest, walking into one of those threads is like having a tour of Tumblr.  <br>Because the mods post in, and babysit, the threads.<br><br><br>There was a similar post on /a/ a while back. Nothing happened. Mods just circlejerk their shit threads and make a false flag public ban rec thread every week so retards fellate them and think they're doing something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari threads are fucking disgustin yet I don't see you crying about them fuckface.<br>At least fatefags ran out of things after a decade, Yaharifags have been here for a couple months and they already repeat the same posts every thread.</br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/_/search/capcod<wbr>e/mod/<br><br> this retard who bans random generals and forgets 2 days later <br><br>worst was when wixoss got banned while it was airing</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Monstergirls and homu threads are back.</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br> At least fatefags ran out of things after a decade, <br>Not even, it's more that every thread get targeted by shitposters so nobody that actually likes Fate is creating or participating in threads regularly.</br></br>  <br> OP wants /a/ only to discuss currently airing shit <br> people still wonder why their old anime isn't discussed here </br></br>  <br><br>There's a difference between good, occasional discussion about old anime and the generalshit we currently have.</br></br>  <br>It's what they get for convincing every newfag they have to read the VN or bitch about english only primaries.<br><br>Well, now everyone read the VN, it was shit, and we're making good on that investment by participating in the cheap shitposting or dank maymays they invented last decade. They have themselves to blame.</br></br></br>  Yuru Yuri threads right now are pretty bad. It's essentially a general in all but name. Atleast Fate fags have a different OP text for their threads.  <br> TALK ABOUT MORE ANIME <br> NICE ANIME THREAD OP <br> WHAT ANIME IS THIS ABOUT <br><br> AHHH GENERALFAGS WHY DO YOU KEEP MAKING GENERALS <br><br>I blame moot and mods for this mentality mostly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   /a/ still discusses shit like oreimo that is below average at best   <br> Justifying shitposting <br>You are cancer and the world would be better if you killed yourself.</br></br>  <br>It's just my assumption, but I think fatefags are mostly just edgelords on the opposite end of the spectrum from moefags. Both are cancerous as fuck, but don't seem to realize it.</br>  <br><br>No one gives a shit about LOGH discussion every couple of days, it's when you have 24/7 threads like Yaharifags that it's a problem.</br></br>  I want to put a finger inside the girl in the OP image.  <br>TMfags are not on a spectrum, or if they are they are kind of on the middle. There are too many who jerk off to their sabah or their rin or their akiha or their ilya.</br>  Forget about powerlevels and decade old visual novels, I can't even stand being in airing anime threads a day or two after the episode aired.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> &gt;&gt;&gt; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not going to stop. All it takes is one faggot to start a thread.</br></br>  <br>I don't get how this particular anime is so popular.<br><br>It gets 400 replies 300 images omitted all the time, and for the longest time perpetual oreimo threads.<br><br>All to discuss literally the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  Ever since mods started encouraging Naruto threads /a/ has really let itself go and it introduced a new breed of general posters who only care about one show and have no interest in ever doing anything else.  List of shit that needs to be purged from the board but the mods are too much of pussy fags to actually do it:<br><br>Jojo generals<br>HxH generals<br>Yuru Yuri generals<br>Yuyushiki generals<br>Madoka tripfag circlejerks<br>Hibike generals<br>Yahari generals<br>Fujoshit circlejerks<br>Miuna Monday<br><br>Why the fuck can't all fanbases of popular stuff be as well behaved as Monogatari or EVA fans are about this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Monogatari </br>  <br>Yahari is just too much of a good bait for shitposters<br>Like you have everything right there just waiting to be taken</br></br>  <br>They don't have a general. Only occasional threads focusing on a specific topic most of the time. Same thing with EVA. Everyone should follow their examples.</br>  <br>the moment they start going all out, IRC crews will start leaking shit like names and chat rooms<br>its a bloody power play of neets and fatties</br></br>  <br>OreImo is as integral to /a/ as Evangelion. Prove me wrong.</br>  <br><br>kinda always the case really<br><br>people keep trying to get /a/nons to expand their horizons but they are usually "hurr moeshit durr edgy herpderp anime is shit"<br><br>under that train of thought is it really surprising that people only stick to the anime they know?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I try to report every Yahari general I find but mods don't give a fuck.<br><br>Naruto threads are better than Yahari, Yahari is full of tumblr and reddit. And they have no fucking shame of admitting they are from tumblr and reddit</br></br></br>  <br>/a/ doesn't even like Oreimo (worst girl won after all). <br><br>they don't like Eva either but Eva is integral to anime period, not just /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Mods did delete one of the yahari generals <br>10, and i shit you not, 10 threads popped in less of 50 seconds.</br></br>  <br>Also, forgot about that "Idle Activities" shit and Love Live.</br>  <br> light novels go on /jp/ <br>I thought they could be discussed here if they have an anime/manga adaptation.</br></br>  <br>HAHAHAHA. YOU'LL NEVER BE FREE FROM FATE THREADS.</br>  <br> Monogatari or EVA fans <br><br>I like Type moon and jojo better.</br></br></br>  <br>that's usually what happens when you delete generals.<br><br>deleting a general is like popping a pimple.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  50 bucks we get /ag/ in less of a year<br>Do it rapeape, i know you are reading this you sjw fuck</br>  <br>Aikatsu is constantly getting new episodes, also is a catch all for other little girl shows. Not really comparable to love live which is more starved for discussion. Ironically aikatsu people are less elitist than other popular shit even thiugh they have more of a right to for a 100+ episode show.</br>  <br>It's not like deleting a thread gets them tired.<br><br>If they delete one and 10 pop out then delete those 10. <br>It will be little while but threads will start disappearing.<br><br>Mods just don't give a fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Apparently, the reason was that it was NSFW. A later thread with that picture but cropped showed up and didn't get deleted.</br></br>  <br> &gt;/a/ still discusses Fateshit non-stop even when there's nothing related airing <br>Fate currently has 2 manga series and 2 LN series with new chapters and volumes being released every couple of months or so and with translations of all four projects coming all the time. There is plenty of new content to discuss.</br></br>  <br>Ya you're either new or retarded. <br>There's a site that EVA fags are from and it sure as shit isn't tumblr.</br></br>  <br>You can't say rapeape, troid or redwood without being caller a gamercancer fuckhead these days.</br>  <br>why not?<br>/a/ is /v/ anyway<br><br>I mean we even got threads like these</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a part of any of these generals, hell I rarely ever post anymore, but what's the issue people have with them? It seems like a good idea to keep all talk in a single thread as opposed to possibly numerous threads.</br>  <br>there's more than that anon, a number of blacklisted tripfags have been doing wet work on high profile animes so the fanbase gets shit on.<br><br>Fuck em too, all bark no bite</br></br></br>  <br>evageeks is basically tumblr<br><br><br>And does /a/ discuss them?<br><br>average fate thread<br><br> shirou is the red man <br> what would {x servant} {class} look like <br> rin so kawaii <br> unlimited jets </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> generals are good <br>fucking kike</br></br>   people discussing fateshit should be banned  <br> pre-2000 manga/anime discussion is allowed </br>  <br> but what's the issue people have with them? It seems like a good idea to keep all talk in a single thread as opposed to possibly numerous threads. <br>Because moot and rapeape call them cancer, so you're supposed to hate generals and call them cancer, even though the moderation is what encourages them anyway<br><br>There's really nothing inherently wrong with generals unless it's a a yahari/love live situation where you've dried up new content to discuss. For the most part it's just shit mods claim to care about for support like a politician saying he'll cut middle class taxes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Plenty of people complain about Redwood without /v/edditors calling them GGers</br>  <br> And does /a/ discuss them? <br>maybe they start out that way, but they don't stay that way for long. There's a fate thread in the catologue right now that started out about homolusting over Lancer and quickly became about the Fate/Strange Fake manga and LN and the recent translations for both. <br>Also I just realized that there are actually three Fate LNs coming out if you count Lord El-Melloi II Case Files.</br></br></br>  /vg/ was made to contain cancer, and it worked<br>/a/ could use the same treatment.</br>  <br>As an ex HxH fan, any mention of that show makes me angry. I don't hate it, I just hate Togashi.</br>  <br>No it isn't. <br>Generals drive down the over all quality of the board by bring in low quality posters who dilute the good content with fucking shitty ass repetitive threads with barely any effort put forth. <br>Threads that are inherently decreasing the over all content of the board should be removed for the sake of the community and if you don't give a fuck about the community here then honestly we don't fucking want you around. <br>Naruto is toxic and it is killing this board and if we all just sit around it's going to take it from us. <br>Balls in our court boys.<br>The staff's hands are either tied or they are refusing to do anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you looked at Eva threads recently? Nothing but page long tl;dr bickerings to defend the integrity of their favorite characters, all of which reads like somebody insulted their mother. Tell me with a straight face that's not tmblr.</br>  <br>But /vg/ is way better than /v/ in every sense, /v/ is shitposting general all the way down and tumblr reigns over there.<br><br>I mean jesus christ there's people telling they're from tumblr in that place. Also they're all a bunch of underage faggots and newfag enablers</br></br></br>  Why do you guys even care anyway?<br><br>you don't like the anime/manga that the generals are about nor do you like them talking about said anime so having them squared away in one general should be a good thing for you. <br><br>If you autistic fucks had your way there would be even less anime/manga talked about on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/vg/ seems pretty decent if you actually care about video games<br><br>/m/ is basically an /ag/ for mecha toku stuff, and for most stuff it doesnt seem to have a negative impact that it has a lot of general threads</br></br></br>   Yahari this yahari that. <br><br>Blimey,last time i saw one of those threads, they only had a dude translating the LN and died out peacefully.</br></br>  <br>/vg/ is IRC-tier circlejerking.</br>  ITT: /v/ermin that don't want anime on the fucking anime board.  <br>Because lazy uncreative people who are just going to squat and repost the same god damn content are not welcome here. <br>Take it to one of the many shit forums if that's what you're looking for.</br></br>  <br> low quality posters <br>Define low quality<br> good content <br>Define good<br><br> we don't fucking want you around <br> speaking on behalf of everyone as if all of /a/ are liked minded </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>vg is decent.<br><br>Try and make a thread about something(that's not nintendo related) on /v/ you'll get shitposted to death, i've been checking. <br>In /vg/ I see people actually discussing the shit they like with people that like it, no shitposting</br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto is toxic and it is killing this board and if we all just sit around it's going to take it from us <br>/thread</br></br>  <br> Generals drive down the over all quality of the board by bring in low quality posters who dilute the good content with fucking shitty ass repetitive threads with barely any effort put forth.  <br>I don't see any evidence of that, the famous generals have a bad rep because they are cancer, but for the rest of them are just normal threads more highly organized. I see absolutely difference between having 3 shitty meme threads while UBW aired instead of one single /fate/ general.<br><br> Threads that are inherently decreasing the over all content of the board should be removed for the sake of the community and if you don't give a fuck about the community here then honestly we don't fucking want you around <br>That is true, but as I will explain the current policies encouraged this situation.<br><br> The staff's hands are either tied or they are refusing to do anything. <br>They have an agenda to keep the general stuff in place <br><br>Imagine if you had another code geass show today, it wouldn't exist since mods would only see "shitposting" and delete them to keep in one thread. Yet the next week they'll ban another show for general threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto is toxic <br><br>Are you dumb? There's 1 Naruto thread when new content comes out(anime or movie spoilers). <br><br>Stop parroting shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hows about you leave the board since you don't even want to talk about anime.<br><br>Why the hell are you here anyway. Just to bad mouth other anime fans and discourage anime threads from even being made?</br></br></br>  <br>/vg/ is pure shitposting. I used to post in Arcsys general and that was shitposting 24/7</br>  <br>It's still important to /a/ though. We get threads all the time asking about the ending much the same way as Eva.</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  I like to blame the whole "doing ironically" mentality myself.  <br>Do you see the fucking autist that shit posts on ghost and in every thread and the reposted threads that happen when a shit thread gets deleted. These people are dictating how this board is run, do you agree that that much power should lie with a single group of users? Why is it fair to protect these people from the community that would eat them whole if the mods weren't standing between us and them?</br>  <br>Explain then. <br><br>Check how many Naruto threads are in the catalogue. <br>Check how many Fate thread are there.<br>Check the quality of Yahari generals that are on 24/7</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't play video games, but it seemed like /vg/ didn't have a culture of its own, there could be threads with high quality content or other threads that are pure shit.<br><br>this is similar to  point about negative effects on the community but it seems to work fine besides that</br></br></br>  <br>A number of semi dead generals are decent<br>ddg and armored core general comes to mind.<br>Now if you go for the shitpost central that are lolgen and dotagen, then yeah.</br></br></br>  Why is this thread still up? Why hasn't /v/ left?<br>I'm not defending generalshit but metathreads are just as bad.</br>  <br>The fuck are you quoting me for? That has nothing to do with Niggywood and his buttbuddies.</br>  Why do you guys hate reddit and tumblr so much anyway?<br><br>They are just other websites that both discuss anime and yes it is okay to have a facebook too.<br><br>Go to   if you are afraid of the feminists watching you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get out</br>  <br><br>Look at /tv/, something that is literally Reddit: the board, and tell me why I shouldn't hate it.</br></br>  <br>tumblr is /pol/ but on the other end of the spectrum.<br><br>don't know about reddit</br></br></br>  <br>back to the gas chamber with you</br>  <br>I think you made a wrong turn at reddit, you were supposed to go to gaia.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I watched a general for a game I used to love succumb to shitposting to the point where nobody even bothers making threads anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw gaia is dead and all its users flooded to /a/ </br>  All you have to do to realize how bad generals are, go to /vg/ and spend the day in the star craft thread.  <br>Because I HAVE THE RIGHT TO TALK AND THE FREEDOM TO DEAL WITH THE<br>CONSEQUENCES</br></br>  <br>He likely can't handle the naruto banter. It's anime and he doesn't understand why it isn't liked.</br>  <br>Or the Katawa Shitjou and Mass Effect generals</br>  <br>sc is dead, go to lolgen if you want the real deal<br><br>Hotline miami?<br>Drakenguard 3?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hotline miami? <br> Drakenguard 3? <br>A weeaboo MMORPG published by Nexon that you probably haven't heard of.</br></br></br>  <br>These will do as well. <br>bit the bullet and delete /vg/ and then ban them when they flood back to /v/ and we might come out of this as a site better than before. This will never happen though.</br></br>  <br> waiting /cog/ , /ag/ for years <br> still nothing <br> /v/ get another fucking board for retro <br>there's no justice in this world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those the multiple Fate threads are the alternative to generals<br><br> Want to make a thread for all discussions of a certain anime  <br> waahhh GENERALS ARE SHIT DON'T MAKE THEM <br> Make threads of each discussion  <br> WAAAAHHH THERE'S TOO MANY THREADS KEEP IT IN ONE THREAD <br><br>the only other option is to stop discussing the anime altogether which is why your criticism always come off as "stop liking what I don't like!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>meg is deader than evils</br>  <br>You're not getting /ag/. <br>I know it for a fact. <br>A FACT. <br>I can't elaborate more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mass Effect generals <br>I used that as a support group when mass effect 3 sucked, little while later and I was on the korra train as well.<br><br>It was those experiences that taught me to never expect anything to be good again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Spill the beans jannyman, i know it has to do with the deal the mods broke with Crunchyroll and fakku</br>  <br>Sssssss $s</br>  <br>Oreimo has BLOOD RELATED incest.<br><br>That's a rarity in anime nowadays. The characters are also much more human that your average harem anime.</br></br></br>  I've just finished PMMM anime. Is it worth watching the 1st and 2nd movies or I can skip straight to the 3rd one?  None of it is worth watching, should have skipped PMMM in its entirety.  <br>series is god tier<br>movies just shit on it<br>stop now while you're ahead</br></br></br>  <br>Movies 1 and 2 are recaps. Skip to 3.</br>  <br><br> shitting on PMMM or Rebellion <br>Did you know that you're more mainstream than mainstream when you do this?</br></br></br>  <br>Third movie is shitty fanfiction, don't bother.</br>  <br>Don't watch any of the movies. The series is fine by itself, you'll just be wasting your time.</br>  Third movie is the best part of the series, proceed  <br>The first two movies are literally just a compilation of the entire TV series so no, you don't have to watch them.</br>  <br>this</br>   Rebellion is hated on Reddit <br> Rebellion is loved on MAL <br><br>Oh no, what are /a/ hipsters to do?</br></br></br>  <br>Skip straight to the 3rd one.</br>  <br>Ignore what ridiculous Rebellion haters say.<br><br>Rebellion is the TV series' sequel respectively. Proceed.</br></br></br>  <br>rebellion is visually so spectacular that it would be remiss not to watch it.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6P4<wbr>9pNzDiq0</wbr>  [ ]<br>It sure is.</br></br>  <br>It's worth watching it all.</br>  <br>more like it's a clusterfuck of meaningless visuals</br>  <br>Not rhe same anon, but you can't seriously think that right? This isn't like eva, where the Christianity just was shoved in, each and every piece of symbolism in rebellion is relevant to the story. I didn't like the story, but the symbolism was on fucking point.</br>  <br>Who told you it was alright to skip parts?</br>  <br> Being this dense <br>I didn't like the movie either but most of the visuals are very direct and easy to understand symbolism.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Agree with these guys. The series was ended perfectly, there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back.<br><br>And don't give me that meaningless "H-Homura's character development! She was left sad!!!" that's just the outcome of the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched up to mami's death and dropped it. Figured there was no point watching it knowing her theme song would never play again</br>  <br>It does play again though.</br>  <br><br>And Mami's theme isn't the only one that is amazing.</br></br>  <br> there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back. <br>If there's a story that can be told, that is enough reason. There's no actual logical basis to rejecting a sequel just for being a sequel. <br><br>And there's no such thing as a 'perfect ending'. Nothing is above re-examination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty though.</br>  <br>The true answer is you can ski straight. But I would rather give it time and watch the movies later.</br>  <br>This. Based Homura. Leave now before more smoilers.</br>  <br>Don't watch the Rebellion Story. Read the Different Story instead.</br>  <br>You can skip the first two movies. But don't skip straight to the third movie. Give it a week or so.</br>  <br> yandere Mami <br>Kowaii</br></br>  <br>It's Candeloro talking.</br>  <br>The movie didn't have to be as shitty as it was. Felt they only had like 45 minutes worth of plot and needed to stretch it out somehow.<br><br>I prefer the manga version of Rebellion since it doesn't feel as flabby with filler.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally implode</br>  <br>Candeloro is just Mami after she's given up all hope.</br>  <br>Are the manga canon?</br>  <br>Well, you shouldn't consider anything beyond series and movies to be canon. Manga are done by Hanokage and not by Gen.</br>  <br>Yes, except when they aren't. <br><br>Different Story is canon while Homura's Revenge isn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Yen Press released Homura's Revenge already?</br>  <br> different story is canon <br>As far as I would like, as long as there's no word from the creator of the original series, it cannot be considered canon.</br></br>  <br>What is this</br>  <br>It adapts a canon Drama CD and explicitly takes place in an alternate timeline from episode 10. It's canon enough and a good read. <br><br>Yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>The Butcher is part of the Magica Quartet, right? So if a manga says 'story by Magica Quartet' would it be considered canon?</br>   hurr canon <br>Who gives a shit, I hate you people, fuck you and the horses you respectively rode in on.</br>  <br>Fanfiction where Homura gets her revenge</br>  <br>upon whom</br>  <br>Kyubey.</br>  <br>What, again?</br>  <br>Yes. The only manga that's worse is Homura Tamura.<br><br> The life of a magical girl isn’t all fighting witches and collecting grief seeds. When they aren’t kicking butt, Homura Akemi and her friends face the same trials as normal high school girls! In this four-panel comedy, glimpse a sillier side of the girls from the bestselling Puella Magi Madoka Magica series! </br></br></br>  I Just Watched the Third Movie today and I hated it ¬¬, the anime is good itself, you don,t need the movies  <br>Why is it bad? The revenge one I mean.</br>  <br>The worst part of the movies is the replacement BG in the morning sequence. The plates clearly have cherry tomatoes on them but the BG in the movies has these big beefsteak monsters on the same vine. I can't believe someone said "We had to rush these out the first time, let's do this right and fuck up the tomatoes."</br>  <br> glimpse a sillier side of the girls from the bestselling Puella Magi Madoka Magica series! <br>They just don't give a shit anymore, do they?</br></br>  <br>The characters just feel like caricatures of themselves. Worse than the way Rebellion fucked up Kyoko and Mami. <br><br>The actual plot of the manga is that Homura and Madoka remember the end of the TV series and decide to stop any tragedies from happening. The main conflict is that Kyubey also remembers and needs bitches to become witches.</br></br></br>  <br> Not having your own opinions <br> Not knowing Rebellion is   shit <br> Only yuri fags and homu lovers could enjoy the absolute trash that is rebellion.  </br></br></br>  <br>Suzune Magica is canon.</br>  <br>how<br>does<br>her<br>spine<br>work</br></br></br></br></br>  This is all you need to know about rebellion, if you liked this; you'll like rebellion, if you didn't you won't.      <br>It's magic.</br>  <br>spooky</br>  Good bye everyone.    <br>Sayaka-chaaaaan</br>  Half of Rebellion PN scanned. <br><br>Bored out of my mind.</br></br>  <br> Worse than the way Rebellion fucked up Kyoko and Mami.  <br>Except there was nothing wrong with Mami and Kyouko. We already know that Mami's weakness came about because she was desperate not to be alone, and in Rebellion's dream world Mami has an artificial past of having been with Bebe for longer than she can remember, and having formed a team with the others. She has no reason to lose her head, in any sense of the phrase. Kyouko doesn't discuss her past but it's fair to assume that she has fake, saccharine memories like Mami up until her scenes with Homura cause her to remember her real past, and even then you have to remember that this Kyouko already had her conflict and resolution with Sayaka off-screen, before the events of the series ending. <br><br>Rebellion's characterization of the two is spot-on. <br> b-but muh despair! <br>It's like you didn't even watch the series ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Reddit</br>    <br> cause her to remember her real past <br>Did this even happen? The only other shown to recall something on her own was Mam, which presumably was followed by Nagisa dumping all the info on them as they got together to face Homulily.</br></br>  <br>Probably not entirely. Bits and pieces? This scene seems to show a Kyouko who remembers enough death in her life to be rather fed up with losing people close to her, and after this Kyouko seems more jaded and in line with her former self—her (lack of) reaction to Kyubey speaking sticks out to me.</br>      <br/>      What is the relationship between Mami and Bebe at the end of the movie? Were Bebe still living with Mami?  <br>Oriko Magica and The Different Story are definitely canon and also not shit. They also have stories that star the anime cast but focus more on Mami and Kyoko. <br> They take place in alternate timelines that Homura visited. <br><br>Madoka Magica the manga is a retelling of the series that's interesting but only crazy fans will care about it. The Rebellion Story manga can be found online and its much better than the movie that its based off of. <br><br>Kazumi Magica, Tart Magica, and Suzune Magica are side stories that don't really contradict the canon of the anime. Tart Magica is probably the best of the three. <br><br>Homura's Revenge and Homura Tamura are non-canon and are just fanservice for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> PMMM <br>It's like I'm actually on tumblr.<br><br><br>The term canon means what is true within a fictional setting. And the only way you can prove something is true is to support it with facts. There is nothing in the main story (e.g. The movies or anime) that supports the events that took place in TDS. Thus you have no proof to support the fact the events from TDS are true in the same fictional setting as the anime/movies. You can Google the word canon to confirm the definition. Canon is about story narrative, which is why stories that don't connect in some way are not part of the same canon, and why everything is canon to itself. Also, just sharing characters and location is not enough to "connect" them, because in that case fan work would be canon as well.<br><br>If you want examples of series where side content is canon look at Nanoha or Raildex. Both of those stories have events that happened in side content referenced in the main setting.<br><br>Also note that TDS or the CD drama it's based on was not written by Gen, but Masaki Hiramatsu. A person who is not on the anime production staff.<br>http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Masaki_<wbr>Hiramatsu<br><br><br><br> if I like it it's canon <br>Do you keep realize how you never actually say why it's canon you just keep stating it?</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa no longer henshin into Bebe. Nagisa is now Mami's daughter.</br>  <br>What about battle pentagram   it's all homura's dream  </br>  <br> if I like it it's canon <br>Works for me. It's not like this is /co/ where comics have defined canons.</br></br>  <br>We don't exactly know her relationship with Nagisa is but Nagisa's definitely her loli.</br>  <br>I'm really happy today because Rifyu is back. He posted a Umaru~n comic on pixiv.</br>   <br>Let me restate that Kazumi, Tart, and Suzune don't directly contradict the anime's canon but aren't tied to its plot either. <br><br>The Different Story and Oriko do take place in different timelines thanks to Homura shenanigans. <br><br>Madoka and Rebellion manga are a retelling of the events that occurred in the anime and movie. <br><br>Homura's Revenge and Homura Tamura are fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is wrong with you? Apply the definition of canon to the events of Battle Pentagram and see if it comes out canon. You should be able to save this on your own.<br><br><br>I hope you realize I was making fun of you.<br>I don't know what you think canon is, but you clearly wrong. Because you seem think it's just something to shitpost about. What's canon is used when answering questions related to the series. The point of knowing what's canon is so that if a question arrives you use relevant information to answer it. Not something unrelated. Like trying to answer a question about the Book of Revelations with something that happened in Genesis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oriko did nothing wrong!</br>  <br>You're right. You sure did restate it. But you didn't add anything new or relevant.<br><br> don't directly contradict the anime's canon <br>You keep saying this like it's relevant. Did you even read what I wrong or good the word canon itself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Oriko and Different Story and so they're canon to me. Seems simple enough. Thanks anon. <br><br>You shouldn't have your panties in a bunch about what is part of the one true canon though.</br></br></br>  <br> so they're canon to me <br>It's like you can't even read.<br>What's the point of coming to a discussion board if you're not actually here to discuss anything, and only here to endless spew what you think (but can't prove) and then hope people praise you.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't think it's relevant when it comes to talking about the canon of fiction if stories set in the world directly contradict the source material or not? Please explain yourself.</br>  <br>Hope nobody else is foolish enough to actually think this is true.</br>  <br>You're discussing even less. Instead of talking about which of the manga you enjoy, you instead need 'proof' of what canonical for some reason. Seems like you have a one track mind.</br>  <br>God damn, I hate you retards. You didn't even read what is the very first post I made.<br>Something JUST not contradicting doesn't make it canon, because by that logic near everything is canon.</br></br>  <br>Not contradicting canon of the anime and being set in the same world as the anime make the manga canon enough.</br>  <br> Instead of talking about which of the manga you enjoy <br>No, you fucking idiot. Jesus, go back to tumblr. No one gives a shit what you like. You are here to discuss the series itself, you are not here to talk about what you like. This is not your blog.<br><br> for some reason <br>READ the posts in front of you. ALL the way through.<br>I already explained why you need to know what's canon. So when having discussion about the topic you answer with relevant information.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Madoka Magica the manga is a retelling of the series that's interesting but only crazy fans will care about it. The Rebellion Story manga can be found online and its much better than the movie that its based off of. <br><br> Hope nobody else is foolish enough to actually think this is true. <br><br>Yeah, same here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to ask. Are you legitimately brain dead? No, honest question. Because what you said was already specifically addressed.<br><br>For the good of the Earth, just kill yourself. You are clearly not smart enough to ever contribute anything of worth.</br></br></br>  <br> I already explained why you need to know what's canon <br>Okay, say why you NEED to what's canon again in seven words or less.</br></br>  <br>So you don't answer with irrelevant information.</br>  <br>You should calm down. That's just how canon works when it comes to anime and spin off manga. Your lack of powerlevel is showing.</br>  <br>I mostly agree with you. And just one question. Is Rebellion canon with your opinion? <br><br>There is nothing in the main story (TVA) that supports the events that took place in Rebellion. Just like TDS, the plot of Rebellion is one possible way that doesn't contradict to the setting of TVA.<br><br>You know who the creators were not important in the definition of canon right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> your wrong because I say so <br> this is how it works because I say so <br>Again, the Earth is bad enough as it is. Do your part to clean it up. Think of the children.</br></br></br>  <br>That is seven words or less. Guess there's just nothing to discuss with a dumbass like you.</br>  <br>You have yet to prove me wrong.</br>  <br>Coming from the retard who can't even read.</br>  <br><br>samefag.</br></br>  <br> you didn't prove me wrong because I say so! <br>I recommend just over dosing on something. It's painless that way.<br><br>Because you are honestly stupid enough to think saying nothing other than "UR WRONG" proves you right. You didn't even address what I said in the first post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Insults are the crutch of the ignorant. And you're boring.</br>  <br><br>Mami is a mediocre character, every medium; I have enjoyable time reading Kyoko backstory.<br>But dropped Mami story because she´s extreme optimistic</br></br></br>  <br> blatantly claiming something is canon just because. <br><br>I want tumblr to leave.</br></br></br>  <br>What is there in your first post that even needs to be addressed?</br>  <br>I want reddit to leave.</br>  <br> opinion <br>No. Stop using words you don't understand.<br> everything is canon to itself <br>Read this part? Rebellion is a direct continuation. It's like you're asking "How are episode 7 and 8 related to each other?"<br>Ether way. Homura's black wings state the events of Rebellion are to happen.<br><br>And TDS does contradict the anime. At multiple points.<br>First off, there is an after life even though Madoka had not contracted yet.<br>And there are more. But I have other retards to tell off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do you think you are welcome here at all, tumblr? Also, don't take my posts that are going to be deleted by a tumblr mod who doesn't belong here either as proof you belong.<br><br>And when you are literally saying nothing at all, the best thing to do is insult you. Because it's the best means to point out your faults. If you don't like that negative words can be applied to you, then don't be negative.<br><br><br>How about the whole thing, fuckwit.<br><br>Or how about this. Link a single source anywhere that states your made up definition of canon is true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rebellion is worth watching for eye candy alone.  <br> not opinion <br>Okay then what it is? Please state.<br>  <br> everything is canon to itself <br>So TDS is canon to itself, TVA also, and Rebellion. Okay. <br> direct continuation.  <br>A new concept here. What is direct continuation? Is it different to canon? Why can't you just call it canon? If some pixiv artists draw a sequel of Rebellion, then it becomes a direct continuation?<br> It's like you're asking "How are episode 7 and 8.. <br>No. You are trying to separating each episode in one completed anime. Your metaphor is wrong because if it's right, we now have to think each episodes are canon to themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The series was ended perfectly, there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back. <br>The cliffhanger.</br></br>  <br>Okay. I am not trying to ask any difficult stuff. Is Rebellion canon or not? Please answer with some reasoning.</br>  <br><br> I agree with what you say expect for for everything you said is wrong <br>I love retards like this.<br> A new concept here <br>No, it's not a new concept. It's just another word. Episode two a direct continuation of episode one. This isn't some mythical idea, it's just a term that means exactly what it's stated to be.<br> If some pixiv artists draw a sequel of Rebellion, then it becomes a direct continuation? <br>No. Because it's not official. It's like you failed high school math and don't get that concept that not all rectangles are squares. Same thing here. To be canon something must be official, but not everything that's official must be canon.<br><br>And the full definition of canon was given in my very first post with all of its rules. Apply that to the event of Rebellion and if it fits then it's canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rebellion is canon. <br><br>It is a direct sequel to the original series, by the same writer and animation studio.</br></br></br>  <br>Madoka is American, thus she is best girl.<br><br>  She probably only wears the lewdest of American flag styled bra's and panties on the 4th of july </br></br></br>  <br>... this is a thing?<br><br>well, fuck.</br></br></br>    <br>What? Tamura is fun and a best. I think you just hate Homura focused things or something.</br>    So what's your favorite pairing? <br><br>Kyoko/Mami is my favorite.</br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #5<br><br>Remember to please take it easy and relax.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's your own fault idiot.</br>  <br>they still bitch about you</br>  Requesting my dear Hanako as Cure Scarlet doing mahou shoujo things, but anything else would be lovely as well.
