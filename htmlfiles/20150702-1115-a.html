[ ITT: Girls who should have won.  Is it Tenri bullying time?  The world's not fair, anon. The heart wants what it wants.<br>But if your heart wants Tenri, she's the winner.</br>  <br>diana shouldve won<br><br>hell haqua should've won poor girl</br></br></br>  I can see why keima would fall in love with chihiro but chihiro falls in love with him for no reason off screen. What kind of shit is that.  The pain of rooting for a girl with zero chances of winning<br><br>At least tenrifags had a chance</br></br>    <br>Keima was such an asshole.</br>  Yoshida from Shana. Fuck the.shitty tsundere.  Kek keep crying<br>Chihiro won</br>  <br>it was a happy day</br>  <br> Yoshida <br> not a giant bitch </br></br>  <br>In an alternate universe the author created multiple endings, so each girl can win and readers can enjoy each and every end.</br>  <br>You're waifu</br>  <br> that guy that never learned Keima's point about the real world not being a game </br>  <br>Is there any reason to want Tenri to win apart from pity?<br>She was always a rather dull character who didn't have much to her apart from her crush on Keima. The only thing that could maybe make me want her to win him is that she seemed to have wanted him the most for the longest time, and didn't really get much out of it.</br></br>  <br>What's up with the TWGOK threads lately?</br>  <br> shana <br> not a generic tsundere </br></br>  <br>is that Yui?<br>I can't really feel bad for her, her involvement with Keima turned her whole life around, and she seemed to be the person who was enjoying life the most by the end.</br></br>  A lot of girls should have won. One sort of did I guess  Elsie , one didn't really stand a chance but was still the best  Yui  and the rest never stood a chance  Nanaka, Jun <br><br>Of the main three though the best one did win.  That said, Diana is best goddess. </br></br>  <br>Yup, Yui<br><br>And I guess you're right about that. Besides Yui, I guess Kanon also had her life changed positively?</br></br></br>  Weren't there a bunch of unresolved plotholes?  I'm still upset about this.  <br>Rushed plotlines, not unresolved.<br><br>Elsie was probably going to be more antagonistic.</br></br></br>  <br>Because idiots can't distinguish them liking a character from the protagonist liking a character.<br><br>You don't have to like who Keima likes, but shit like  is pure retardation.</br></br></br>  Shinji is best girl    <br>I think most of them had some positive changes brought about, but it was most pronounced in Yui's case.</br>    <br>who should he have won?</br>  <br>more like girl stuck in the wrong shitty show.</br>  Did she deserve to be BTFO so badly?  LN author went full retard.  <br>But Yozora a shit.</br>  <br>Its called highschool crush.</br>  <br> Got an episode dedicated to her route where she won <br><br>The reason Nagisa has to win in the main show is because of After Story.</br></br></br>  <br>that is bullshit. Everyone else had a their reasons for liking him displayed. chihiro just does off screen with no interaction.</br>  <br><br>Being a Tsukiyofag is suffering</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tenrifags still salty</br>  Is The World God Only Knows any good? Reading about this outrage has me interested.  <br>It's alright. I liked it enough to keep up with it for years. Just be aware that at one point (you'll know it) you're gonna land on namek and not get off for a long time. And when you do it's gonna have a horribly rushed ending.</br>  <br>Stay mad Sanafaggot. The shittiest girl lost hard and deserved it.</br>    <br>fucking this <br>she is so much better then rain</br></br>  <br> I understand it now... <br> The reason Keima-kun wrote that... <br> ... is that our love is never-ending. </br></br></br>  <br>I recognize this post. THK is here.</br>  <br>I recognize this post. The eternally assblasted Sanafaggot is here.</br>   Best development into a very adorable girl <br> Show spent most of its time on her <br> She still lost </br></br>  <br>You're quite late, THK. You missed a StB thread a couple of hours ago and there's another best girl thread with that's calling for you to sperglord in.</br>  <br>Welcome to the japanese love industry.</br>  <br>Forgot my pic.</br>  <br> You missed a StB <br>You sure? And the Harunigger thraed is too obvious. The fact people are still mentioning THK out of nowhere is proof that Haruniggers are masochist scum and enjoy getting shat on.</br></br>  <br>Not your love, no.</br>  <br>The fact that you have to wonder is proof you only just recent got on.<br> Haruniggers <br>You're only making it more obvious, THK.</br></br></br>  <br> The pain of rooting for a girl with zero chances of winning <br>I know what you say.</br></br>  <br>never forget</br>  <br> doesn't deny it <br><br>Stay shit taste, tsunderefag.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing you said so far is valid. One doesn't need to acknowledge anything you say. I'm sure you'll spend all day sperging over tsundere as usual. Enjoy yourself, THK.</br>  <br> not Airi <br><br>It's funny how that show had a tsundere done right and a tsundere done wrong (Sana).</br></br></br>  <br>You don't need to reply again. Sana is the super tsundere. Most fans agreed, don't bother them about it.</br>  <br>You sure acknowledge your precious THK so much that you can't even enjoy a hate-less thread for your shitty waifu without having to remind everyone of how much THK won't let you enjoy her. The Haruna thread is proof. You're traumatized with THK at this point. Just let it go.</br>  <br> Seriously going to pretend he's someone else at this point despite the lack of his threadly posts up from /a/ until half an hour ago, nigger insult, and me vs tsunderefags post <br>Who are you trying to fool?</br></br>  <br><br>Oh please. Sana is best girl and she should had won.</br></br>  <br>No doubt you're proving me right.</br>  <br>Sena deserved it more. Sana got what she deserved.</br>   tfw best girl of the series isn't even a girl   <br>still glad</br>  <br>It's great. The final arc is a bit lower quality but the arc preceding it is fantastic and the ending was rushed but appropriate.</br>    <br> not Yui  <br>Intothetrash,jpg</br></br>  <br>It's very good but the final part was very rushed for some reason and it ended nowhere. Anyone that says Chihiro won is delusional<br><br><br>This. Also Elsie seemed like she was going to develop something bigger for Keima. Too bad we didn't see that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks for reviving memories of the crazy amounts of rivalry and butt hurt that series caused. I was upset the moment it stopped being a light and heartwarming comedy.</br>  <br> you and I <br>I thought Keima was supposed to be a genius. That's a terrible mistake for a genius to make.</br></br>  <br>Tenri was the ONLY girl I didn't care about, at all.<br><br>Even fucking ramen girl was more interesting, or 'literally who' Mio</br></br></br>  <br>She did win. But she was should have won, too.</br>  <br>seriously, why did it have to stop being a series that just had cute girls get won over by a dating Sim enthusiast, they stopped that shit to go serious so quickly too.</br>  <br>yeah :(</br>  <br> generic moeblob alien wins because she's 'main girl' <br> should have won <br>No. Fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>You know what was great about Ichika? How forward she was about the relationship after they started dating. She'll just go and cuddle with him without reservation. And when she's told she has to leave, she doesn't become some suffering martyr, like 99% of anime girls do; she actually throws a tantrum and says, "No, no, no, I don't want to leave, I want to stay here with my boyfriend!" It was really a nice change with what we normally see.<br><br>You think Kanna would have been like that? Kanna would be the generic blushing tsundere, who gets mad and hits him every time he tries to show any affection.

He can't possibly know all the instruments, right? So how do the students learn?</br>  Can someone please take her ribbon off? <br><br>I lack skills.</br></br>  <br>This line made me laugh.<br><br>Yes, Kaori, how did the people not actually practicing for the competition find the time to make a bunch of old tat to give to everyone? It couldn't have been easy.</br></br></br>  <br> He can't possibly know all the instruments, right? <br>Most music majors have at least a basic knowledge of most musical instruments.</br></br>  <br>Either they take private lessons or they help each other when they are practicing in groups.</br>  <br>The parts with the girls being cute were good the rest was shit.</br>   yfw wienerman won the kumikobowl   <br>Most instrumental music education students in universities and conservatories have to take technique classes for brass, woodwind, percussion, and string instruments. They have to be able to at least play simple scales and pieces of music on at least one or two instruments in each category, in addition to becoming proficient on one instrument besides their primary. I don't think Taki would have had a problem with that.</br>  <br>This is nice.</br>  <br>She rolled it down for the competition, it's ok. There's a time and a place.</br>  <br><br>That's how being in band works. Playing an instrument on a basic level isnt hard, so they teach the class the fubdamentals but after that the students should know what to do. Playing in band is mostly about practice and If you need further help, you talk to your section leaders.</br></br>  <br><br>How could you win, when you are the only one running?</br></br>  <br><br>Taking off her ribbon would kill her, /a/non-kun.</br></br>    <br>B team has their own competition against other B teams, they just didn't show it in the anime.</br>  <br> people actually think they are going with the /u/ ending </br>  <br>If it was tumblr that scene would be split into at least 12 gifs with high contrast and sharpened to death.</br>  <br>They had to practice for their own performance, it's like JV band.</br>  <br>thanks heaps !</br>  <br>How can one girl be so perfect?</br>  <br>no one won the kumikobowl because the show wasn't about romance</br>  <br> .gif <br> flashing text <br> color correction <br> 500x281  <br><br> not tumblr </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I'm so glad you said that, rather than pointing out that's not Kaori.<br><br> Sorry, Haruka. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop..

I will for a moment believe that you degenerates didn't fuck up the threads and that facebook tier Yahari ones are actually better.</br>  <br> Original source IS exist <br> People still fall to the bait <br>Sometimes i think you guys deserve it.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow that's real dedication.</br>  <br><br>Yes, put this image bellow.</br></br>  <br>I don't know if it was obvious. The last episode was called "Goodbye Competition" that could mean anything. Also Asuka was talking about how it was all going tone over soon, which implied they weren't sure to win.</br>  Anyone else watched the special yet?  I watched it on a streaming site.   <br>This is amazing</br>  Mamiko never wanted to quit music. She just wanted to be an obedient child and go to uni like her parents wanted. She was Kumiko's inspiration and special person. But she lsot that when she quit. Reina replaces Kumiko's sister in inspiration department.  Ribbons becomes a best girl in volume 2  Not sure if it was better than Tari Tari.  <br>If you seriously didn't think they were going to qualify you need to watch more anime. It was 100% guaranteed from the moment the band decided to do it.</br>  <br>She's already been rising in the ranks</br>  <br>Good one anon</br>  <br>I love Tari Tari but Euphonium is better</br>  <br>Wind ensemble &gt; choir</br>  they will play for anime and video game OSTs when they are older. They will be playing for an anime about band  <br>what about tarou tarou</br>  <br>I welcome my Ribbon overlord.</br>  Can't believe they brought back Ponytail Kumiko in the last episode<br><br>The absolute madmen</br></br>  <br>This is a thing<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oT-<wbr>cfDoczcs&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>After thinking about it, yeah, hibike was better overall. The enjoyment and story/character development felt more consistent. Albeit I liked the suffering in Tari Tari.<br><br><br><br>Best assistant producer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>every thread</br>    <br>I loved the scene where he and Kumiko linked their fingers together after he comforted her.</br>  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/pokzazndvj.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br> it's 8 fucking minutes long <br>There will never be another girl like Kumiko again.</br></br></br>  <br>until Kyoani makes the next girl centered show</br>    <br>Undoubtedly. Someone please just give her an award already.</br>  <br>You are now officially my favorite autist of these threads.</br>  post pictures of Sapphire with her game face on. It's like she transforms to a totally different character when on the contrabass  Who was the girl in the audience?  I just need someone to tell me why the fuck Taki is so perfect. Just one little anon.  <br>I think it was supposed to be reinamom</br>    <br>the fuck</br>  <br>This is high school, while at elementary school or even beginning of middle school the teachers might still have a lot of technical tips, at high school you're expected to already play your instrument at a high level. A teacher is likely to be a lot less proficient in the instrument than the 2nd or 3rd year students, which would have better advice.</br>  <br>Mizore being who again?</br>  <br>tell me if Nozomi actually gets into the band...</br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>Reiclone ohboy player who ribbon is fairly close with. keep up.</br>  your face when season 2 starts with Mizore, Nozomi and Yuuko's middle school band performance and cuts to the prefecturals in Nozomi's POV watching Mizore's solo we never saw.    So who leaves by the beginning of the second volume? Reina and Asuka?  <br>I really liked the first half of Tari Tari, but the second half was a struggle for me to get through. I enjoyed Hibike all the way through, but especially the last episode and 8-10.</br>  <br>Everyone got ponytails, it was fucking amazing. Even Reina sacrificed her specialness to be /ponytail/ with her friends.</br>  <br> Reiclone <br>unfair considering she's been a background character all season</br></br>  What's the point of a second season if Kumiko and Reina won't be the focus?  So how many BD specials can we look forward to?<br><br>Is it one short per BD? How long will it take until all of them are out?</br></br>  <br>Kumiko gets focus</br>  <br>To pave the way for more interesting characters and circumstances?<br><br>Even then, Reina and Kumiko are here to stay for the duration of all subsequent seasons, and novel 2 is supposed to be full of yuribait</br></br></br>  Title Drop    <br>oh and something about Reina stalking Taki-sensei</br>  Does anyone have a list of the pieces they played?  <br>Reina wasn't supposed to be the focus for this season, either. Almost all of her scenes and importance so far have been original; no reason to think the same wouldn't happen in the sequel, especially with how popular her character has become.</br>  <br> A teacher is likely to be a lot less proficient in the instrument than the 2nd or 3rd year students <br>I don't think you understand how bands and orchestras work. The guy at the front is not an instrument instructor, he's there to make sure everything fits together. Of course he'll point out when people are screwing up, but it's not his job to teach them their instrument. Some schools will employ professional instrument teachers to do that, others will just expect their band/orchestra members to have private tuition.</br></br>  <br>In the final episode? They just played 2</br>  <br>I know, that's what I was trying to explain to the guy who asked. Sorry if it came off as unclear.</br>    <br>I mean for the entire show.<br>What were their names?</br></br>  <br>she's the #1 in the band right?</br>  <br>You are ill-informed, anon.</br>  Why does everyone loves this show?  <br>Except this is nowhere near the level of hype and popularity those shows received.</br>    <br>#1 cutest?</br>  <br> Giving breasts to my flat Kumiko </br>  I took the subway today and there was a guy playing the oboe. When i got off I saw another dude with his saxophone and later an old laying playing the flaute.<br>It's coming for me anons, the irl hibike! will get me soon.</br>  <br>Fuck Yuuko really does just go straight from shit to greatness huh? I was prepared to hate her forever but as of ep. 12 the most I could muster was some fake disdain.</br>  <br> everyone <br>Its not that popular. Its no where near popular. Where did you get "everyone" from?</br></br>  <br>/u/ was exposed and made fun of by a large animation studio.</br>  KyoAni shot themselves in the foot marketing this as K-ON band edition. This is way deeper that that!  <br>Good concert band drama, interesting characters and story, actually about music with a lot of attention to detail<br><br>In general, one of the very, very few anime focused on concert band music</br></br></br>  <br>You should be happy she got what she wished for. Even though it came at a price.</br>  <br>#1 from the skill level I though<br><br>Followed by Saphire and Asuka as far as I gathered from previous threads.

Because I didn't even hear Asuka play anything by herself that wasn't sight-reading.</br>  <br> Is this from the novel though? <br>yes this is info from a novelfag<br><br>search the archive</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope they show the power levels in Hibike.

I'm ok with this.<br>Those fluff-forsaken infidels must learn.</br></br>  <br>Because she's a good main protagonist?<br>On top of being fluffy and noisy of course<br><br>if Natsuki didn't exist she would be best girl</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>not my best girl but she looks pretty hot I've gotta give you that</br></br>  Name one reason why you couldn't fall in love with Taki<br>protip:  you can't </br>  <br>She looks so cool and calm playing like that<br><br>What a sexy gal</br></br></br>  <br>Doing God's work, anon.</br>  <br> hahi~ <br>She must be Akari's ancestor</br></br>  <br>i'm not brash enough to trample on the dead</br>  <br>What's not to like?</br>  <br>Her autism is entertaining, and /a/ could relate to that. Also, lesbians.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127440598   <br>She's fluffy, makes funny sounds and faces, is awkward but tries to speak her mind, and has genuine growth as a character and becomes someone who strives to be the best she can.

And then a movie where they go to London and watch the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and play at a Japanese festival.</br>  <br>Natsuki is like a 1 before an exponent, she's automatically understood to be the best girl regardless of whether or not you preface discussions of any of the girls with it.</br>   yfw Reina is literally irrelevant in S2 beyond her crush on Taki-sensei <br>Are you ready for Oboe domination, /a/? Anyone has a link to that thread in which NovelAnon spoiled everything?</br>  <br><br><br>my understanding of maths is shit.<br>currently on this website to understand your post.<br><br>http://www.mathsisfun.com/exponent.<wbr>html<br><br> mathsisfun.com <br> kill me </br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>check<br><br/></br></br>  <br>does she at least have a good realtionship with the fagotts? It'd be sad if she didn't.</br>  <br>Yuribait between characters that aren't Kumiko and Reina. Mizore seems to be an actual lesbian.</br>  <br>a better example would have been a 1 before a variable but whatever.</br>  <br>I'll end up buying it if there are no rips.</br>  <br><br>B E A U T I F U L</br></br>   tfw final concert probably took more budget than all Nodame Cantabile concerts combined <br><br>Not sure if that's sad or funny.</br></br>  <br>she's just super shy with super low self esteem. Any kind of affection would be multiplied</br>  I still can't get over how good the last episode was. Knowing that there probably won't be a second season is depressing.  <br>BELIEVE</br>  Is she the fluffiest autistic anime protag?<br> communicates using moans and grunts and GEH <br> I LIKE EUPHONIUM <br> plays euphonium at home despite being told not to <br> I LIKE EUPHONIUM </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think that it ended perfectly. Enough setup that you want to see more, but enough closure that you don't need it.</br></br>  I wish to have a wife like Haruka  <br>There will be more Hibike some day. OVA, S2, Movie, only the KyoAni gods know. But we will hear their  special  music again.</br>  <br>Also<br> I want to try another instrument this year <br> hey Kumiko you play Eupho? <br> I LIKE EUPHONIUM </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She talks to her cactus too.</br></br>  <br>The OVA is confirmed, right?</br>  <br>For fuck's sake she's not autistic, there are actual autistic characters in this show. At least three that we're aware of.</br>  <br>I almost fell in love with Taki during last episode.</br>  <br>nice quads. I haven't seen official confirmation unless something has changed in the past couple of days, but it's all but guaranteed to fill out the last BD. Something about a pool party?</br>  <br> good player <br> still needs to tape the fuck out of her fingers <br><br>Everybody should develop calluses in the first couple of years of serious playing. Only if you have horrible technique or if you abuse slap will you ever need tape.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Amazing story, good character, good music, amazing pacing, best episode of the decade. What else so you want?</br>  <br>Kumiko doesn't really strike me as autistic. She's just socially awkward, and the whole "I like euphonium" thing was because she rediscovered her passion for the euph and it made her really happy.</br>  <br>she already has callouses as shown in the earlier episodes. But she stressed herself out again because they were aiming high. She's also young so her skin probably still grows over callouses</br>  <br> best episode of the decade </br>  <br>Whatever you think, casual. It was rated as so, your opinion is pretty much shallow and irrelevant.  go back to the ore monogatari thread you autistic faggot </br>  <br>I fell in love with him the moment I saw him</br>  so the drum captain was basically a harem MC wasn't he.  i am the only who think Hyouka was better?  <br>so many buzzwords, so little content and for some reason an attack Shoujo that almost nobody is watching on /a/<br><br>congratulations, you're officially retarded</br></br></br>  <br>That's not how it works. Once you get calluses, you dont lose them unless you completely stop playing for years. <br><br>Her skills are as fake as her name.</br></br></br>  <br> am I the only one <br><br>no fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>Are you actually expecting people from /a/ to understand what autism means?</br>  Why did they promote Midori and Hazuki as main characters when they were almost completely irrelevant?  <br>If you had any experience in band whatsoever you'd expect them to not get nationals.</br>  <br>you can still hurt yourself even with calousses. The show already stated early on that she had.</br>  If I was a teacher and a cute girl of legal age was after my dick I would hit that shit so hard.<br>Taki confirmed for fucking beta</br>  Reminder:<br><br>Kekkai Sensen 17K+<br>Hibike ~7k</br></br></br>  <br>never, the show didn't sell well</br>  <br>too bad kekkai was shit</br>  Shit like oreimo can easily sell over 50k. <br>Kyaoni needs to step up their game and break the boundaries. Go for the taboo, kyoani.<br>Go for it.</br></br>  <br>and Hibike had an event ticket, next volumes will barely sell 4k</br>  <br>Popularity=/= Quality.</br>  <br>Of course. But it's a fucking KyoAni production whose ending has been spoiled like 1000 times in these threads. Really, what kind of show would it be if they had this great rags to riches story and overcame all their hardships and then in the last episode they just fail. KyoAni would never make that show, especially not just to go against the source material.</br>  <br>So is Nisekoi, but that's also going to continue  forever <br>Meanwhile, Hibike will go into the KyoAni hell next season never.</br></br>  <br>still better and more original than hibike<br>And at least it's 100% sure that kekkai will get a second season</br></br>  <br>Yeah cancer, now just go fuck yourself back to whatever shithole you came from.</br>  My first post on /a/, back in 2005 or 2006 I think, was asking about an obscure memory I had of an anime I watched as a kid. All I could recall about it was that there were these big bug things and a poisonous jungle or something.<br><br>The people on /a/ back then laughed, but they weren't dicks about my question, however dumb it might have been. "Nausicaa," anon said. "Any time there's an anime someone barely remembers, it's always Nausicaa."<br><br>Do you remember why you came to /a/?</br></br></br></br>  <br>To talk about anime and call you a faggot.</br>  <br>Nothing good ever happened in my life</br>  <br>I was bored last summer.</br>  To talk about anime.<br>And the result? It makes me more bitter towards anime.</br>  <br><br>Which anime? If you don't mind my asking.</br></br>  I came here because they started banning people on /r/anime/ for random stuff.<br>I actually like not having an account.</br>  <br>I first came to 4chan through /w/ in search of good anime desktop wallpapers. Then I enter /a/ and </br>  It was 2005, I had been on /b/ for all of 2 days and saw a lot of pictures being posted from Azumanga Daioh. I wanted to watch it, so I learned how to download/stream when my internet went to shit. After that I came to /a/ seeking more series that you couldn't get in the States, particularly things popular on 4chan like Berserk, Yotsuba, Rozen Maiden, and Jojo. I've been here ever since.  Because I lost interest in /b/.  <br>I was reading Franken Fran on Gurochan the First back like in 2007and suddenly I realized that on the /a/ - anime &amp; manga board of 4chan I could probably talk about anime and manga all day, every day. yep, I discovered Gurochan before 4chan. pretty strange uh?</br>  Rurouni Kenshin was my first manga. I wanted to discuss it on /a/.  I was searching for something GitS-related and bumped up into a 4chan thread. I had no idea what imageboards are back then, but the whole segmented rotating anonymous thing picked my interest.  <br>I asked /a/ to suggest an anime and told them I liked Outlaw Star. People suggested Gurren Lagann. I was pleased with the result so I kept coming back.</br>  <br>When I was 16 a friend of mine mentioned 4chinchin. Curious I checked it out. /a/ didn't really appeal to me back then as I was only watching OP at that time.<br>I left after 30 minutes of lurking.<br>When another friend of mine got me into the more serious stuff 1 1/2 years later I cheked it out again. Quite fond of it I lurked for nearly 2 weeks before making my first post.<br>I came to /a/ inorder to discuss animu.<br>I didn't browse any other animu forum prior to this one.</br></br></br></br></br>  I went to 4chan in 2004 or 2005 because some "girl" with really cute avatars and banners on Animesuki was sad about 4chan going down. My first post was agreement with another poster than Natsuki is the best Mai Hime girl.  <br> picked by interest <br>The term is "piqued" you dunce.</br></br>  NICE ANIME THREAD FAGLORD  <br>I starting getting a little burnt out on mecha and wanted to talk about anime like Lupin III. I haven't really been on /m/ as much in the past year of so.</br>  <br>I browsed /b from 2009 - 2011, then started browsing /v/ and /x/ as well. When /r9k/ came back I browsed that for a while too, but then mainly posted on /tv/ for the majority of the next 2 years.<br>I made the jump to /a/ when a friend showed me Madoka and I was reasonably impressed. I spent the next 2 years or so watching as many anime series as possible and pretty much abandoned /tv/ and only lurked /a/. By the start of this year when I reached around 500 anime I started feeling comfortable enough to post. I solely browse and post on /a/ now,  /jp/, /gif/ /hc/ for JAV threads on occasion too  because the last two years spent on anime made me miss out on any vidya or tv and film that I could discuss. Not that I'm missing out on anything by not going to /v/ or /tv/ anymore, the difference in quality between most boards and /a/ is astounding. If you think /a/ is shit, you've never been to /tv/.</br></br>  I came here to discuss anime. Unfortunately, everyone here has entry-level plebeian taste and doesn't know shit about any anime pre-Evangelion.  <br>I browsed /lit/ back in 2009. After finding an old tank of negima, i started getting into manga/anime and sort of migrated here as my interest grew.</br>  <br>Some friends told me about how stupid people here is. I came to check it and laugh the whole time I lurked. Have been coming here since then.<br><br>My first post was 6 minutes after I entered, the whole "lurk more" is for faggots.</br></br></br>  Because of this fat asian faggot at my school.  <br>I came here to tell strangers on the internet that their taste in animated Japanese TV-shows is wrong.</br>  <br>No YOUR taste is animated Japanese TV-shows is wrong!</br>  The first raid I had here was Kill la Kill.<br><br>I got gradually into /a/ when I started watching airing anime, the first times I browsed /b/ and then one day I fell in this black hole and now I want to became a little girl like all of you.</br></br>  <br>Well one thing is certain and that's the fact that I didn't come here to change my opinion</br>  I first used 4chan to collect hentai because I was a horny teenager back during 05-06, so I mostly hanged out around /e/ or /h/. Got bored of that quickly and left for about a year. Then I came back, this time to /a/ for reasons that I can't remember. It was early 08 I think.  <br>So you came here to constantly be told that your taste is shit? Are you a masochist?</br>  <br>Your thread is shit</br>  i started as a /b/tard in ~05, hardly ever went on /a/ because it looked like shit.<br><br>i warmed up to it around 07~  (i mainly watched manime),  and have been a /fit/izen since 08 or 09.<br><br>for the last 10 years i have always had atleast 1 4chan tab open, when i start my computer the first thing i do is open /a/  and /v/ <br><br> i still only know hiragana </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Director's cut when?  <br>so lewd</br>  <br> penis approaching at top speed to invade Izana in the shower </br>  It doesn't work like that.  <br>Wait, it's been ages since I read Solaris, what does Sidonia has to do with it again?</br>  <br>The whole theme of a gigantic, unknowable, apparently intelligent alien entity that is so incomprehensibly different that communication is impossible?</br>  Drawfag Thread 1526<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1509:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1525 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Claiming first post for  non lewd requests    Requesting Kafuka as a stand for any of the Zetsubous.

Perhaps shes busy texting with a bored look on her face, or whatever you want.</br></br>  Requesting Blanc too hot due to the pretty hot and humid weather, annoyed too, or watching the rain rather melancholically.  <br>Aside from reading books, your best bet is to observe real life. You can get a good sense of how to make a pose more fluid just by watching how the human body moves. <br><br>Start with really basic gesture sketches, and build up from there.</br></br></br>  <br>That request might as well have been finished</br>  Push forward in your journey! Don't give up! Don't throw your hard work away <br>You can do it newfriends. Ganbatte!</br>  Requesting a drawing of Reimu wearing nothing but a C-string and pasties with her arms behind her back and looking embarrassed/cute. Here's a couple reference images.  Requesting Mikoto Misaka patrolling the wastes with an armored vault jumpsuit and a Gauss rifle.  <br>From my own experience, life drawing is the way to go. An important thing about life drawing is to constantly look at the thing you're drawing, You need to drill into your head you're drawing the object in-front of you, not the object you think is in front of you. Constantly check you're not rearing off course. Don't just look once and say "that's good" and never look back.<br>Another good thing to learn are the bones in the body.Knowing how the body is built allows me to look at pictures, both other's works and my own while I'm drawing.</br></br>  <br>Cyanfag pls.</br>  cyan stretching in gym wear. make her flustered and a little sweaty  I'm only reposting this once: <br><br>If I can't find one drawfag who's a fan of both Index and dark humor, I'm gonna be disappoint.</br></br>  Sorry to ask but is it possible to see a WIP of the twintail fusion?  Requesting Rin eating bread  <br>As I recall it was not finished.</br>  requesting a continuation of pic related<br><br> soft femdom preferred  </br></br>  <br>What was so unfinished about it?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Thank you for the advice drawfriends! Hopefully one day I can draw all your waifus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Like this? <br>http://imgur.com/SnKKaij</br></br>  <br>thats not soft at all m8</br>  Requesting Sawyer wearing a pretty dress like this one:<br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2736784<br><br>No shoes.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>The artist did not finish it, simple.</br>  <br>Its a little soft. How soft is soft?</br>  <br>he's right though even if he's not entirely correct. Drawing directly from photographs will take with it photography errors while also forgetting the fact that illustrating something is used to convey an idea of something not a realistic thing.<br>if you take a picture of a girl running, 9/10 you'll have a shitty picture that doesn't look good, if you draw that you'll even up with an even shittier picture that looks nothing like what you want.<br>I've had pictures of me taken mid fighting where I looked like I was sleeping, if you drew that and put it off as a "fight scene" people would laugh at you.</br></br></br>  <br>Looked pretty fucking done to me last time I saw it</br>  Would it be rude to request something that I already got delivered in the WWD?  <br>gentle caressing/teasing and dick stroking, no ass play or pegging<br><br>haven't you ever read an /ss/ doujin before?</br></br></br>  <br>yes, but do it anyways, if it was that bad I'm sure the drawfag doesn't mind, and if he does he's a fuckin cunt.</br>  <br>The only good ones are the ones with mom/futadom. Get with it.</br>  <br>I think one thing people forget is that humans (usually) have 2 eyes. This means we look at things with 2 lenses. Both videos and photographs are taken with a camera which only has 1 lens. When you draw from a photograph, you're also drawing a flattened image.</br>  Requesting if I may, Gaen Izuko (the adult) with Kanbaru Suruga sitting on her lap with Gaen getting Kanbaru to repeat "Muchi Muchi"  <br>hey I'm the one requesting here and i want gentle, loving, femdom</br>  <br>It's not that it was bad, it's just a "I like the concept so much I want to see other drawfags take on it".</br>  <br>Well link some refs. Your request is lacking.</br>  Going to try again. I was hoping that maybe somebody could please make some hair for Haruno. I've provided a reference of her, and some hair of another character from the same series in the same format. Thanks for considering. <br>http://imgur.com/NwtfVql<br><br>Please ;_;</br></br></br>  So the blue hair girl from Gundam 0096 is  10 years old  so i'd like to see her around 17-18 or just some general lewd of her. Or some /ss/ with the protag in the middle or smut in general.  The Exterminate song on YouTube got deleted.<br>Now I can't loop it anymore because I didn't downloaded it at that time.<br>Can't find it on nyaa.<br>Where can I find it, so I can loop it again?</br></br></br>  <br>Search your heart. There you will find it.</br>   <br> not predicting it will get taken down and instantly downloading it when you get the chance. <br><br>Also,<br>ONLY TWO MORE DAYS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have the determination to FIST?</br>  <br>I don't.<br>I don't think I ready. I will just let myself get swept away by the torrent.</br></br>  <br>thanks Anon!</br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/APG2Xr6J<br><br>I uploaded them for that reason.</br></br></br>  Thank God somebody made one.<br>I crave these threads like crack.</br>  <br>I know that feel. Looking for Sympho threads is the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning.</br>  <br>Can't wait for who will give us the jam this time.</br>  <br>Genjuuro</br>  <br>I feel sorry for Tsubasa since she seems to be the only one that's flat. Everyone else have cowtits.<br>Even Shirabe's grew out a little bit more.</br></br>  <br><br>Genjuuro symphogear when</br></br>  <br>She doesn't have an ass either.<br>She probably has a nice toned tummy, if you're into that sort of thing.</br></br>  <br>hell yeah motherfucker</br>  <br>He doesn't need one.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but can you imagine him with one while singing the whole time?<br><br>I'm not gay and I don't like men but my dick would be erect</br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ. How does he just gently grasping the metal pole crush the damn thing?<br>Even Superman can do that shit.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know what you mean.<br>I was semi-chub during the G training montage to be honest.<br><br><br>He's the hero we need.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She isn't flat, they're just small.</br>  <br>Always did wonder what was the point of the gear users when Genjuuro probably could have done most of their work.<br>If Genjuuro was also singing with Zwei Wing, I doubt Kanade would have died.</br></br>  We've had land battles (S1), naval warfare (S2), and the trailer hints what we all know must come next: Aerospace.<br><br>Are we gonna get Zenmetsu Hibiki? Will there be another Gungnir Datto?! Is NotCommie going to throw away two seasons of convention and translate Swan Song as Superb Song? Will Miku and Hibiki finally get married? Is Ver going to redeem himself and become a True Action Hero?<br><br>Will Tsubasa ever graduate highschool?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Will Tsubasa ever graduate highschool? <br>Already confirmed. She's off being an idol with Maria while DMJii go to school.</br></br>  <br>He can't do shit against noise, since he's human.<br>Not directly, anyway.</br></br>  <br> Genjuuro probably could have done most of their work. <br>You need a Gear to not get exploded on contact by Noise. You're correct for every non-Noise opponent though.</br></br>  <br>I was talking about him taking the singing parts. Genjuuro singing Orbital Beat with the other two would be great.</br>  <br>sometimes she has a big ass,sometimes she hasn't, It's really weird</br>  <br>i still think their backup plan was quite literally people tying complete relics around his hands and feet and using them so he can strike at the noise with his martial arts bullshit.</br>  <br>Now I won't be satisfied until I see that.</br>  <br>Commie won't do it.</br>  Is someone subbing it this time?  <br>Where was this?</br>  So wait, the new characters are a bunch of androids, a literal wizard and her pet loli?<br><br>I-Is this season going to be Symphogeah vs Vocaloid?</br></br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05232 these guys are</wbr></br>  <br> I-Is this season going to be Symphogeah vs Vocaloid? <br>HYYYYYYYYYYYPE!</br></br>  <br>BASED</br>  <br> We don't translate native concepts such as mythology, foods, or customs unique to the language/country (unless it has an !

Isn't it dedicated to her by default?</br>  <br>Symphogear threads are automatically dedicated to her.<br>Mostly because there's Nanafags here no matter what time you ask. There's also that hardcore guy that tells stories of Nana.</br></br>  <br>Is it 7' o clock already?</br>  <br>First day of the 7th month.</br>  <br> tfw its already the seventh month of the year <br>Its Nana's month!</br></br>  <br>This month is official nana month!</br>  <br> its also the month where GX starts airing <br>I bet they planned this.</br></br>  <br> 2015 is over halfway finished already <br>fuck</br></br>  <br>Time really flies fast.<br>It'll only be a matter of time until Nana reaches 40.</br></br>  <br> tfw Smile Gang is also near its 700th episode <br>What a nice month.</br></br>  <br>She's forever 17.</br>  <br>She's not Yukarin, Nana is aware of her age.<br>She even joked about her age being 17x2 on her 34th birthday.</br></br>  Can we talk about Symphogear please, not about same song mcmolested as a child?  <br>u wot m8</br>   thread became Nana praising thread again <br>I really wonder why we haven't put "Nana thread" in the subject yet.</br>  <br>not wanting to worship Nana</br>    <br><br>/jp/ exists for this.</br></br>  <br> same song not mcmolested as a child <br>Look at this faggot who hasn't even tried to listen to Nana's music asides Synchrogazer and Vitalization.<br>Try to listen to her first albums before trying to judge her, fag.</br></br></br>  <br>So, asides Symphogear openings and insert songs, what other songs of Nana have you listened to, Mr. Expert?</br>  <br> complains about people talking about Nana on a Symphogear thread <br> thinks seiyuu talk goes on /jp/ <br>Be more subtle with those baits.</br></br></br>   idolfags <br><br><br>To be fair, she's more of an idol than a seiyuu.</br></br></br>  <br>Moot point, even idol seiyuu are discussed here and not on /jp/.</br>  <br>Well they should take it to the seiyuu threads then and not derail Symphogear threads all the time.</br>  <br>She's a damn Seiyuu-Artist. She calls herself a Seiyuu-Artist, everyone calls her a Seiyuu-Artist. Even Music Japan calls her a Seiyuu-Artist. No because she sings and dance in lives doesn't mean she's automatically an idol, you dumb fuck.</br>  <br>And we should take the yuri talk to /u/?<br>The Chris imagedumps to /c/?<br>Whether you like it or not, that's not how /a/ as a board works, Anon.</br></br></br>  <br>The show hasn't even aired yet, dumbass. Go bitch somewhere else.</br>  <br>I'd love if that'd happen.</br>  <br>How can you expect multi-track drifting if the train doesn't derail in the first place?</br>  <br>Well how about not having running generals then?<br><br>Second season was plagued by uneaded threads when episodes were not out.</br></br></br>  <br>Just ignore it? Or are you upset because whatever shit thread you tried to make got archived with 0 replies? If that's not the case there's no way this affects you. While we can't discuss episodes of S3 we can discuss things related to the show, which includes voice actors.</br>  <br>No no, you have it all wrong. I love Symphogear.<br><br>It's just that there is nothing to discuss yet so it's just a petty circlejerk with no real meaning.<br><br>I mean hype treads are alright but having multiple threads daily and even having those dreaded "edition" threads just takes away all the fun in hyping an anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just let them be if they want to discuss Nana. Hate it or not, Nana is related to Symphogear and its inevitable that someone will bring her name on these threads at times, that is one of the ordinary things in these threads, if they want to discuss her let them be, once GX airs we'll go back to Symphogear with minimum amount of Nanaposting anyway. <br>Also, stop saying things like Nana is a piece of shit, if she doesn't exist and advertise this show, this show wouldn't have existed at all. If you love Symphogear, learn to respect Nana.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear is more than just Nana anon.</br>  <br>Good thing we don't discuss only seiyuu in these or the /m/ threads then.</br>  For sake of appeasing anon, has there been any new info or comments from the pre-screening besides plot spoilers and  Chris-chan cute ?<br>Anything on Aoi/Nana's blogs, twitter/etc about the show?</br>  <br>Yes, but she's one of the major factors why this show sells.<br>She is one of King Records' top seller, and she's literally at the top of the voice acting industry today. No matter how hard you push Aoi Yuuki, she doesn't have the same popularity as Nana's even if you combine Takagaki Ayahi's fans too. I'm not biased, I'm stating this with references surveys about favorite VAs.<br>So basically my point is, yes, its more than Nana, but let's be honest, if we replace the cast with literally who's this show wouldn't have sold at all.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't have cared if she were in it or not, sales don't mean shit to me. I just enjoy it.</br>  <br>I don't know about Aoi, but Nana's very busy with her live rehearsals that her blog updates is one or two days late.<br>I think Re birth day preview is coming soon.</br></br>  <br>Aoi has not written anything on her blog, and Nana wasn't even in the event.<br>Most you can do is fish for comments in twitters from some of the 500 people that attended the event. We posted translation for a few of them some threads ago.</br></br>  I was watching my twitter feed for any Aoi news, and noticed that they uploaded "Best Of" scenes in the official Symphogear youtube channel.<br><br>https://twitter.com/Anime_Voice/sta<wbr>tus/616229297229967360<br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS<wbr>ECkCuFpjNrO9CQ-uvQqcg/videos</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> I think Re birth day preview is coming soon. <br>I think it was tomorrow actually<br>Correct me if I'm wrong</br></br></br>  <br>Are they region blocked?</br>  <br> Aoi <br>Nothing on her blog<br> Nana <br>Very busy with rehearsals, the start of Live Adventure 2015 is after the day GX airs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently they are.<br>Each seiyuu selected a favorite Symphogear scene, it seems.<br>For example, Ishikawa choose Genjuro VS Fine.</br></br></br>  <br>What did Chris' VA pick?<br><br>Also I have to say, Aoi and Nana are very well known, but Chris is someone I don't recognise so well, dspite her amazing talent. What are some other good anime I can hear her in (idealy singing)?</br></br></br>  <br> tfw most of Nana's fans don't watch her anime </br>  <br>Just listen to her albums.</br>  <br>What is the gear trio's favorite?</br>  <br>I can't into moon, but in case the titles have the VAs name in them</br>  <br>Episode Heart-attack of G, judging from the thumbnail.<br><br>You should know.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the mainstream fans like her mostly as an artist and not a seiyuu.</br>  <br> Hibiki rekt Chris with that same move  <br><br>Sasuga</br></br></br>  Has there been any sort of character rankings since G ended?  <br><br>Give me a second and I will check all of them.<br> Nana <br>Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki<br> Ayahi  <br>Classroom Monochrone<br> Ao-chan <br>The entire Synchrogazer scene</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They're all choosing scenes with their own characters <br>They really love their characters. That makes me fluffy inside</br></br>  <br>Those are probably the only scenes they can remember.</br>  <br>Anon don't be rude</br>  <br>Don't ruin anon's fluffy moment, anon.</br>  <br> Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki <br><br>Aw yes this scene is finally on youtube it was one of my favorites. She gets over shadowed a lot but she is probably the most skilled fighter of the bunch. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EcH<wbr>REFFvrGY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>   That one guy whose favorite scene is Chris' transformation sequence   <br>Aoi said she and Iguchi all choosed the same scene where Hibiki fought Miku in S2E10, but the rule is one people one scene.</br>  <br>Such good taste.</br>  <br>Someone I can relate to.<br><br>Did Sugita pick one? I really want to know.</br></br></br>  <br>Main animator Shikichi is always a Chris fag since S1. Most of Chris' scenes were drawn by him including that sequence.</br>   Kayano <br>DMJii at the school festival.<br> Iguchi <br>Rainbow Flower.<br> Hikasa <br>G finale scene when all the girls talk together near the end.<br> Kaneko  <br>One of those cute OVA specials.<br> Jesus Yamato <br>Tsubasa's speech during her concert in S1.<br> Ishikawa <br>Genjuro VS Fine.<br> Nana <br>Tsubasa's last stand against Fine/Berbikki.<br> Nanjolno <br>Shirabe and Kirika mutual confession.<br> Ayahi  <br>Classroom Monochrone.<br> Ao-chan <br>The entire Synchrogazer scene.<br> Katsumi Ono <br>Maria singing Ressou Gugnir and going against Noise in the tower.<br> Agematsu <br>SHINFOOOOGIAAAAAAAA<br><br>There are few left out that are either animators, artist for the manga, etc<br> No Sugita or Sawashiro <br><br>What would make you believe that?<br>Seems specially incoherent when for example Aoi remembers the cantonese lyrics for Eiyuu Koji of all things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No Sugita or Mom's VA.</br>  <br> Ogawa's favorite is Tsubasa's speech in S1 <br>Sasuga prodyuusaa-san.</br></br>  <br>Well, Soichiro and Sugita are hardcore Nanafags.</br>  <br>There is a comment in the keyframes book where they said they all worked extra hard on the monochrome scene and did it all for Chris-chan.</br>  <br>That's so cute.... what a lovely bunch. I hope Chris is loved in GX too.</br>  <br>I want to fuck the dess out of her.</br>  <br>Soichiro is? I know Sugita is one because he's on the damn POP MASTER PV and he really talks about her and even makes fun of her songs sometimes. Too bad he'll forever be Sugita-kun to Nana.</br>  <br> Souichiro <br>Ninja, or Jesus Yamato's VA.</br></br>  Get to dancing, niggas.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=r6w<wbr>2mTa_zMA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yes I know who he is, I'm just surprised to know he's a hardcore Nanafag like Sugita.</br>  <br>Because he just confessed it this February.</br>  <br> Nana dance lessons <br>Wow, I haven't seen these since Live Academy.<br>You should send that to Nanoha threads since its Angel Blossom.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow, no wonder I didn't knew about it. What did he say exactly?</br>  <br> You should send that to Nanoha threads since its Angel Blossom. <br>But we're all nanafags, and its a nana song.</br></br>  I want to get into Nana<br>Which live do I watch first?</br>  <br> all Nanafags <br> Did you forget some people here are Aoifags and some people hate Nana for being popular or something?</br></br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br><br>Live Grace 2013 Opus II is my personal favorite.</br></br>  <br>I'm not<br><br>I'm here mainly for action, not songs</br></br></br>  <br>Not too much. He said he always sings Nana's songs when he goes to Karaoke or discuss Nana's songs a lot at party.</br>  <br>Maybe Live Union 2012, that was a nice concert.<br>But my favorite as of yesterday is Live Theater Acoutic 2015, because that's where you'll really know Nana isn't only good because of wubwubs and technical accompaniment.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So how is this any different from Funi subs?</br></br></br>  <br> So how is this any different <br>They exist?</br></br>  <br>Why do i feel like there's romance flags getting set?<br><br>Each Nana live has a theme of its own. For example, in Live Flight 2014, Nana really used the concept of flight and she even "flew" which caused her to get sick, in Live Theater she used the concept of a theater, formal and stuff. Live Academy, she made videos teaching dance lessons and shit. There are many to choose from, look at Wikipedia, choose one Nana concert you think sounds interesting and watch it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was asking in general quality with previous funi subs.</br></br>  <br> romance flags <br>You know when Nishikawa had a duet with Nana 2 years ago lots of Nana and Nishikawa fags thought the same thing right?</br></br>  <br>I prefer NanaXHikasa.</br>  <br>Yukarin fags will riot then.</br>  Just watched both seasons. Wish I had watched them with you guys.  <br>TMRxNana duets are great. They should do one again.</br>  <br>You are in time for S3 at least.</br>  <br>Please explain how anything in that statement makes them like funi subs. Or do you just love when commie localizes rice balls into jelly doughnuts.</br>  <br>Welcome to Nana's wild ride</br>  <br>It was better times.</br>  <br> I'm really really bothered by her crooked right incisor. I can't help myself but stare at it all the time and then feel bad about staring at it. Why hasn't she had braces to fix it yet? </br>  <br> make a live tour named Fly Fly <br> doesn't sing Kindan no Resistance <br>Nana a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Kindan no Resistance didn't exist yet.</br>  <br>It's kind of cute though.</br>  <br>This series' hype train is off the charts</br>  <br>How? Was the concert in january?</br>  <br>Is there one for S1?</br>  <br>Live Flight was in summer 2014 wasn't it? Cross Ange was in October.</br>  <br>But she sang it in the Singapore concert.</br>  Rebirth-day when  <br>But they should have recorded the song earlier. Like months earlier. I just don't know why they made the reference then.</br>  From 0 to Madoka, how much suffering is there in this show?  <br><br> Use proxmate, my fellow german. </br></br>  <br>I'd say about 3.<br>There's light suffering but it's all overcome with fighting spirit and hotblood.</br></br>  <br><br>They say it's going to be darker this time, so more than in S1 and S2.</br></br>  <br>It's hard to pinpoint it on that scale, however<br>1 = SOL<br>5 = symphogear<br>7 = Madoka<br>10 = YuYuYu<br><br>It has it's brutal suffering moments, but friendship and being true to yourself wins everytime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> YuYuYu more suffering than Madoka </br>  Some what related question, anons.<br>How many here also enjoyed the following: <br><br>-Gerren Laggan<br>-Metal Gear Rising: Revengence<br>-Kill la Kill<br>-Ace Combat Games</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is left? I just saw this episode and cannot clearly tell. Is it the new, pink concert/symphogear girl?</br>  <br> 10 = YuYuYu <br> Didn't YuYuYu cop out at the end? </br></br>  <br><br>Gurren Lagann was okay but not as good as Gainax's earlier works like Gunbuster or Blazing Transfer Student<br><br>MGR was alright but too short. Wonderful 101 was better.<br><br>I only watched KLK because I needed something to fill the void after G ending<br><br>Ace combat is alright, but I need to play it more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's her sister.</br>  <br>I can't see the point.</br>  <br>Holy shit I butchered the Gurren Lagann.</br>  <br>Yes, and I guess I should have kept it at the 9 that I originally typed. but still,  did you see my awesome fight? </br>  <br><br>Except he's right</br></br>  <br>Re is the worst offender.</br>  <br>That cop out was a cop out, based on those new LN chapters, the suffering's gonna continue.</br>  <br>Each has either a great over the top action and/or great ost.</br>  <br>Oh, then I enjoyed MGR. But I thinl Bayonetta is more fun.</br>  <br>Except YuYuYu's suffering was pretty much erased at the end. Even Madoka pre-Rebellion had more suffering by the end with Sayaka. Rebellion took it to a whole new level though.</br>  <br>How is this related?<br> GL <br>Pretty damn good, but ultimately a worse Getter Robo that was lucky enough to get proper budget/staff<br> MGR <br>Amazing. I prefer Ninja Gaiden though.<br> KLK <br>Wasted potential.<br> Ace Combat <br> COME ON!!!!!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except YuYuYu's suffering was pretty much erased at the end. <br>Confirmed for not reading the LN.</br></br>  <br>How so? I thought the cripple punishment was gone for good?</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>They're doing a lot of hinting at something being wrong with Yuuna.</br>  <br>haha, okay pal.</br>  <br>Yuuna might be 0% human.</br>  <br>Gurren Lagann is really enjoyable, though  I need to actually finish it <br><br>I need to play MGR, because it looks like the kind of game that I'd really enjoy<br><br>I wanted to like KLK, but everything felt so horridly watered down compared to his other works and especially to Symphogear that I couldn't enjoy it, even after waiting a few months and watching again <br><br> Never actually played any Ace Combat games </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> felt so horridly watered down compared to his other works <br><br>What this about? Who? Did I miss something?</br></br></br>  <br>Gurren Lagann - 8/10<br>MGR - 9/10<br>KLK - 5/10<br>Ace Combat - 7/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are KLK and Symphogear created by the same guy, or did I misread your post?</br>    <br> might be <br>And Homura IS 0% human. What's your point?</br></br>  <br>MGR seems like the perfect Tsubasa game.<br> cut up noise and other monsters <br> superhuman stunts <br> boss battles have your theme song with lyrics popping up at the finales <br>Only need to add attack cards when you do a special attack.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> -Gerren Laggan <br>Imaishi is just fucking garbage at storytelling. <br> -Metal Gear Rising: Revengence <br>Not Platinum's best, but still enjoyable.<br> -Kill la Kill <br>Terrible. All the stuff I hate about Imaishi in one show.<br> -Ace Combat Games <br>Never played them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm probably in the minority, but KLK felt watered down in comparison to Gurren, PSG, and Dead Leaves.<br>Can't really explain it properly, but it didn't feel like there was as much feeling put into it or something pretentious like that<br><br><br>You misread it, I meant to say it that felt watered down in comparison to Symphogear, as well as his other works</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka's suffering wasn't as dramatic and hard hitting as YuYuYu's. In Madoka, character's got the salvation of death, some pretty early, and therefore can't be subjugated to more suffering, but the Yusha's had to live on, each suffering for themselves and eachother.  DID YOU SEE MY AWESOME FIGHT?  Even with their daijoubu ending, YuYuYu was better.<br>Rebellion's only quality as a chinese cartoon movie, is being aesthetically pleasing.</br></br>  <br>TTGL - 6.5/10<br>MGR - 3.5/10<br>KLK - 6/10<br>Ace Combat - N/A</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The offering system is gone, but that also means that the protection from the fairies is gone.<br>The future lies in a mass-produced system that has more heroes which are less mighty and more vulnerable.<br>There's tons of suffering potential in there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Suffering for the girls was kinda the same. Turning into witches vs. becoming a full on cripple is equally shit. Although if post anime yuyuyu actually got rid of all the sacrificial lamb stuff aside from the usual child soldier danger then the wraith filled Madoka world is more shit.<br>If you take the whole state of the world as we know it into account though, then Yuyuyu definitely wins on the suffering scale just for being indefinitely on the brink of full annihilation.<br><br><br><br> Nice.  <br>I should finally start reading them. Although does this just concern Yuuna or is it implied that this will be a side effect for all the Yuusha who got something back?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>11Eyes had more suffering than Madoka. G'enei too but sadly it was retconned in the end.</br>   YuYuYufags actually think their show is better than Madoka   <br>That wouldn't even be much of an achievement.</br>  <br>I want them to leave.</br>  Can we please talk about Symphogear again?  <br>Tsubasa a perfect</br>  <br> MGR 3.5/10 <br> 3.5 <br>Well that is a first for me.</br></br></br>  <br>I know I'm in the extreme minority and I can easily see why people loved it, but I myself just...didn't.</br>  <br>Symphogear virgin here. She seems to be best girl from that image. Is she bullied for her bust size? It is important.</br>  <br>More suffering != better show.<br>Madoka had a flawless story.<br>Symphogear is still better than both combined.</br></br></br>  <br>In universe or the fandom?</br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br> Officially she is a B81 though... </br>  <br>Tsubasa is pretty best, but everyone else is too.<br>Full scan of this when?</br></br>  <br>Im universe, no. Fandom, occasionally.</br>  madokafags pls go  <br> Perfect <br>While she's the best Sympho, I wish she was  more  flat</br></br>  <br>We are just Aoifags.</br>  I'm glad that even in a symphothread we can all agree that Pleiades &gt; symphogear &gt; yuyuyu &gt; madoka.  <br>No.<br>Symphogear &gt; *</br></br>  <br>But does pleiaedses has mechs?</br>  <br> Madoka had a flawless story. <br><br>No. It was a cop out from a good ending into more grimdark shit that became Rebellion and which ended even worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Are we really so bored that we have to start this kind of shit now?<br><br><br>Does car advertisement count?</br></br></br></br>  <br> symphogear &gt; yuyuyu &gt; madoka &gt; pleiades <br>Now it's correct.<br><br>Only really fault of Pleiades to be below all other shows is that main girl has a boy love interest who looks like a girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Does car advertisement count? <br>It didn't have any though. It has astrophysics though.<br><br><br>And unlike any pairing in any of the other shows they actually kissed. Having a guy who looks like a girl kissing another girl is the closest you will ever get to a yuri kiss in any of these shows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How was the original anime a cop out from a good end? The movies were shit and Rebellion a simple cash grab and sequel hook that has yet to produce a good follow up and I hope that no one actually means those when they talk about the series.</br>  <br>If there's really nothing to talk about until we get for information, there is no need to start this shit. <br><br><br>Completely disgusting /u/ mentality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if the car can transform into a bipedal robot.</br>  <br>I thought their staffs, brooms, whatever were kinda related to the cars or something?</br>  Stop talking about other shows you fucking faggots.  <br>Be the change you want to see</br>  <br>They were, but apart from the car-sounds they made it never played any role. It never tried to advertise anything at all.<br><br><br>By leaving Homura behind and putting her into another stupid world where she had to continue fighting. Madoka should just have taken her with her when she became a goddess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine. Lets talk about why FIS is better than the original trio.</br>  <br> Only really fault of Pleiades to be below all other shows is that main girl has a boy love interest who looks like a girl. <br><br>Yeah, that was some pretty shitty pandering a whole useless part of the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> I hope that no one actually means those when they talk about the series. <br>No, don't worry, they don't.<br><br> Yeah, that was some pretty shitty pandering a whole useless part of the anime. <br>I really honestly hope this is supposed to be sarcastic, and not a serious post, because this shit is faceook-tier.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pandering <br><br>Stop using words if you have no clue what they mean.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck does this even mean?</br>  <br>Surprisingly, I unironically agree.<br><br>Maria, even in her normal 'boring' state, is someone I would really enjoy spending time with, and when she's faking her cool persona she's great to watch. I like how protective and caring she is, both in general and towards the two idiots, and I don't mind her being cowardly, as her less active approach to life is one I myself prefer over, say, Hibiki's.<br><br>As such, because I'm just as boring etc as Maria, it comes as almost no surprise (despite my usual hatred of lolis and lolifags) that I really really like both Kirika and Shirabe. Yes, Shirabe is currently my least favorite of the GEAHs, but not only is it for completely understandable reasons, but I can see her getting quite a bit better with some more time in the spotlight. Kirika, on the other hand, is pretty much the best kind of child a parent could ever hope for, and given my strong desire to be as good a parent as possible, the DESSfag easily skyrocketed to the top for me.<br><br>That's not to say that I have anything against the main trio though, as Tsubasa and Chris are both very well written and exceptionally lovable in their own right, and I would currently put them tied at second best. Hibiki, on the other hand, just doesn't cut it for me currently, and I really hope that won't damage my enjoyment of GX.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Re-birthday that aired on Ayahi's radio show is not full version.  <br>Still want to hear it.

I think I'd put YuYuYu a bit above it though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pleiades was great <br>I don't deny that, still it didn't move me as much as Madoka or YuYuYu at the time when it aired, and wasn't as guilty fun as Symphogear was every season.<br><br>Still better than Wixoss, Precure series or that tarot card magical anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I'm not really feeling it yet. Meteor Light is still the best.</br>  <br>http://a.uguu.se/cvnhst.mp3</br>  <br>It was probably because Pleiades is actually a mahou shoujo played completely straight, which is really rare these days outside of Precure. There wasn't any suffering outside of maybe episode 10. The series is worth watching just for Stella-rium though.<br><br>Wixoss had potential but there was just too much stupid shit for me to enjoy it completely, plus they didn't focus enough on why Ruu was so obsessed with battoru. And Spread was retarded. Both seasons had god-tier OPs though.<br><br>Haven't watched Precure but I heard that Heartcatch was the darker and edgier season that's been a tough act to follow, and the subsequent seasons have been mediocre or otaku-pandering like Smile. <br><br>CHICKEN SALAD had some good ideas and designs that were ruined by a retarded committee, and I don't think it was ever able to shake off its status of "Madoka ripoff" like YuYuYu was able to. It's kinda sad that the producers were clearly expecting it to become a big hit.<br><br>Also to keep it Symphogear related:<br>Synchrogazer &gt; Exterminate &gt; Vitalization</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing it did better was characterization.</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br>I liked the premise of the suffering more than "Aliens need little girl suffering energy". Also the world was more interesting as well.</br>  <br> Heartcatch was the darker and edgier season <br>That's the stupidest shit I've read all day</br></br>  <br>Genei had actually been in development since before Madoka. Whether the entire story was planned before Madoka or after/influenced by it is unknown. As for YuYuYu, even the staff said it was compaired to Madoka a lot and so they had to try to be different. The only reason people don't call it a Madoka ripoff that much here is because they think it is the new and improved Madoka and therefore the greatest thing ever.</br>  <br> The only reason people don't call it a Madoka ripoff that much here is because they think it is the new and improved Madoka and therefore the greatest thing ever. <br>Haha, oh wow.<br>People like this exist?</br></br></br>  <br>YuYuYu was actually better than Madoka in some ways though (mainly characterization) and it actually doesn't share much with Madoka besides suffering and some slightly similar character designs.</br>  <br>Yuyuyu played up it's Madoka similarities and used them to set up plot developments that people really didn't expect.</br>  <br> I've read loose summeries based on questionable translations  <br> tells others to read the LN  <br><br>Don't bring that shit here, YuYuYu has a thread up all the time if you want to shitpost.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, they were so unexpected they ruined the whole thing.</br>  Can Yuyuyu fags discuss Yuyuyu in Yuyuyu thread?  <br> YuYuYu has a thread up all the time <br>Really? Fucking cancer.</br></br>  <br>I liked the premise of Madoka more than "God takes away bodily functions chosen by the writers for suffering". The imouto losing her voice just felt too manufactured. So, opinions I guess.<br>The world was more interesting, I'll agree, but Madoka was never about that. But sure, I'll give you that one.</br></br>  <br>Because both don't have yellow senpai-type characters that go crazy when they learn the truth, right?<br><br><br>I'm surprised there isn't one up right now. They love to make back to back never-ending generals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>S2 when?</br>  <br>It's mostly YuYuYu haters AKA Madokafags.</br>  <br> The only reason people don't call it a Madoka ripoff that much here is because they think it is the new and improved Madoka and therefore the greatest thing ever. <br><br>So is yucky tuna the hipster Madoka of Evangelion?<br> Also I never really felt the similarities that much, but to each their own if they feel the need to compare every mahou shoujo to Madoka nowadays I'll let them be. </br></br></br></br>  Symphogear - when mahou shoujo gets physical<br><br>Pleiades - when mahou shoujos are all pacifist<br><br>Wixoss - when mahou shoujos tried playing Yu-Gi-Oh<br><br>YuYuYu - when mahou shoujos need to change their smartphone<br><br>Madoka - when mahou shoujo burns out<br><br>They're all about mahou shoujo, turn off your brain and enjoy the girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  SO HOW ABOUT THAT SYMPHOGEAR GUYS?<br>I HEAR IT'S STARTING IN LIKE TWO DAYS.</br>  <br> Symphogear - when mahou shoujo gets physical <br>I want to see mahou shoujo go mental. Anything like that?</br></br>  <br>What a childish mentality.</br>  <br> all the time <br>like once a week maybe.<br>It just looks like there is one all the time because it gets bumped for 3 days.<br>Beside that we all are quite disciplined to do it only once a while</br></br></br></br>  <br>Less than 48 hours now.</br>  <br>I tried saying something, but everyone else was too busy arguing about other things.<br><br>Then again, is there even anything to comment on yet? Re-Birth Day has been uploaded and it's good, but that's about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Wixoss.</br>  <br>Yeah sure, all those yuyuyufags in here are totally just flaseflagging madokafags, right?</br>  <br><br>Just fuck off.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand this mentality at all. Just because you're a huge fan of something, doesn't mean you're required to hate something else which shares similarities or extreme differences<br><br> Madoka haters aka Symphofags <br> MANIME haters aka CGDCTfags <br> Lucky Star haters aka TTGL fags  <br>etc.<br>It's retarded. Pidgeon holing people like this is stupid as fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking more traditional mahou shojou. Like a show where the whole group is like Mami after she breaks, but with their own quirks to set them apart.</br>  <br>/a/utism.</br>  <br>Look at all the "lol they think they're think is better than Madoka" posts. It's most of them.<br><br>Reading comprehension. "Mostly". There's also YuYuYufags.<br><br>Now everybody do this or talk about Symphogeah now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you'd read my post then you'd see that I admitted that the two shows share some character designs, mainly Fuu/Mami and to a lesser degree Tougou/Homura. And even though both Fuu and Mami go crazy upon learning the truth, what they do afterward is different (Mami tries to commit triple murder-suicide, Fuu goes into open rebellion), and Tougou and Homura are completely different characters.<br><br>Also the multitude of YuYuYu threads lately is because there's new material coming out, just like there's more Symphogear threads in anticipation of GX.<br><br>Can't somebody just love both Madoka and YuYuYu? And Symphogear too? Not Gen'ei though, fuck Gen'ei.</br></br></br></br></br>  This thread reminded me that I should watch YuYuYu off my backlog.<br> After I finish Sora no Woto </br>  <br>Insecurity in their own tastes and a need to downplay those who enjoy something else for not enjoying their favorite things instead? I mean, I have no love for Madoka and I used to be that kind of person, but it got pathetic after a while.</br>  <br>Just stop already.</br>  <br>I'm mostly talking about the ones that keep posting shit about people that think YuYuYu is better than Madoka. That's also pretty stupid.</br>  <br> Sora no Woto <br>Great. Can we at least shitpost about that instead?</br></br>  <br>  Not Gen'ei though, fuck Gen'ei. <br>You shouldn't say this just because Gen'ei has the smallest fanbase among these shows anon.</br></br>  <br>Aoi Yuuki once again voices best girl<br> I JOE YOU JOE </br></br>  <br>Go away.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yeah and that mostly is totally bullshit when half of the posts are from Yuyuyufags going on about how much superior their show is. If you faggots want to circlejerk about Yuyuyu that much or start Madoka vs. Yuyuyu shitflinging feel free to make an appropriate thread for it instead and stop shifting the blame.</br>  <br>You could also stop. Just an idea.</br>  <br>I love all 4 and there is nothing you can do about it</br>  <br>Fat ass. I like it.</br>  <br>But Yuyuyu has no Ao-chan.</br>  Describe bikibutt.    Cute girls being cool as fuck is the best shit  Show power rankings aside, we can all agree that Mahou Shoujos are only getting better, right?  <br>Your post implies a power ranking.<br>Just fucking stop.</br></br>  <br><br>Jew Ginka was best gen'ei, you know you can't prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br>I still love Cardcaptor Sakura, but yeah I agree.</br>  <br>Round, firm. Absolutely 10/10.</br>  Between<br> mahou shoujo that punch, kick, wrestle, haymaker, dropkick, club, slash, headlock things up close and personal <br>and<br> mahou shoujo that shoot, snipe, blast, nuke, pulverise, evaporate, disintegrate things magically <br><br>which one do you prefer  both isn't an option </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to use it as a pillow</br>  <br>Mecha musume isn't mahou shoujo for me.</br>  <br>The latter, simply because there's more versatility and I find it more interesting. In the end it's not going to matter as much as the characterization, the world, the overall story and the way all 3 are presented.</br>  <br>Second.</br>  <br>I'm not implying by the season, they get better, just in general, from the last 5 years.</br>  <br>Magical beam attacks are pretty boring.</br>  <br>But one without the other is boring.</br>  <br>This anon gets it.</br>  <br>The latter when most of the fighting is going on.<br>The former when shit gets real.</br></br>  <br> 5 years <br>Tiny sample. Worthless trend.<br>You'll have to be more blatant in your shitposting.</br></br></br>  <br>The power of interpretive ballet dancing.</br>  <br>Regardless of how long or short that amount of time is to you, the trend is being set with each and every show and there is nothing you can do to stop it. At this point it could take a series of total garbage mahou shoujous shows in a row to break the trend. Not even the shit that is Pisma Illya can stop true Mahou Shoujous.</br>  <br> Prisma Illya <br> shit </br></br>  <br><br>Nobody cares.</br></br>  Radiant force &gt; Exterminate &gt;&gt; Rebirth-day  <br> Mecha musume isn't mahou shoujo for me <br><br>This take your guys magical girl shitposting elsewhere this is /m/ territory.</br></br></br>  <br>Plebs can't handle the lolis.</br>  Why are you guys saying that it starts in 2 days? Isn't the air date suppose to be July 4?  <br>It's July 2 in nipland</br>    <br>Remember timezones and the japanese 24 hour format tv time listing? That's why.</br>  <br><br>Lolis are fine, but Prisma Illya does a terrible job at it's cute/girly/SoL side of it's anime. And the rest was only alright. Fight scenes were cool in season 1, mana transfers were cool in season 2. That's about it.</br></br>  <br> cute/girly/SoL side <br>How so? I mean there isn't really that much SoL anyways.</br></br>  <br>Yes.

It was simple to find.</br></br>  Reading what's out for this right now, it's obvious that MC-kun knows whats going on and doesn't want anyone stepping in on his deal.  <br>This is where you learn it's bi-montly, there are no raws (even if it's a webcomic), the scanlators have listed it as stalled and the author has put it on hiatus because he's got a very serious cold. <br><br>This is the path of the manga reader.</br></br></br>  This guy is either the densest asshole in existence, playing dumb on purpose, or is in extreme denial. I have no idea which it is.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127441905 <br>No one here cares if they're popular.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127441905 <br>Just stop before your embarrass yourself any further.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127441905 <br><br>Stop shitting up this tomboy thread</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127441905 <br> anons <br> wanting to be popular or social <br>You're probably the type of person with facebook.</br></br></br>  <br> This is where you learn it's bi-montly, there are no raws (even if it's a webcomic) <br>Shit, couldnt they set up a tip jar or something to buy them?

He's doing it because he likes it.<br><br>Why can't he like hanging out with her as she is and as their relationship is? Maybe he doesn't want a girl who acts girly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Playing dumb, but for what purpose?</br>  <br>It actually updates every 2 days or so with a new page.<br>And there are raws on the author's twitter and website.</br></br>  <br><br>He obviously thirsts for blushing awkward Tomboys, he'll do anything to bring out the blushes</br></br>  <br><br>Jesus Christ, that guy gives no fucks about pushing a girl into the rain.<br><br>But that's what happens when you pull the kind of shit she tried.</br></br></br></br>  Fuck, and I thought being Osanajimi-zoned and Friend zoned were bad enough. Being in bro zone is probably the end all, be all of zones.  <br><br> author has a very serious cold <br> Japanese <br><br>RIP<br>I<br>P<br><br>He won't make it to the end of the year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pushing a girl in the rain <br> In japan <br>Fucking Christ, thats like attempted murder over there. I bet she got the cold and nearly died.</br></br></br>  <br> pushing a girl into the rain. <br><br>Considering how deadly a Japanese Cold is, it's almost like he tried to kill her.</br></br></br>  <br>But she acts like that all the time.</br>  Everybody who enjoys this should check out Himegoto.  <br>ONE OF US ONE OF US</br>  <br>more than just getting his dick wet, it's more about keeping a companion that he enjoys to be with<br><br>I'm sure he's scared about turning it into a romance because of what would happen if it doesn't work out. There's no need to rush since it's probably better to wait until after high school so their hormones have calmed down a bit already (high school romances rarely work out well).</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying whoever enjoys cute tomboys must like dicks?</br>   tomboy suffering <br><br>OP, don't ever read Umareru Kachi.

He doesn't have a single negative quality, except maybe selfishness, but even that pales in comparison to Luffy's own.</br>  Is Sabo the worst character?  <br><br>Then fuck off.</br></br>  <br> over 18 <br> on 4chan <br>wow you are doing something wrong with your life  just like I </br></br></br>  <br>yeah, maybe you should leave to some other place that is less shit<br>see ya</br></br>  <br><br>You're in the wrong place m8.</br></br>  <br><br><br>no</br></br></br>  <br><br>I guessed that was the reason, but it wouldn't be the first thread shitposted by the OP that reaches the 500s</br></br>  <br><br>Then there is little use complaining.</br></br>  <br>you're right<br><br>i'll stop complaining and also take a page out of your book by deflecting all criticism as well</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good.</br></br>  <br>Just lurk a bit more before posting, it's really not that hard</br>  <br> fujo <br> tumblr gifs  <br> is an annoying faggot with no regards to board culture  <br>yep</br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS<br><br>YES</br></br></br>  <br><br>mods are persnickety sometimes</br></br>  <br>this place is shit anyway, why complain?</br>  <br><br>Because you are making it better, so fuck off.</br></br>  <br> complains <br> why complain? <br> shit place <br> Imma stay <br>Stop trying so hard, this is the only feeding you'll get.</br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to the Oro Jackson?

It happens occasionally in Hunter x Hunter, but only to real dickheads, or if the guy doing it is sort of a dick himself. If someone shows bro potential they have a real chance of walking, however. Some characters are also soft, or can be. (Although clearly, not all the time. Killua will pull peoples heads off, but he's learning to make the choice not to. Although, observe how well controlled his father is and how he fucking ganked Cheetu. He squashed him like a bug.)<br><br>The Spiders of course, are also clearly quite ruthless although they have elected to walk/let other people walk, too. (Gon, Kil, still breathing, etc.) Some more than others. Some of them are fucking insane even by Hisoka or Illumi standards. (other examples. Hisoka lets worthy opponents live, people he thinks are annoying little bitches, he slaughters.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want a protagonist with no honorable goals?<br><br>While both pirates and marines are made up of good and bad people throughout, the huge difference is that the leading pirate figures are good guys while the leading marine figures are bad guys (morally, I mean).<br><br>Garp and Aokiji were the only good people at the top at Marineford and they were both disgusted with how things went down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with that ? Did you expect him to drink shark juice instead or something ?<br>They just picked him up as a child. We don't know anything else.</br></br>  <br>false reports get you banned, you know</br>  <br>I wasnt that guy, plenty of people answered him as I was chewing you guys out</br>  <br> Luffy being the greatest marine <br> not Ace </br></br>  <br><br>Wasn't false though. <br><br>Announcing does though, but I couldn't give a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you</br>  <br> board culture <br><br><br>it was false though. The picture isnt nsfw.

It's just an oversight, yeah, but usually Oda pays attention to small details like that.<br>Or have we had any reliable information on how young fishmen grow up?<br><br>Also, does Dellinger imply that some mermaid got shagged by one of these battle fishes?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If my boss saw that pic, he'd fire me on the spot.</br></br>  <br>They're fishMEN. They obviously eat anything any other man does.

You and your “brothers”…!!<br>Sabo: ?!<br>DenDen Mushi: Brrrr</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>you dont get to define what nsfw is because you dont like it, m8. There's nothing lewd in that picture, you're just reactionary</br></br>  <br><br> there's nothing lewd in that picture <br><br>I'm happy I don't live in the US.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ZEHAHAHAHAH</br>  <br>Great... Ace got captured because he didn't want to actually kill black beard.</br>  <br>Fishmen are mammals, word of god.</br>  <br>Why is there no DRAGON INCOMING hype? Its probably Koala but people were convinced the shiny lights from the teardrops were from Kizaru</br>  <br>I'm so glad we didn't have to see this fight</br>  <br> I'm over 18 <br>So are the vast majority of One Piece readers. 60% are over 30.</br></br>  <br>If that were true, why does Oda continue to write it for 12 year olds?</br>  <br> what is WSJ? <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br><br>It is still a Shounen Jump publication - you don't bite the hand that feeds you.</br></br>  <br>What magazine do you think this is?</br>  <br>It's easier to keep on writting a story for weekly 12yo readers who pay for WSJ and keep the +18 fans with boob-growing/sexual inuendo and buyfag material. Marketing at its finest</br>  <br> Implying it won't be shown in a flashback next week. </br>  <br>It's like the biggest manga of all time, if his audience truly was mostly adults, he wouldn't have to stoop to such lows just to keep himself fed.</br>  <br>What lows?<br><br>One Piece is still generally the same as it's always been.<br>Do you want his crew to be murdering people left and right because they're pirates?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Oda does with One Piece exactly as he wants.</br>  If FI is the halfway point, and right now we're generally at ch 800, we have 400 more chapters, give or take, until the series is over.  <br><br>That same audience keeps reading though.<br><br>If it ain't broke, don't fix it - Oda doesn't care about some whining neckbeards on a Vietnamese imageboard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>great, only 3 more arcs at this rate</br>  <br><br>*cartoon.</br></br>  <br>OP is a static manga, it doesn't grow with the audience. That's part of it's success, it makes the standards even on a progressing story, so there's less room for disappointment or error.</br>  King Neptune is best king<br>Queen Otohime is best queen</br>  <br>I just wish he hadn't reset everything with the timeskip as to keep catering to children. It's ruined the whole arc of the series because he didn't want the series to mature with its audience.</br>  <br>dellinger is HALF fishman, half human, and we don't know if fishmen drink milk or not, they are humanoids after all</br>  <br>This isn't a place for new fans to educated. This is a place for autistic faggots to read too far into every little detail of every chapter, and spew bullshit about our waifus.<br>lurk more faggot</br></br>  <br>This is fact.</br>  <br>Whut. The reason for the timeskip was the defeat of the SH pirates and the death of Ace. How isn't that maturing? The timeskip was necessary for the crew to gain a logical power boost. How else would zoro learn haki? From trying it?</br>   reminder that the doffy vs luffy fight is almost 4 and half hours long <br> entire dressrosa arc is longer than the lord of the rings trilogy  <br><br>I'm going to hang up one piece until the series ends and marathon this shit for two weeks, got the time off work ready to go.<br> my bosses faces when I explain why I need two weeks off </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool blog man, where do I subscribe?</br>  <br> spending 8 years away from One Piece <br>I don't know how I could handle it.<br>All the fucking spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't go necessarily say the series needed to mature after the timeskip, but following up the most serious, high stakes arc (which had been steadily built towards) with everything Fishman Island was was a bad move</br>  Which part of One Piece brought the heaviest feels to you?<br><br>Pic related.</br></br>  <br> and spew bullshit about our waifus. <br><br>Im down for that</br></br></br>  <br>Garp prequel would be interesting. Seeing Roger conquer the unconquerable for no other reason than because he said so. <br><br>No fancy fruit powers, no power ups, no yelling your attack names, no relying on armies of fodder. Just a good old fashioned ass beating with fists.</br></br></br>  <br>do I have to remind you that hachi owns a takoyaki restaurant?</br>  <br>I mean the tone of the series itself, you dumbfuck. Everything was maturing until we got to the timeskip and clearly Oda thought the series was getting too dark because he reset it (getting rid of a lot of character in the process) to be carefree and took away all the seriousness and actual struggle.</br>  <br>spoilers ar not suposed to have nsfw pictures idiot, they are suposed to have spoilers, this is a blue board</br>    <br>This, Whitebeards eulogy, the Strawhats defeated. "I can beat you", <br><br>I love the flashbacks but the few present timeline feels moments get me much more.

The fight is because Merry is too broken and has to be replaced but Ussop is being a little bitch about it. So Luffy beats the fuck out of Ussop and abandons the merry.<br>Some guy named franky will show up and he will join the crew.<br>Robin will say she wants to leave but then the SH will get her back. <br>Luffy has 2 new special attacks that are somewhat like super saiyan.<br>Gear 2 and 3. Gear 2 makes him very very fast.<br>Gear 3 makes his fist or leg giant.<br><br>At the end of ennies lobies the crew is stuck there and the government is about to start a Buster call (basically they nuke the island) and the Merry saves the crew. Merry gains sentience for some reason. Then merry dies and Franky makes a new boat called the Sunny.<br><br>After ennies lobies they will go to thriller bark where there will be a skeleton and he's like alive and shit and he was part of the crew that Laboon. And so in this arc Luffy fights another warlord called Moria and beats him by eating a bunch of shadows and getting a powerup. Brook (The skeleton) then joins the crew. Nothing happens with Zoro<br><br>After Thriller bark they end up going to Shapondy archipelago where they have to get their ship coated to be able to go to fishman island and then the new world. Once there they meet a bunch of rookies that set of on the sea at about the same time as Luffy and that have been causing a ruckus like Luffy.<br>Luffy punches a Celestial dragon and the government is like oooooh fuck no and so bartolomeu kuma shows up and sends the whole crew to different parts of the world and Luffy cries like a bitch cause he couldn't defend anyone.<br><br>Wanna keep talking about this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>took you long enough<br><br> i dont know how to screencap </br></br></br>   OP threads forever ruined with homoshit   <br>These 3 panels: http://www.mangapanda.com/103-2534-<wbr>12/one-piece/chapter-427.html</wbr></br>  <br>Merry's funeral. I was okay until Oda pulled the "I'm sorry... I wanted to carry everyone further" and I was a mess of tears.<br><br>Second place goes to Roci's death. The panel were Law's cries start having sound again is heartbreaking.</br></br></br>  <br> they are suposed to have spoilers <br> read the note of the global rule n°5 faggot <br><br> &gt;Spoilered pornography or other "not safe for work" content is NOT allowed on the work safe boards <br><br>why are you pointing this out to me?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We all did it faggot. Lurk moar b4 u post.</br>  <br><br><br>So once the whole crew is separated Luffy ends up on the island of Amazon Lilly where he meets another warlord. That warlord is Boa Hancock, the most beautiful women in the world. Luffy falls into her shower and discovers her terrible secret: she used to be a slave.<br>Then shit happens and Luffy learns that Ace is about to get executed.<br>Ace is the guy you meet briefly at alabasta that is luffy's brother. Turns out he is one of the commander of one of the 4 emperors of the sea. That emperor being Whitebeard, the strongest man in the world.<br><br>So Luffy is like oh no got to save ace so he asks Boa who has fallen in love with him to help him infiltrate Impel down. Impel down is the world's most secure prison and nobody has ever been able to escape from it. Except for one dude that was almost as strong as Gol.D roger.<br><br>So Luffy manages to enter Impel down and he wants to get to the bottom floor to rescue Ace cause ace is a dangerous criminal and thus places in the bottom floor.<br>Luffy meets Buggy and Mr 3 in the prison as well as Bon clay, crocodile and mr 2.<br><br>Before reaching the bottom floor he gets rekt by the prison warden Magelan that has a poison power paramecia.<br><br>Bon Clay manages to save Luffy by escaping to a secret part of the prison where Ivankov, the right hand of Dragon the revolutionary (Luffy's dad) has created a safeheaven for okamas. Ivankov saves luffy and decides to help him save Ace.<br><br>They get to the bottom floor but Ace is already on his way to his execution that is happening at marineford.<br><br>So they then free all the prisoners and escape. the prison but Bon Clay stays behind in order to allow them to escape.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy gets sent into an island full of women, and their leader starts lusting after Luffy's cock. Luffy finds out that Blackbeard caught Ace and gave him to government so he became a Shichibukai. Luffy then hitches a ride with the sexy leader who also happens to be a Shichibukai as well, and they're summoned to fight Whitebeard in an all-out war because he was like "Hell no you can't execute my son".<br>Then there's hijinx at a huge prison. There's a poison-guy and this other guy who's the best character ever. We meet several other people like Buggy and Baroque Works top dogs again. <br>Then Luffy almost dies. Several times. Good thing there's this huge fucking faggot who brings him back to full strength, and yet he can't save Ace from the prison in time. So he escapes with 200 or so other prisoners, making him and Buggy the biggest criminals on the whole thing.<br>Then there's a war at Marineford. Nothing much happens, except that Ace and Whitebeard die, Blackbeard appears with a brand new crew filled with the most dangerous people from the prison. Ace gets fisted to death and BB and co shoot WB to death. Then Shanks appears and is like "Yeah the war is over". Luffy cries like a bitch and THEN Rayleigh appears and says "Hey Luffy, let's train for two years".<br><br>Insert timeskip here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hey will that cool ice guy show up again? <br><br> &gt;how dare you ask questions! Now im going to copy and paste the wiki summary to try and prove a point instead of just answering 'yes' or 'no' </br></br></br>  Is sabo confirmed? i guessed it would be a sabo chapter.  we getting an early chapter?  <br><br><br><br><br>Alright so Luffy has escaped impel down now and is header to marineford where the biggest war is about to happen. Whitebeard is going to go get ace back. But the marines want that to happen cause it's a chance to kill whitebeard.<br><br>and well <br>this<br><br>So then after the war is over and Luffy is healed he goes back to marine ford to cause a ruckus to let his crew know that they should take 2 years to train on their own before meeting up again.<br><br>Then they meet up again at shapondy archipelago?<br><br><br>Dude you said you wanted to discuss the manga. I'm discussing it.<br><br>Please feel free to ask more questions.<br><br>So anyway they all meet up again and they're like super strong cause you can see them one shot a robot that gave the whole crew trouble 2 years earlier and then they head off to fishman island.<br><br>When they get to fishman island they meet a group of fishman that hate humans and want to do bad stuff so Luffy beats their boss and we discover that the princess of fishman island is one of the world's ultimate weapons poseidon. She can talk to sea kings and have them do shit.<br><br>So then after fishman island the gang heads out to Punk Hazard where THE ICE DUDE and the lava dude that was also an admiral duked it out during the 2 year timeskip and the island is now forever half frozen and half on fire.<br><br>So there they meet Trafalgar Law the dude who saved Luffy's life during the Marineford war and he's a warlord now. So stuff happens and they capture this mad scientist that is like making drugs and that also works for Doonxiote DOflamingo, another warlord.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dude you said you wanted to discuss the manga. <br><br>literally where?</br></br></br>  <br> this huge fucking faggot <br>Best part is that it's absolutely correct.</br></br>  This could be the worst One Piece thread I've ever seen<br><br>REMOVE TUMBLR remove tumblr</br></br>  <br> Please feel free to ask more questions. <br><br>So do you suppose Buggy and Shanks fulfilled ALL Cabin Boy duties on the Oro Jackson?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>i dont mind the homoshit as long as people aren't arguing for no reason</br>  <br><br> <br><br><br>So Law proposes an alliance with Luffy in order to take down an emperor.<br>That emperor is Kaidou and to take him down you need to take down doflamingo.<br><br>So they head to dressrossa in order to fight doflamingo but when they get there the whole plan goes badly and they have to improvise. <br><br><br><br>RIght there.<br><br>So anyway they make it to dressrossa and well the new admiral fujitora is there<br>as well as Burges one of the dudes on BB's crew.<br><br>So shit happens and Dofla gets BTFO like a looooot of times and now we think he's finally down.<br><br>Oh I forgot that at some point after ace dies there was a flashback that reveals that Ace and Luffy aren't real brother but more like how black people use the word brother and they had another brother called Sabo who supposedly gets blown up in the flashback but it is revealed that he is actually alive and the 2nd in command in the revolutionary army that Dragon (Luffy's dad) runs.<br><br>And well Sabo gets ace's fire powers and is fighting Burges. So now we're wondering if he beat burges or not.<br>There you're all caught up you little piece of shit.<br><br><br><br>No. I believe that they did no cabin boy work except for the occasional sweeping of the floor.<br><br>This is a shonen manga not some ecchi gay shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God that looks horrific</br>  <br>Obviously Shanks did, why else would he have such an emotional attachment to Roger?<br><br>Buggy seems to just remember his past bitterly but maybe he serviced Rayleigh as he didn't seem to have a negative opinion on him.</br></br></br>  <br>just try and ignore them and hope they don't explode into tumblr tier shipping and general fujo-shit</br>  <br> RIght there. <br><br>that lack of reading comprehension. Have fun I guess</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can't not almost cry whenever I see this part again.</br></br>  <br>You were complaining that we didn't let new fans talk about the series.<br><br>Well I told you everything about the series. Now you have no grounds to complain.<br><br>And since you're caught up you don't have to ask retarded questions like: Is x going to show up? I'm too dumb to keep watching the anime. Also also too dumb to read the manga so I have to watch the anime instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sorry... I wanted to carry you all further </br>  <br>I always figured Buggy was a nickname for his true job and he just got attached to it<br><br> but maybe he serviced Rayleigh <br>this is my newest ship actually.  Bad Touch Rayleigh is best Rayleigh </br></br></br></br>   i-it's just chapter release day! I swear threads will get better!   <br> You were complaining that we didn't let new fans talk about the series <br><br>that translated to summarize everything? Well I guess all we have left to talk about is speculation<br><br>Such as wondering why Whitebeard surrounded himself with boys</br></br></br></br></br>  Since this was a shit thread anyway I thought i'd ask. Anyone know of an old anime where kids raised monsters that fought each other and if they died they turned into round tablets?  <br><br><br> being this autistic </br></br></br>  Abandon thread, I'll see you faggots (the non-gay ones, that is) when 792 comes out  <br>LOOK AT ALL THESE GUYS!</br>  <br>that sounds like Monster Ranchers? It's been many years so i'm not 100% on that</br>  <br>Monster rancher maybe?</br>  <br><br>Thats it, thanks.</br></br>  <br>Don't expect the threads to get any better,last time there was Rebeccafag</br>  <br>All. These. Guys.</br>  <br>Where's whitebeard in your image?</br>  <br>I liked the peter pan guy, too bad nothing came about it.</br>  <br> look at all these nurses who just so happen to be women! <br><br>you're adorable</br></br></br>  <br> Wanted to take out his little brother <br> Sent his big brother to his execution <br><br> Doesn't finish him off <br> Nor showing any anger or resentment <br><br>Sabo is disappointing.He doesn't have to kill Burgess but come the fuck on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Where's whitebeard in your image? <br><br>in his chair probably?</br></br></br>  You will now remember Bogart  <br> peter pan guy <br><br>who?</br></br></br>  <br>He sliced up Coby's pistols, and beat Cobymeppo up. That's it.</br>  <br>That shark guy looks so out of place there</br>  <br>thats why he was forgettable still seemed like a cool guy</br>  <br>Namur has to be one of my favorites BECAUSE he's so out of place</br>  <br>He's the coolest one, I wanna know more about him. He doesn't seem to give a fuck, but must have quite a few tricks up his sleeves to be one of Whitebeards top guys.</br>  <br>The one in old European clothing thats right under the person who fought mihawk</br>  <br> first reply <br><br>this. fucking this. every arc has some point where everything comes full circle and this is literally the best one. ill see how dressrosa is once i re-read it though, just because kyros' story gets to me.</br></br></br>  <br>nigger, the anime is great up until thriller bark, in fact until the colored scans came out the most recommended way to experience wanpiss was to watch the anime up until the end of water 7 or thriller bark then switching to the manga</br>  <br>No the best way to watch something is to watch/read the source material.<br><br>So no matter what you say the anime will always be inferior to the manga.</br></br></br>  STOP THE PRESSES, SEAKINGS ARE REAL AND ONE WASHED UP IN RUSSIA<br>https://archive.is/Buido</br>  <br>What? No.<br>Just read the fucking manga.</br></br>  <br>I was disappointed to find out Haruta wasn't female but Oda just couldn't have one strong female character that didn't look like a hag, his explanation for why there were no women fighting at Marineford in Whitebeard's crew is pathetic and exactly the sort of disgusting shit that leads to worthless characters like Rebecca</br>  <br>except the scans were shit until skypeia after which they became shit again<br><br>holy fuck go back to reddit, you reek of new</br></br></br>    <br>Not buying the manga.<br><br>Don't complain about free stuff you fucking thief.</br></br></br>  <br> Not owning all the tankobons. </br>  <br>I'm really hoping we see Isho again on Wano. At the very least they'll find someone who knew Ace from the time he was there. Luffy needs to run into one of the Whitebeard allies sooner or later</br>  <br> https://archive.is/Buido <br>I love shit like this</br></br>  http://vocaroo.com/i/s0o5Dzbt8wOU<br><br>prepare your dick</br></br>  <br> Don't complain about free stuff you fucking thief. <br>If someone gave you an actual pile of shit for free you wouldn't complain?</br></br>  <br>If someone gave me shit by force I'd complain.<br><br>If I tried getting something that cost money for free and the only thing I found was shit, Then I wouldn't complain.<br><br>See the difference?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ecky things <br>Does this bitch not know that ecchi is supposed to be a belittlement of hentai?</br></br>  <br>oh Haruta<br><br>I didnt know he was peter pan themed. That's kind of neat</br></br></br>  <br>I dont think he is I just didn't know his name.</br>  From what episode is this screenshot?<br>It's when Luffy leaves Amazon Lily</br>  <br> not knowing the names of characters that were never named in the story <br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  <br> fucking a corpse </br>  <br>That's not Amazon Lily you fucking retard. But it's from whatever episode is the first one after the timeskip.</br>  <br> I'm really hoping we see Isho again on Wano. <br><br>I never even thought this was a possibility<br><br>I really hope this happens now.  What if the mystery samurai the Kin'emon and Kanjuro were travelling with was Izo? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I'm not even close to the timeskip yet but the video I watched said it was Amazon Lily<br>Thanks anyway</br></br>   Oda is a Cameron Mitchell fan   <br> know most of them by name <br> cant remember what most of them do <br><br>I SWEAR Thatch is a cook but I can't find any information to back it up but I SWEAR</br></br></br></br>  <br> cook <br>Try 4th division commander.</br></br>  <br>The island is Rusukaina. It's close to Amazon Lily</br>  <br>Isho's childhood sketch has him dressing as a girl and his father (?) looking extremely distraught. I think the reason his uses guns is just to spite samurai tradition. He either lives there as an outcast or not at all, but I really want the former. The perfect straw hat allies are outcasts and weirdos</br>  <br>No yeah I KNOW that but he's also a cook<br><br>somehow<br><br>I think I convinced myself he's in Chef Whites but maybe he's just dandy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the characters in One Piece are pretty lame, Oda isn't that great a writer, he's just been better than the average shounen writer</br>  <br> his shirt is blue <br>I think you need to quit while you're ahead.</br></br>  <br>What was his explanation?<br><br>And really, what do you expect from a Jap doing a kid's action series?<br>Oda doesn't even know that Chicks actually Dig Giant Robots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>perhaps but that shirt looked white to me<br><br>Has Thatch been in any official color spreads?</br></br></br>  <br>He said they purposely left all the women at home because of muh chivalry even though the women "begged" to come along. Meanwhile, some of his allies were women but they were ugly (and not actually in his crew) so they were allowed to fight.<br><br>The reason the question came up was because someone wanted to know if Haruta was female. He could've just said yes and retroactively made the story a little less childish but he didn't.</br></br></br>  <br> Whitey Bay <br> ugly <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>It seems to be some sort of common misconception. There was some idiot asking how the Amazons were able to live on an island with animals powerful enough that they Luffy had to use the King Kong Dong. The island with the animals is uninhabited because of those animals. It's where he spent his time during the time-skip with Rayleigh and it's the only time anyone is known to be on the island.</br>  <br> He could've just said yes and retroactively made the story a little less childish <br>How would that have made the series less childish?</br></br>  <br> but they were ugly <br>I do not believe this nigger is serious.</br></br>  <br> &gt;they purposely left all the women at home because of muh chivalry even though the women "begged" to come along. Meanwhile, some of his allies were women but they were ugly (and not actually in his crew) so they were allowed to fight <br>Hah, what the fuck?<br><br>Oda really is a fucking Sanji. Its pretty laughable.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder Akainu's magma is hot enough to evaporate steel<br><br><br>He made the nurses stay home because they're fucking nurses. His crew is all men because he's an old queen</br></br></br>  <br>The anime design was alot uglier/shitter than the manga version, but you can say that about the op anime in general.</br>  <br><br>Whitey bay isn't part of WB crew,she's just an ally</br></br>  <br><br>Forgot about her. She doesn't count as she didn't actually participate in the fighting (in view). She just had a ship that was useful as a plot device for a brief moment.<br><br>He has lots of attractive women that are presumed to be capable of fighting but we never see them do it unless its just fanservice shit like Kalifa.</br></br></br></br>  <br> some of his allies were women but they were ugly <br> here's an ally who was a woman but wasn't ugly <br> b-but she wasn't part of the crew! <br>Dude, what?</br></br></br></br>  <br> He has lots of attractive women that are presumed to be capable of fighting but we never see them do it unless its just fanservice shit like Kalifa. <br>Wasn't Boa wrecking Pacifitas and pushing in Smoker's shit during Marineford?<br>Yes, yes she was.</br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't count because.</br>  <br>She's literally the definition of a fanservice character (though I do admit it's cute).</br>  <br>because she's a complete counterexample to your entire argument?<br>Okay, we'll leave her out then.</br></br>  <br> everyone who replies to my posts must be the same person I was talking to before </br>  <br> got Luffy into ID <br> told Ace about Luffy <br> got Luffy Ace's handcuff's key <br> saved Luffy after MF <br> protected Luffy during timeskip by hiding him away <br> helped him set sail right after TS <br> will probably help again in future if not show up to fight alongside him <br><br>Total fanservice tier 0/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You really didn't get that I was on your side here? The whole "because, period" bit didn't clue you in?</br>  <br> makes orgasm noises when hugged </br>  <br> you can't infer stranger's motivations on the internet because there is a . at the end of their post?! </br>  <br>You're mixing that up with Rebecca.</br>  <br>Look at the sentence. Look at it. It just ends where the actual "argument" should be. Do you know why? Get what I was saying?</br>  <br>it was pretty obvious by the way he replied</br>  <br>If you're Waifu would jump out your monitor to hug you, you'd do the same.</br>  <br> was going to let her entire country be burned to the ground until a man asked her to help him instead <br> got mad at other people for stealing the affections of this man who had no interest in her <br> did whatever she could to please this man despite him constantly telling her no and not even knowing her name <br> jumped into the fray when people were about to hurt the man that keeps her alive <br> would literally die, in story, if she were to stop lusting after this man who has moved on and forgotten her already </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*your<br>Fucking hell.</br></br>  Have we gotten any more spoilers?  <br>this is why I can't like Boa<br><br>she could have been badass WITHOUT lusting after a man to the point of stupidity</br></br></br>  <br> no wings <br>Fucking disgusting.jpg</br></br>  Do you think Luffy will ever be considered/consider himself as/claim the title of a yonkou?<br><br>I honestly don't, both for in-universe and for narrative reason.<br><br>The narrative reason is that then no one would underestimate him anymore, and enemies underestimating him is kinda part of the whole deal.<br><br>The in-universe reason is that Luffy would likely consider it as some kind of pattern somenone wants to force himself into, someone like the world goverment. And Luffy wants to be his own thing, or something.<br>He would either not accept the title, or not care about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's wasting no time in the power/territory bullshit. If it happens it happens, but he's mainly going straight for Pirate King and a damn good adventure. Although I am sure down the line things will no doubt get political.</br>  <br> LOVE IS A HURRICANE!! </br>  <br>Well, in that scene it was literally impossible to have her as purely fan service, she was supposed to do _something_. So she got to beat up a vice admiral. (Weird how she didn't lose the title of Shichibukai afterwards.)<br><br>Her other fights are stuff like getting acid-undressed by Koume/Kotake.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he'd care in the slightest, but the way he's gathering allies and territory and poised to take out Big Mom and Kaido, he'd be a de facto Yonko. Only thing is the story moves too slowly in-universe for that to even matter.</br>  <br><br> being a cocksleeve for the winning gladiators after their matches <br> sometimes becomes a cocksleeve for looser gladiators so they won't feel so bad <br><br>Rebecca is far too important to just be fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Yonko is just something that gets assigned to you.<br><br>There's always the possiblity of Luffy taking them ALL out and being the Ikko.</br></br></br>  <br> Sanji said this to Zoro before their first fight <br><br>Boa's character is still dumb</br></br></br>  Why do people think Lola is Big Mom's daughter? Because she called Big Mom "mama"?<br>Well, all of Whitebeard's crew called him "pops".</br>  <br>goodness is it time to get lewd already?</br>  <br> im a what? <br> i dont care about that, call me what you want <br><br>this is literally what will happen<br><br>strawhats are just blundering their way to world domination</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wouldn't make any sense. He's going to be the Pirate King, he will abolish the idea of Yonkos. The Yonkos exist because none of them are making a move for the One Piece, Luffy won't be content to just sit around owning stuff. He wants freedom.</br>  <br>probably the haircolor, lips and proportions?</br>  Guys!<br><br>Guys what if<br><br>Re D. Shanks<br><br>?!?!?!?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ugly as fuck <br> said her Mom was a big deal in the New World, her crew fervently insist on this too <br> started in the New World and left for Paradise <br> Vivi card would be a defense against Big Mom's wrath <br><br>However there's also this</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you bought all of the tankobons <br> implying your not caught up with the series because you only read the paper material <br>gtfo</br></br></br>  <br> not Redhair D. Shanks </br>  <br>The life card she gave the crew is a pretty obvious set up for something.</br>  <br><br><br><br> Are you really doing this?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not Re D. Hair D. Shanks </br>  <br>you mean Shanks D. Red</br>  <br><br>this all hinges on whether or not big mom could get a guy to have sex with her.<br><br>and i find it hard to believe they would rather have sex instead of being killed outright to fuck that thing.</br></br></br></br>   People forgetting Kai D. Ou   <br>Even if Lola isn't her daughter, Bonney most definitely is. They have the same ship design</br>  <br> Nami has Lola's card. <br> Currently facing Big Mom <br> They have to get saved somehow if not by Monet </br></br></br>  <br>Cry more. Mods have deleted your tumblr pics in the past.</br>  <br> &gt;They have to get saved somehow if not by Monet <br>disgusting anon</br></br>  <br>I'm not even a monet fag, but she is a logia user, why wouldn't she survive the stab?</br>  Zoro's final enemy won't be Mihawk. It will be a Stairs Stairs fruit user  <br>Well, those stupid snow bunnies with the Sunny weren't placed there by Oda for no reason.</br>  <br>1 she wasnt expecting it so she couldnt dodge, and second he would use haki since he thought that was smokers heart and hes a logia too.</br>  <br> why wouldn't she survive the stab? <br>because we literally saw blood coming out of her heart. Which did not happen to any logia user before. She's dead. And why the hell would she show up on Big mom's ship and help the strawhats who are the enemy's of her master instead of trying to get doffy out of there? Are you underage?<br><br><br>what?</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127446136 <br>I did not imply that she saved Sanji or something, that is retarded. Just asking why everyone is 100% sure a character in One Piece died, and, well, you convinced me.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127446136 <br>Did we get an explanation for those yet?<br>And if you dare say they don't look like her Snow Rabbits, I call bullshit on you.</br></br>  <br>People thought it was a signal for enel since hes on the moon.</br>  <br> Cry more. Mods have deleted your tumblr pics in the past. <br><br>they havent though. Not once</br></br></br>  <br>Anon are you a legit autist? Why would her logia DEVIL FRUIT powers have any influence on the water? We literally got the explanation that the weather and the water in the new world does whatever it wants to do. This image has nothing to do with monet.</br>  <br>And appetite.</br>  <br>Denial.</br>    <br> delusion <br>It would make no sense for monet to follow the strawhats like that and to do nothing until now after arriving in dressrosa. So fuck off with your fanfiction.</br></br>  <br>The arc is over and monet never appeared, that water is just water.</br>  <br>The user just can't swim. It's not like water negates any powers, Luffy could still stretch while being submerged (arlong park)</br>  <br>Also aokiji froze the sea</br>  <br> Weather and water does whatever it wants. <br> No, they just look similar by chance! <br><br>Also, :<br> Oda stated in SBS that Devil Fruit users are susceptible to all types of water, not just seawater. This includes the white sea surrounding Skypiea. He elaborated on this, saying that "moving" water, like rain or waves, does not weaken Devil Fruit users, while standing water does. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Plus when he and Robin saved Usopp from falling out of the sky.</br>   DIE FOR ME MONET <br> gets ready to blow herself up <br> gets stabbed in the heart first and dies explicitly on screen <br> hasn't come back for over a hundred chapters now <br><br>its oda's fault for not killing characters cause hes breeds logic like this, but i think shes really dead this time. he dropped his batman rule for new world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> snow can remain it's substance on water and act on it's own following a ship, because it has it's own mind <br>wow anon<br><br><br>nice strawman, but aokiji had no influence on the water itself. He couldn't make ice spots on the water, he had to do a whole road and even said that it will return to it's normal state on it's own. So he couldn't make the ice grow larger o anything after freezing the sea ones.<br><br><br>So if luffy would have jumped from the boat he could swim, because it's moving water, you prophet?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No other counter-argument?Kay.<br>Glad to see you ain't got shit to disprove it other than being assblasted.</br></br>  <br>Only if they have physical contact with water. They are able to modify even water with they abilities unless they touch it. Just see how Kuzan froze the entire bay at Marineford.</br>  <br>And you literally have nothing to prove that monet lives, because even your bunnys don't look the same.</br>  <br>Oda's own words.Waves don't negate DF powers.<br>Problem with that?Write to Oda.</br></br>  Post yfw Dresrosa is almost 1/8 of One Piece.    <br>I think he's implying if someone on the shore or their ship got hit with a wave, they wouldn't lose their powers immediately. Though that would also imply that if someone somehow threw seawater at a Devil Fruit user (which people propose all the time), it wouldn't work.</br>  <br>Then you really need a pair of glasses or stop being in such denial.</br>  <br> Waves don't negate DF powers. <br>I'm 100% sure that your post has a shit translation, post the raw with an accurate translation or suck a dick. Waves or not, DF User can't swim.</br></br>  <br>I don't see the problem.</br>  <br>you should look at the images you posted first and stop your delusion.</br>  <br>So how assblasted are you gonna be when she never makes another appearance? You know, because she's dead.</br>  <br><br>How are waves not standing water?You can't be in a wave without being in the ocean. Does he mean getting splashed by a wave?</br></br>  <br> &gt;men dont wear these things! <br> fuck you dad! <br> &gt;men use swords not guns <br> I said Fuck You dad! </br></br></br></br>  <br> men use swords not guns <br>I can think of a few people who would take offense to that remark</br></br>  <br> nice strawman, but aokiji had no influence on the water itself. He couldn't make ice spots on the water, he had to do a whole road and even said that it will return to it's normal state on it's own. So he couldn't make the ice grow larger o anything after freezing the sea ones. <br>Are you for real ?<br>Or course ice will return to water because, i don't know, it melts ?<br>Fucking retard i swear</br></br></br></br>  <br>those look like perona's hollows</br>  <br>All of america ?</br>  <br>not all of it, just the south<br><br>maybe Nevada</br></br></br>  so /a/, here is the burning question<br><br>Who will be the next Strawhat?</br></br>  <br>You missed the point retard, he couldn't make a specific spot to ice in the middle of the water, the ice was conected by two islands and even then he couldn't move it after taking his hand of the water, so there is no way that your deadfu monet could make snow bunnys that move around at there own inside the water retard. If that was possible Akainu would make a lava soldier army passing the water to kill filthy pirates you retard.</br>  Reminder that we have already seen kaido .  <br>Jinbei.</br>  <br>None of those guys. They'll be part of Luffy's armada.<br><br>Would not be opposed to Barto joining even though I think his schtik would get old fast</br></br></br>  <br>It's Bartolomeo.</br>  <br>If it's not Ucy, there is no god</br>  <br>Moocy obviously</br>  <br>Well, explain me how he uses his bike on the sea, then. Are you even reading the manga ?</br>  <br> implying everybody's schtick in the crew doesn't get old fast <br>You could have probably said the same about Brook.</br></br>  <br>barto as the ship's cabin boy. franky will even build a little cuck shed for him.</br>  <br>where are Abdullah and Jeet now?</br>  <br>Yeah, there's multiple Straw Hats with more annoying schticks that are horrible characters when used too much, like Sanji for example (or really any of the Sunny crew).</br>  <br>his ice remains connected to the island he leaves from, retard, he can't be thrown in the water and suddenly freeze the ground water to stand on it</br>  <br>they were just random shadows from a sky island</br>  <br>I think Bedroom is actually funny though.<br><br>Also I already saw his character in that one guy from Hitman Reborn and it was annoying there too</br></br></br>  so are you guys ready for the last big reveal this arc has to offer?<br><br> Luffys attack was intense <br> fuck <br> It was so intense it knocked some sense back into Doflamingo <br> we see that his left eye is missing <br> he now remembers that he was tortured brutally by some world nobles <br> his "father" adopted him out of pitty <br> Doflamingo colapses physically and mentally because he lived a lie <br>The next things either happen after that or in a cover story<br> Doflamingo and all of the relevant others are rescued by Pica who brings them somewhere safe due to his ability <br> After Doflamingo wakes up he is a mental wrack <br> He begs Sugar to turn him into a toy <br> Pls erase my existence I want a new start <br> "and so the puppeteer becomes the puppet" <br> ODAAAAAAA <br><br>Pic also related, we might get to know soon who's behind Mr.Store too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;he now remembers that he was tortured brutally by some world nobles <br> &gt;his "father" adopted him out of pitty <br>I'm pretty sure that's fucking dumb</br></br></br>  <br>that's some fanfic tier writing right there if that was the case.</br>  spoiler when?  <br>  Right now.  </br>  <br>That was much earlier, this is right after Thriller Bark. We don't know what the fuck those things are, and it was implied they were responsible for ships disappearing in the Florian Triangle prior to Moria arriving. I don't think for a second it's Kaidou though, as it was stated this has been happening for a long time.</br>  <br><br>the eye theorie is haunting this board for a while now though. I myself don't really believe this will happen but something's telling me Oda might be stalling this one out until chp. 800 so he seriously might start another Doffy flashback</br></br>    <br>Oda can easily stall this out without adding another flashback</br>  <br><br> Law tries to kill Doflamingo  <br> edgy edgy edgy reeeeeeeeee <br><br> Sabo lets Burgess go <br> sabo is disapointing, most OP characters are pretty lame anyways, Oda isn't even that great a writer </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is Issho is kawaii?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it wont be anything though, I believe that this is a thing japanese usually do with horror movies, where after all is done and the evil is defeated you learn that the real problem is still there and will continue to fuck people over.</br>  Hoping at the end of this arc we get some reveal of the void century/will of d./one piece plots  <br>He's an  Admoeral .</br>  <br>I think I like that idea more than some arbitrary explanation that its a sea monster, or Sky Islanders shadows or whatever theories exist</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure we'll never hear of this ever again in the story. Probably just an easteregg to add mystery into that mysterious part of the sea.</br>  <br>Makes sense considering the whole arc was just about using horror movie tropes.</br>  <br>that was terrible<br><br>points for effort though</br></br></br>  <br>We'll probably have to wait until the end of the arc where Jinbe joins, then "oh robin I found this thing bet you all forgot the poneglyph"</br>  <br> Doesn't finish him off <br>Maybe therevolutioners doesn't want a fight with BB at this moment.<br><br>inb4 Teach would laugh like this<br> Boss, Burgess got rekt <br> Zehahahaha, that was his fate! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that was terrible <br>That's probably the reason I didn't dare to post a pic of Carlos with it.<br> points for effort though <br>Thank you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I always wondered - why does Moocy have two asses on his face?</br>  <br>nigga what?</br>  <br>All that bullshits got to come out somewhere.</br>  <br>can't unsee</br>  <br>Pretty sure he will take his time wrap up this arc. It has been quite long. CP0, Partying, Character reactions, end of Doffyrosa</br>  <br> Moocy <br>It's Ucy, you faggot!</br></br>  Dentist anon, I believe you have some shopping to do.  <br>Seriously, why did people start calling it Moocy as if Funimation's subs haven't been wrong before</br>  <br>It'll have a huge impact on the story later on.</br>  <br>Hey, calm down, I was just going by that anon's post, since I forgot the bulls name myself.</br>  <br>Moo+Ucy?</br>  <br> that image <br><br>that shit is the stuff of nightmares</br></br></br>  <br>Original japanese name : Ucy = Ushi = cow + pun on Lucy.<br>English translation : Moocy = moo + pun on Lucy.</br></br>  <br>Is that why he's so  admirable? </br>  <br><br>Its the same pun but translated to english</br></br>  <br> it'll be Cowsy by the time Dressrosa is dubbed </br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan. I mean what else is the strongest organism alive. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. Think about it, when drake was a kid he served a man who was weaker than him. Ants are usually weaker than dinosaurs. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports the theory of kaido having an ant zoan.  <br>Maybe, I would pressure as much.</br>  Why are the Dressrosa side characters (apart from Barto) so bad?  <br>That's about as plausible as him having a Godzilla zoan because Godzilla vs King Kong.</br>  <br>lots of theories going wild there mate.

His father Barrels was a marine officer, and Drake dreamt to become a marine while he was admitting his father. But something happened and his father became a pirate, and used violence even on his own son, he really became a cruel man. Drake believed in his Dad and followed him, he was 19 years old at that time. Yet he, who feared his own father, looked much younger. And then Drake was protected by the marine and became one himself. Despite him being able to make it up to a marine officer, he dropped his career and became a pirate. What did happen to him!?

The Director's Cut of ToD PS2 came out a year before Graces on Wii. The story was alright, but I think Destiny has one of the more interesting worlds where the series takes place. The characters are also really good. It deserves an adaptation merely because of how fun it is to play. No other Tales games even comes close.<br><br><br>Yeah. She's basically Richter/Flynn. I don't mind though, Zesteria looked really bad from the get go. You know it's the same recycled fucking story and with Graces-like combat, which really wasn't all that fun. The graphics are pretty fucking shit, since they emulate the Graces PS3 style; I find it sad that the best-looking game, and best game in general, since they got on the 7th gen is Vesperia. A fucking 2008 game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Japan hates Zestiria after Onibaba lies<br><br>Onibaba didn't even go to Tales Fest this year because he was afraid, kek</br></br>  <br>I mean that was basically Xillia and it was fairly well received.<br><br>This is of course ignoring the symphoniafags and the vesperiafags that won't ever fucking shut up.</br></br></br>  <br>ToD DC was overrated. 2nd part of the game is a huge snorefest. Not to mention muh Hugo-sama wanking.</br>  <br>Tha's our main character in fusion mode.</br>  <br>Symphonia is shit but Vesperia deserves all the hype, it is objectively the best tales game.<br><br>Even the xbox version with less content is better than every other tales game, the ps3 version is just extra</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like if they wanted an anime adaptation of a Tales game then Vesperia would be their safest bet, just going by the game's overall popularity world wide. But from what's been said so far, it looks like they are trying to fix the grievances people have with Zestiria since ufotable has stated outright that they are changing the story. <br><br>As for ones I'd like to see, well again Vesperia just because I happen to be really fond of that one. I think Xillia would also be okay just because I think it would fit ufotable's style more than say Symphonia, plus they've already shown through the cutscenes that it would look pretty decent.</br></br></br>    Would love a Xillia adaptation.<br> Dat Sawashiro <br> Dat Yonaga <br> Dat sexual tension <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/-K1SY6RqZyY?t=10m3<wbr>2s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Graces-like combat <br>There's a small but vocal minority that are just fucking obsessed with graces combat, as if limiting arte chains with every character is a good idea ever.</br></br>  <br>They had security fit for terrorism threats at this years TalesFes.

You'd think since the story was about him getting over his obsession with Millia and creating his own life goals that he would drop his crush on her too. But instead they made it so that Milla suddenly recipricated it in the end.<br><br>Not that I'm complaining, just that it felt like an odd direction to go, almost like the writers change their mind midway through.<br><br><br>That's messed up anon, talk about kicking them while they are done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>being leia is suffering, lost to a woman literally created by god in the image of his dead waifu</br>  <br>Nice to see the best girl win for once,</br>  I just want more Ludger.  <br>There's actually nothing pointing to Alisha being a prominent heroine. Anyone who thinks otherwise is looking for a scapegoat or is a waifufag.<br><br>That said, removing her from the main game is pretty retarded and an obvious cash grab move.</br></br></br>  <br>Except Jude's arc was figuring out what it is he wants or is fighting for and gaining some fucking self confidence, not getting over Milla, and what he really wants is, well, Milla.</br>  <br>That's because Jude's whole character is Muh Milla and making her like him back was easier than giving him some character development.</br>    <br> There's actually nothing pointing to Alisha being a prominent heroine. <br>They even put her as "main heroine" at Tales mobage just to changed it when fans start revolting.</br></br>  <br> There's actually nothing pointing to Alisha being a prominent heroine. <br>The cross over game team that apparently never talked to the team doing the game labeled her the Heroine. Not the Main game team's fault</br></br>  <br>  But instead they made it so that Milla suddenly recipricated it in the end. <br>It wasn't really that sudden when you think about it. She started to doubt herself halfway through the game and her reasons for fighting changed from<br> MUH DUTY <br>to<br> Oh shit, I'm a faker but I have to uphold the idealistic image Jude and everyone else has of me <br><br>Their relationship never really felt like an overt romance you'd find in something like Graces, but a bit more subtle and fairty-tale like like in Vesperia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I was actually hoping Ludger would hook up with Leia. </br>  <br>I'd say it was just really poor marketing on their part. While they never explicitly said whether or not Alisha was a prominent character or not, there was a lot of promotional material that gave that impression to the vast majority of people.<br><br>Plus there were a lot of things pointing towards a sudden change in the story midway through development. Stuff like how Rose's voice actor recorded her lines a whole year after the other voice actors did. <br><br>While I do agree the outrage was a tad too much, it's hard not to think that something was going on during the development to make this clusterfuck happen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It feels like there was some huge miscommunication between the developers and the marketing team somewhere along the way.</br></br>  <br>Leia is a shit who doesn't deserve him.</br>  <br>And Alter did the same. No way both would just put "main heroine" in her description without getting info about her from Bamco.</br>  <br>"They" as in whatever the creators of the mobage were. Cross-overs have minimal involvement by the original party - it's the company with the cross-over that handles the data and mechanics for gameplay.<br><br>Same thing with collab events like other mobage involving AoT and F/SN.</br></br></br>  <br>Any healthy guy would be distracted by Judith's Judiths. He's probably bi.</br>  <br>You got that backwards</br>  <br>Ludger has a crush on Muzet though.</br>  <br>Cease your lying, Leia was lovely.</br>  <br>True, that's a good way of putting it, but it still felt a bit sudden to me personally since Xillia's ending didn't really give me that impression while Xillia 2 just outright put it out there.<br><br><br>I always saw it as him making his own motivations since, prior to his development, every thing he did in the story was based around what Milla wanted to do rather than his own desires. <br><br>They did well in that department for the most part, but I thought him growing out of his somewhat childish crush on Milla would have been a good concluding note on that part. But that's just my personal opinion on it. <br><br><br> Jude is a shit who didn't deserve her <br>Fixed for you, and this is coming from a person who actually liked Jude as a character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Muzet is a crazy weirdo who is full of Gaius and Jude's mana, she is unworthy of love.</br>  <br>I hope if they do reuse the song they'll at least make a decent video this time<br><br> 90% of it is ugly ass CGI <br> anything that isn't is either just a really shitty shot or barely animated at all <br>How did they fuck up so bad after Xillia and 2's great OPs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dat jacket off.<br><br>Scratch that. ALL the jacket off for the chicks.<br><br>Especially Milla's coupled with bunny ears.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She was a useless piece of trash and the most pointless.</br></br>  <br>There was romance in Vesperia?</br>  <br>Of course there was.</br>  <br>N-no it isn't, you bully.  The world the story takes place is in is interesting, and the characters are nice too. The story's meh, but all Tales stories have been thus ever since Phantasia. <br><br><br>I knew about that, but didn't know it actually worsened the situation. Even though I haven't played anything past Graces f, I will say that Xillia 2 looks really fun to play. <br><br>And the writing thing varies. As I said, the Tales team just rehashes the Phantasia story; the main antagonist is always a tragic villain that merely didn't think of the solution the protags did. Anyways, my point is that the games aren't hard to write. Or at least not much effort is put into the story. <br><br>Symphonia was a prequel to Phantasia, and Mithos is one of the more evil antagonists the series has had. Most laud the game because it was their first Tales. Not a bad game, but not incredible in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>I didn't like Abyss that much, but I always hear this from hardcore fans: great story and great characters. I think the story is the same old rehash, but with a nice twist. I can't stand the characters, though. <br><br>Vesperia was a really generic story, in all honesty. What made it so good were the characters. There simply hasn't been a cast as charming and entertaining as the Vesperia cast before or since that game. Makes me feel sad that Hubert got stuck in such a shit game like Graces.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/u/ please go.</br>  <br>abu</br>  <br>I don't think it was making his own motivations so much as affirming that he has motivations of his own (even if they do originate somewhere else, sorta like Shirou's ideal being borrowed from Kiritsugu but still being his own ideal all the same in UBW) at all rather than just being dragged along by Milla or whomever else.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ve4<wbr>LqfqpdSE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Hey /a/, anyone played Vesperia PS3 English patch?<br><br>SUCH A GLORIOUS EXPERIENCE WITHOUT SHITTY ENGLISH DUBS TO RUIN IT</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=MB4<wbr>bvAK__Ks</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Why is this the best Tales OP in recent memory?</br></br>  <br>I really like Yuri's Dub VA. Would go GAR.</br>  <br>Say what you want about the game but Symphonia 2's OP was pretty good. Probably my favorite.</br>  Can we all agree that, characterization aside, Jude's fighting style is great? he is basically a RO monk and I love it.<br><br> Best tales OP <br>That's not Karma.<br> in recent memory <br>oh okay, then yes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mithos <br>I want to  impregnate  Mithos.</br></br>  <br>The impression that I had while playing ToV in japanese was that Estelle had a crush for Flynn, which eventually became a crush for Yuri, which never really became a thing.<br>I'm not really sure if it was their intention or if it's just me, but I kinda liked that, including the fact that it never really became a straight out romance.</br></br>  <br>Man, Ufotable's work is so much better than Production IG, it's so much better animated then the last game with IG's shitty animations, Graces F<br><br>Wished Ufotable would reanimate Vesperia's anime scenes</br></br></br>  <br>Can't unsee now anon, not even mad</br>  I suspect that they'll have Grandia-tier baby making time after Jude complete his research.  <br>Actually Vesperia is one of the few games that I don't mind the dub.<br>Like, every character voice fits perfectly, and Karol is going to sound annoying no matter which language.</br></br>  <br>I got to that conclusion too and I only ever played the English version. I'm pretty sure it was meant that way which I'm ok with as well. It's rare to see JRPGs actually play around with that route without going through with it all the way.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=T3i<wbr>ujMV0jyA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Xillia/Xillia 2 UNDUB is the only way to play it to enjoy GLORIOUS MIYUKI SAWASHIRO and SUGITA voicework</br></br>  <br>If you really think that about Abyss give it another play through, preferably on NG+. It really shines when you're actively paying attention to little details you may have missed the first time around. <br><br>And the writing thing really doesn't vary, at least not nowadays. Occasionally they put some effort in but then they decide to rushcthe game out for some reason and everything gets fucked up a la Xillia but most of the time nowadays they just don't even fucking try, see Graces and Zestiria. <br><br>'Tragic antagonist who didn't come up with the protagonists' solution' is such an oversimplification I can't even take it seriously. You can't just boil down a story to its most basic plot points and compare it to others and you're not even doing that, you're going further beyond and distilling the games' narratives to one trope present in some of them. <br><br> Vesperia was a really generic story <br>Yes it was, and it was all over the place with what it actually wanted to be. Writing isn't just confined to story though and those characters you were charmed by are the product of decent writing, something the series hasn't seen since Vesperia. <br><br> Hubert was a good character <br>I don't even know how to reply to this. I could've understood Malik, but fucking Hubert? Coming from someone who didn't like Abyss' characters?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The dub for Vesperia was great.</br>  <br>Who did Vesperia? I don't remember it being that bad.</br>  <br>Production IG<br><br>Vesperia isn't bad but Graces F is terrible</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see much wrong with Xilia's characters. The only issue is that the plot kind of went all over the place in the latter half of the story.<br><br>Jude and Milla both had amazing character development and I actually learned to like them by the end of their stories.<br><br> Jude turns from an indecisive kid into someone who punches out a FUCKING GOD <br><br>Like holy shit, I don't understand why people rip on the guy. He went through a lot of shit and came out of it badass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> characters you were charmed by are the product of decent writing, something the series hasn't seen since Vesperia. <br>Only Destiny, Vesperia and Symphonia were good. The rest were shit or mediocre at best. Don't make it sound like the good ol days were a lot better. They weren't. We are long overdue for another Tales game with good characters though.</br></br>  Why does /a/ always have the best Tales thread?<br><br>/v/'s threads is nothing but shitposting every fucking time</br></br>  Friendly reminder that Milla tried to breastfeed baby Jude.  <br>/v/ used to have amazing Tales threads last year complete with actual valid criticism of Vesperia and Graces, the two 'babies' of the franchise.<br><br>Then we ran out of things to discuss and they died only to be followed with Zestiria shitposting.</br></br></br>  <br>Personally I just didn't see any of the development you speak about, his only motivation is Milla. He just parrots Milla's ideals by the end of the game and in Hamil he was a fucking mess that didn't even want to eat because waah Milla.<br>He is a character type Yonaga have done in the past and not really the best example of it. If you liked him that's cool but in my case it felt like everyone talked more about how capable and mature he was than him actually being so.</br></br>  <br>Phantasia was decent. Destiny did everything better.<br>I hope the new Star Ocean will be decent. But we will see.</br></br>  This thread isn't making me look forward to Zestria when it comes out in Oct. Is there even any romance in it besides him being homo with his spirit?  <br>This is Tales 'they won't even kiss but they love each other we swear' romance so you could interpret it as them just being friends, anon. Personally I preferred this combination.<br>On other romances Rose and the wind spirit guy are kinda close?</br></br>  <br>I gave it 3, back in '07. I liked Guy, like everyone else, but the rest of the cast were really asshole-ish. Especially Tear and Jade; they are the ones that gave Luke the most shit, even though they fucked up pretty badly themselves. I might emulate it, but I don't really want to extend my backlog. <br><br>I know I oversimplified it, but it always ends up the same way. Sure, the majority of the story is different, but the villain is always the same.<br><br>I do admit that there was decent writing in Vesperia when it came to the characters. <br><br> Malik <br>Nope. He got everything he fucking deserved. He was a fucking pussy, and he suffered the consequences. And yes, I loved Hubert's character. He was the best thing out the shit show that was Graces. He was a way more fitting protagonist than Asbel (though I do admit this isn't hard to be), he taught himself to fight like his favorite superhero and even created his own weapon, and he confessed to the girl he liked. Pascal was also quite alright, but the rest of the cast was nowhere near as good. Especially not Malik. His past wasn't tragic, he failed to step up to the plate and got BTFO. <br><br>And what does my liking Hubert have to do with Abyss characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Star Ocean 5 <br>Apparently the protag for the new game will be from an underdeveloped world like 1.</br></br>  <br>From what I've heard secondhand, it looks like they were going for the Yuri route with Rose and Alisa for some bloody reason.<br><br>Ufotable has stated that they plan on changing the story quite a bit, and going from the previous animated special they made they might be shippers of MC and Alisa. So who knows how it will go down at this point?</br></br></br>  <br>Xillia's protagonists were excellently written. It's a shame the same can't be said about literally any other character in the game, especially the Chimeriad. Almost every bit of information about them is divulged in missable skits and even then there isn't much to them. Wingul is a fucking 12 year old edgy weeaboo who goes SSJ and starts speaking a foreign language when he turns off his limiters. Jiao was okay, mostly because we learn more about him through his in-game conflict than through whatever little we hear about his past. <br>The worst offense in the game by far is Gaius. He's so ridiculously uncharismatic and brutish that it's insane to expect anyone to accept the characters hailing him as a great leader. He's built up to be a wise man, incredibly powerful, incredibly smart and every other trait you'd find in a Mary Sue aside from being an actual writer's self-insert and he's so fucking stupid and obstinate he refuses to back down from his plan when it's not at all too late and the protagonists are shoving a perfect solution that could potentially make everyone happy without having to annihilate the population of an entire fucking world. Thus we have a final boss who by all rights shouldn't be fighting you. <br><br>Really that last complaint I have about Gaius is more of an issue with the story. The game would seriously benefit from the last third or so not being insanely rushed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Friendship only</br>  <br>sauce</br>  So I heard in Xillia 2 the new MC pretty much wins the Milla bowl. Is that true? I don't think I could take the NTR.  <br>Jude starts out as someone who doesn't know what he wants to do in life so he blindly follows his father's path despite not getting along well with him. He latches onto Milla because he was charmed by her grace and majestic aura, but stays with her when he realizes she's caught up in something big. He comes to idolize her because she's a strong person with a clear goal in life and the resolve and willpower to achieve it; in short Milla is literally everything Jude wants to be. He has bit of codependent issue and by hanging onto Milla, he can feel like he's doing something good.<br><br>Milla, for all her autism, actually realizes that Jude doesn't know what he wants and is only following her for the wrong reasons. She tells him several times to figure out his own path and will await his decision. When Jude begins to figure out that Milla isn't all she seems to be, he has a bit of a crisis: continue supporting this person who is no more than a tool and a faker to be used in an evil grand scheme, or to abandon her and follow his own path? He ends up not choosing and when Milla bites the dust, finally begins to think for himself. This is why he goes to Maxwell and punches the shit out of him for answers - signalling his ability to finally move on from Milla's shadow and by extension, overcoming his codependency issues.<br><br>His character arc can be seen most clearly in the ending chapters on Elympios, where it is Jude who takes the initiative to push for Spyrite Research, something Milla was vehemently against. He stands up to Milla and convinces her this is something worth pursuing, reversing their roles where it is he who gives her a reason to keep fighting after she lost her way. In ToX2, he ends up doing what he enjoys for his own reasons, not for anyone else's.<br><br>This is character development.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a different Milla anon</br>  <br>I think we reached a low for the series with Xillia 2. It can't be worse than that.<br><br><br>Thank fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Two Millas.</br>  <br>Guy technically speaking gets the girl at the end of Xillia 2 at the very least. She just literally never shows up until the ending though. <br><br>Better than homo end at the very least.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Nothing happens, Alisha is shit and underpowered, recycling everywhere <br> &gt;Special artes? What special artes? <br> &gt;yfw when it's episodic DLC <br> &gt;yfw you have to pay more for it <br><br>But we got Alisha and Rose being all lovey dovey</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> thank fuck <br>Yeah I was getting tired of them always being from developed worlds too. Really they should have alternated the protags backgrounds instead.</br></br>  <br>The developers admitted that they fucked up with S04 and that SO5 will be nothing like it. I like they can admit their mistakes unlike Baba.</br>  <br>Yeah, the boss fight with Gaius always felt forced to me. Both sides pretty much came to an understanding before then but it was pretty much just Gaius who was refusing to budge from his extremist path.<br><br>It's dumb as fuck because right after you beat them, everyone becomes friends again anyways.<br><br>What the fuck?<br><br> Although given the rushed ending, I'm not sure how they could've ended the story properly .<br><br><br>Fractured!Milla is a different Milla.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, curious to see how that happens.<br><br>Wait, don't tell me, does Milla  die and get replaced by a new spirit Milla, thus Jude hasn't won the Milla bowl in Xillia 2?  I don't think I could take that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://taleslations.tumblr.com/post<wbr>/49180144790/birthofmillamaxwell</wbr></br>  <br> the Xillias wouldn't work as a traditional adaptation <br>I could perhaps understand this statement for Xillia 2 with its time travel shenanigans and Ludger, but the story is still in a pretty linear order so would translate perfectly well into anime. The only issue is dealing with Ludger since the silent (or in NG+, near silent) protagonist concept doesn't work nearly as well. <br><br>The first Xillia would work just as well as an anime as any other Tales game though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They failed with the whole silent protagonist for Ludger, who ended up having a surprising amount of personality compared to most of the cast.</br>  <br> Tales has always been fujobait central, Anon. <br><br>Otaku really fucked up supporting that harder then</br></br></br>  <br> Parallel worlds, </br>  this thread is so much better than the unmitigated disasters of tales threads in /v/ and /vg/<br><br>seriously this is blowing my mind</br></br>  <br>The only SO I have a problem with is 3. 4 had issues but it didn't want to make me kill myself like 3 did.</br>  <br> Alisha and Rose being all lovey dovey </br>  <br>Could you write something like this about Alvin?</br>  <br> it didn't make me want to kill myself like 3 did. </br>  <br>You might have problem with 5 since the developers are using 3 as the base.</br>  <br>So does the original cast not really come back, then?<br><br>This doesn't seem very sequely.
