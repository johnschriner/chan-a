[ Alright /a/<br>How do we kill the Accelerator?</br>  We wait until he dies.<br><br><br>Tehehehehehehe.</br></br></br>  We make him read those shitty Index novels.  <br>What do you mean how do we kill him? Shoot him in the head before he can turn on his computer thing.</br>  By asking the author  <br>Can Accel even deflect Madara Uchiha WINKS? And I'm not talking about Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara. No, I'm not talking about Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara. Hell, I'm not talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara either. I'm talking about Kono Yo no Ky?seishu Futarime no Rikud? Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan (which is capable of Enton Amaterasu, Izanagi, Izanami and the Tsyukuyomi Genjutsu), his two original Rinnegan (which grant him Chikush?d?, Shurad?, Tend?, Ningend?, Jigokud?, Gakid?, Ged?, Bansh? Ten'in, Chibaku Tensei, Shinra Tensei, Tengai Shinsei and Banbutsu S?z?) capable of using Katon, F?ton, Raiton, Doton, Suiton, Mokuton, Ranton, Inton, Y?ton and even Onmy?ton Jutsu, equipped with his Gunbai(capable of using Uchihagaeshi) and a Shakuj? because he is a master in kenjutsu and taijutsu, a perfect Susano'o (that can use Yasaka no Magatama ), control of both the Juubi and the Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA and face implanted on his chest, his four Rinbo Hengoku Clones guarding him and nine Gud?dama floating behind him AFTER he absorbed Senjutsu from the First Hokage, entered Rikud? Senjutsu Mode, cast Mugen Tsukuyomi on everybody and used Shin: Jukai K?tan so he can use their Chakra while they are under Genjutsu. I'm Talking about sagemode sage of the six paths Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, Rinnegan, Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, and Geass doujutsus, equipped with Shining Trapezohedron while casting Super Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann as his Susanoo, controlling the Gold Experience Requiem stand, able to tap into the speedforce, wearing the Kamen Rider Black RX suit and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju's DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  Nuke him from the orbit. <br>He might not die from the nuke itself but the entire zone is fucked and goodluck getting out of it.</br>  <br>No</br>    Can Accelerator beat DIO?  <br>this<br><br>just wait for the battery on his neck to run out</br></br></br>  Turn the oxygen in his lungs into cyanide.  <br>No<br>Because dio is love</br></br>  <br>build a vessel around him. This can be done any number of ways.<br>Uiharu touches the vessel and activates Thermal Hand.<br>The EXACT temperature of the entire contents of the vessel will be preserved. This is all heat vibration, and thus, all vectors within the system, locked into their current status.<br>Quantum freezing occurs, unable to move or change without raising or lowering the temperature, his necessary biological functions cease, while preserved at temperature.<br><br>And that's how Uiharu fanwank kills a self-described god.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not really how it works, though.</br>  <br>Since only stands can touch stands I'm gonna guess no. Plus ZAWARUDO!</br>  <br>None of their fucking powers is how it really works.</br>  <br>Madara ain't got enough shit to beat Accelerator at his peak.<br><br>And I'm not talking about pre brain damaged Accelerator. I'm not talking about post brain damaged Accelerator nor awakened Black Wing Accelerator. Hell, I'm not even talking about World War III White Wings Accelerator either. I'm talking about Kami Nimo Hitoshii Chikara No Henrin Wo Furuu Mono Angelerator with full control over his awakened state (which alone has helped him tanked an Eurasia Buster attack without using vector reflection, flying casually at Mach 15 movement speed), with supersonic reaction speed, high level intellect support by near ten thousands of espers that rival 2 super computer which can predict weather for a whole month ahead with perfect accuracy, along with high skilled markmanship, a modified crutch that hide counter measure to protect his choker from interference devices. With just his esper ability alone, Accelerator has showed to be able to survive no less than 200 millions of meteors from Divine Judgement, reflecting human magic, absorbing 5 minute worth of Earth's kinetic energy, fighting while protecting normal citizens at supersonic speed, wrecking Dark Matter without even the need to unleash his Wings, reverse-engineering magic technique, accessing and editing informations stored in human brain, and last but not least, monitoring fetal development just by touching a pregnant woman.</br></br></br>  <br>10/10. Would read it again.</br>  Sure. Get Lancer from Fate/Stay Night and have him use his spear. The only thing that can stop it is divine intervention.   a fucking attosecond   Apparently we just pull our punches at the last second.<br><br>gg no re</br></br>  <br>This. Gae Bolg &gt; Accelertwink</br>  <br><br> implying Accelerator doesn't have Saber-tier's plot armor. </br></br>  Have Kuroko teleport poison directly inside his heart while he sleeps.<br><br>Or just literally . 60-80 more years left, tops. He's only human.</br></br>  we have quite the assortment of autistic methods in this thread but why don't we just poison him.<br>With a gas in his sleep or something worse in his food</br>  <br> How do we kill the Accelerator? <br><br>With fire.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't, though. He just has an OP ability.</br>  <br>The fate series would be so much better without her. No endless clones, no asspulls.</br>  <br>You can't. <br><br>No matter what counter-measures you have on him he can just sprout white wings bullshit and survive it. Even Touma only won the fight in the snow because Accel let him to</br></br></br>  I love it when this guy starts laughing.<br>Like holy fuck.<br>Just make him listen to recordings of that shit, he might just die of embarrassment.</br></br>  <br>loli overload</br>  <br>No, Touma won because he the strongest plot armor ever.</br>  I feel sorry for Accelerator. The guy is just a big bundle of unfortunate circumstances. He would have been just a normal, well-adjusted guy if he had a better upbringing.  He beat Accelerator once.<br>He can do it again.</br>  Kazuma could kill Accelerator or even slice of his bs wings. <br><br>Prove me wrong faggots.</br></br>  Easy  <br>10/10 would read again</br>  <br>Tell Izzard some acceptable lie about what Accelerator's power is, so he'll be confident, and then have him imagine Accelerator ceasing to exist.</br>  Lure him in with the fake Loli.    <br> monitoring fetal development just by touching a pregnant woman. <br>wut?</br></br>  <br>Could Nanami get vectors?</br>  Alucard and his immense plot armor of omnipresence  <br>If anyone ever tried to pull that in real life, everyone in the room would be beating the shit out of them before they were halfway through the laugh.</br>  poison  <br>It'd be a doozy, but with his plot armor, he could probably live.</br>  <br>Well she probably couldn't see them, and the powers are all over the damn place it's impossible understand what it actually is in the first place.<br><br>Then again she's Nanami, so she'll find some way to troll him.</br></br></br>  Send him to South Korea.  <br>This. He's fucked against Ars Magna.</br>  <br>You punch and then just before it connects you pull it back quickly.</br>  <br> Still couldn't kill Touma with it <br>His power is shit.</br></br>  <br>The guy shot Touma with fake bullets, chopped off his arm, and then shat himself like a retard and got so scared he couldn't use his magic anymore. It was as plot-dictated as Touma beating Accelerator.</br>  <br>Acelerator can only control vectors, so kill him with something that's not vectorial. Like temperature?<br><br>You could also poison him. His supercomputer like brain theorically has the power to detect fumes, but his sensing organs can't. By the time he finds out it's too late.</br></br></br>  Uchiha Madara  <br>Make him read the series<br> "I'm sure you'll enjoy this," says Mikasa as Mikasa hands you a book titled, "From the best-selling authors of Accelerator's angst, we give you Electric Boogaloo 2: Accelerator's never ending angst BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU NEVER WANT IT TO END." <br> I always manage to save everyone <br> Unless it's a well developed side character with a lot of plot potential :^) <br> Kakine is literally taken over by a Rhinoceros Beetle <br> Rhinoceros Beetle is also the best boy in the series <br> Rensa <br> Rensa <br> RENSA "ALL YOUR POWERS COMBINED AND I'M OUT OF WRITING IDEAS" CYBORG <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Vq<wbr>CXXMvMm6g</wbr>  [ ] <br> immortal zombies eating brains <br> actual zombies <br> Original Kakine gets back his body <br> promptly turned into a beachball and then a girl and becomes Othinus' bitch <br> REALITY <br> W <br> A <br> R <br> P <br> Omnipotent magical god <br> lose to a bullied human via the power of bad writing <br> I really wanted a Death Note but I have to make do with this email requesting the prompt annihilation of Touma <br> I descended from the heavens <br> to punch Touma out using my fist <br> Everyone's out to kill Touma including Obama: the comedy fanfic. <br> <br>And I'm only up to NT 10 so far.</br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask Shiki.</br>  <br>I'm not sure there is a "too late" for him, since he could theoretically just restructure his whole body to its previous state.</br>  <br>That sounds so good, I might read the novels.</br>  <br>Some plot points are So Bad it's Good.</br>  Especially Mr Rhinoceros Beetle 05 who was surprisingly well characterised for a character who was seemingly written while the author was under the heavy influence of drugs.  <br> He doesn't, <br> survives penetrating gunshot to the center of the head. </br></br>  <br>There where often enough people surviving headshots and other shit penetrating the brain</br>  <br>What do we think the bullet took out? Basal ganglia (action selection), Broca's area and Wernicke's area?</br>  <br> Like temperature? <br>To increase the temperature you would need to add or take away heat into the system around him, meaning energy will be flowing, meaning there will be a flux, meaning there's a vector.</br></br>  <br>with trips</br>  <br>Vacuum</br>  Magic Vectors &gt; Science Vectors  <br>Accel can use those too, as well as make up vectors that don't exist, when in angel mode.</br>  Reality warp, any skill that cannot be blocked like Gay Bulge, Za Warudo, just take out the oxygen of everything around him, etc etc etc.<br><br><br>Not if you can manipulate temperature of something in a closed space, like lvl 5 Uiharu does. Just melt his brain.</br></br></br>  <br> Gay Bulge <br>Won't kill him.</br></br>  <br> like lvl 5 Uiharu does <br>No one fucking knows what a level 5 Uiharu could do, stop making shit up.</br></br>  <br>Uiharu can't even reach level 5 or else she wouldn't have gotten fucked over by the Parameter List so speculating about that is irrelevant and useless.</br>  <br>When heat increases the average kinetic energy of the moving molecules increases. These individual molecules should have vectors.</br>  <br> Won't kill him. <br>Yes it will.<br>The only thing stopping Lancer from killing everything that stands in his way is his Luck stat.<br>And don't give me that 'vector of causality' bullshit again, it's easy to tell when you're talking out your ass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I challenge him to a fist fight.</br>  <br> implying he can't vector causality with white wings </br>  <br>Explain to me how piercing his heart will kill Accel, when he can move blood around his body without it.</br>  <br>It doesn't just pierce the heart.<br>Gáe Bolg: Barbed Spear that Pierces with Death (刺し穿つ死棘の槍ゲイ・ボルク, also translated as Spear of Impaling Barbed Death?) is an attack focused on a single target, created by Lancer to suit his own style, that strikes a fatal blow that always pierces the opponent's heart and ruins their body from within with its thousand iron thorns. It literally freezes the mana in the air, and it can easily be perceived as a sure-kill technique by all those around simply from being charged with magical energy.<br><br>I don't know about you, but I'd think particularly difficult equations would be hard to focus on when you have a thousand iron thorns running through my body.<br><br><br>Then it becomes bullshit again. Like how Accel doesn't have Esper power (nobody in Indexverse does) to do reality warping on the scale of Mahoukaverse. Its literally challenging the laws of the world, as a single person. You don't beat the world.<br>I'll explain it how I explained Haruhi killing Accel a few threads ago, when somebody tried to explain that Accel could reverse the causality of Haruhi's wish.<br>Haruhi Wishes Accelerator is gone &gt; This Wish changes reality &gt; Reality says Accelerator is gone &gt; Accelerator says Accelerator is not gone &gt; Reality takes precedence &gt; Accelerator disappears.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Curses, jamming his transmitter and ozone. If you fail to kill him quickly, he will go angel mode and you won't be able to stop him anymore. Anyways, we have enough evidence to suggest level 5s can't be killed in the first place. Their souls will just use their abilities to facilitate new vessels for themselves. Accel can reassemble his corpse, Kakine can create a new body with Dark Matter, Mikoto can just jump into the net and eventually create a mecha version of herself, Mugino becomes living lasers, Misaki becomes a collective schizophrenic consciousness inside everyone she's ever used her powers on. Number 6 and number 7 probably can't die. The former being an abstract legend and the latter having too much guts.</br>  <br> Ozone <br>I think he could just filter that out using reflection<br><br>In my opinion there's several surefire ways of killing him:<br> Ingested poison: Something that paralyses his limbs preventing him from switching on his esper powers or kills him eg cardiac arrest before he can do so or killing him silently before he can figure out what's wrong and activate his esper powers (something like carbon monoxide which) <br> Speed/priority attacks: killing him quickly and before he can switch on his esper powers. Eg discreet sniping or decapitation <br> Hacking/removing his choker: Defcon apparently discussed the viability of introducing malicious code into electronic devices VIA CHARGERS. Swap out Accel's charger or charge cycle his battery too often and that will interfere with his combat ability <br> Very slowly: ROS via oxygen molecules and/or accumulated DNA damage will eventually give Accel cancer since he needs oxygen to live but his body's metabolism will produce ROS causing cell damage. Biological weapons might also work here especially if a virus imitating Accel's DNA was rejected by his barrier and his barrier <br> Affecting Accel's mood balance: probably falls under 'drugs' but changing his hormone balance esp oxytocin and/or binding may affect how susceptible he is to depression <br>**on that note, Microsoft Word looks like it has a better comparing facility than Accelerator, seriously how difficult is it to compare two copies of the same document when it's small enough to fit on physical media<br><br>I reckon that Misaka Original could one shot brain damaged Accelerator given the fact that the choker presumably contains electronic components if she gets the attack in before he flips the switch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God goku shits a ki blast, godly ki can't be read or understood by his autoreflect and bypasses his defenses.  <br>Auto-reflect is on at all times even after the brain damage.</br>  <br>I assumed that was just UV?</br>  <br>Otherwise I'd have thought that the brain damage barely affected him at all. Autoreflect, in my opinion, is Accel's most useful ability period.</br>  <br>Send some faggot with a lot of plot armor</br>  <br> kaworu <br> is that you? </br></br>  <br>With Tohno Shiki, Kamijou Touma, or a Servant.<br>Alternatively, Demonbane, Alucard, or Card Captor Sakura.<br>Lastly, Uchiha Madara, Dio, Freakazoid, or Kefka.</br></br></br>  <br>Decelerator</br>  <br>rotareleccA</br>  <br>is shooting him in the head an option?</br>  <br>Yeah if you want painless, fast suicide.</br>  <br>So anybody is reading his manga? has he fucked the blond girl yet?</br>  <br>He's pure for LO.</br>  <br>15 times.</br>   morons still think that Accelerator is invincible <br>Silver Surfer can easily kill Accelerator. Everything I said are facts.</br>    <br>I thought WORST was pregnant by him.</br>  <br>Ask him politely to drink a gallon of bleach.</br>  <br> Comfy SoL with Accel and LO <br> LO enters Accel's apartment <br> "I got you a glass of really tasty milk!" <br> "Rub a dub dub, thanks for the itadakimasu!" <br> ... <br> "This shit is top shelf! Get me some more!" <br> "Right away!" <br><br>I've thought of a lot of ways to kill accel, but this is by far the stupidest and funniest. If there were a way for him to go, I'd want this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hire a doctor to heal him.</br></br>  <br>Academy City sure is the best place to hide Gallifrey's most forgetful Time Lord psychic criminal who keeps misplacing dangerous books.</br>  <br><br>Ever think about how the cleaning robots look like Daleks?<br><br>They don't look like Daleks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to worry, I'm sure that Academy City is fast on their way to producing Cybermen. <br>Also wonder what'd it be like if Accelerator was hooked up to the TARDIS considering the fact that it's made out of maths. And the circuits could probably compensate for his lost language abilities.</br></br>  <br>You can't kill the killer cripple. He has achieved maximum power in shounin lore while now baring a major weakness, which is time limited ass whoopings with huge cool down periods.</br>  <br><br>Uiharu is a worthless piece of shit.<br>She can't reach level 5.<br><br>What do you think the Parameter List is?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cybermen? Cybermen?<br><br>You are superior in only one respect. You are better at dying.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Accelerator happens upon a group of half converted clone babies <br>How mad would he be?<br>All the Five_Over and cyborg stuff could be heading in that direction with the Level 5s becoming obsolete.</br></br></br>  <br>But don't let the cleaning robots get into a fight with the cyborgs, anon.  Or Aleister will be mad. </br>  <br>This. He can basically manipulate temperature by considering it as a collection of vectors.</br>  When will the NT13 prologue be released? I thought it will be this day.    With all the crazy shit happening in Raildex it almost feels like a japanese version of those early DC or Marvel comics. Face it, Raildex is a japanese High school Justice league  <br> everything that has superpowers is a Marvel or DC rip-off </br>  <br>Have you been listening to the Daleks mixtape again?<br><br>Dude you could roast your ears doing that, stop.</br></br></br>  <br>gae bolg gg</br>  <br>with The Power of Love<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZMx<wbr>vH5RsQKg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Its in the volume where he meets Aiwass.</br>  <br>And he calcs the weight and stuff of the baby. <br>Ayyy lmao.</br></br>  <br>Nanika kill the edgiest faggot alive<br>done</br></br>  <br>Accel'd definitely kill Daleks and Cybermen though and the kekworthy Master. <br><br>He'd probably have trouble only with the most OP characters like the Celestial Toymaker, Sutekh, time messing/reality warping and the haxworthy conceptual beings like Word Lords and maybe the Shift.</br></br></br>  They fucked at least once, right?  <br>Nah.</br>  Van probably didn't even know that girls have vaginas.  <br>The opening is the first thing I think about when I remember this series.</br>  ITT: People who did nothing wrong   who homu here   <br>She is evil and corrupted Kirino's natural upbringing, thereby causing a result which is not even in line with her own goals. She did everything wrong.</br>    <br><br> degenerate subconsciously wants to fuck her brother <br> It's the fault of an innocent girl who gave slightly wrong advice as a younger child due to concern for her friend <br><br>Fuck off, Kirino a degenerate shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, her meddling while wrong was a necessary one to give Kyousuke and Kirino true happiness. You may hate her but this story wouldn't of happened the way it did without her.

You're worse than Fate fags  <br><br>There's nothing in the main work itself to suggest they get back together, the authorial intent is irrelevant. In the anime I watched they break up and there's nothing to suggest otherwise.</br></br>    <br>Quality post brother.</br>   browse thread <br> fags and their shit tier anime skanks <br> no homu did nothing wrong <br>I'm ashamed /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Even in the anime, it's extremely obvious that they still love each other, and there is also nothing to suggest that they DIDN'T get back together later, maybe when Kirino graduated high school</br>  <br>0/10<br>Also <br> main work  <br> in the anime </br></br></br></br>  <br>The afterstory does suggest they get back together.</br>  <br>  the main work itself <br><br>The LN has plenty of evidence supporting that they're lovers for life.</br></br></br>        <br> This is what the manamifag thinks <br>  It can not read the LN <br> It does not know about the after story. </br></br></br>    What would have happened if Kyosuke hadn't been there for her?  <br>Nao was a hero in YnS, well at least the VN. She helped Haru stop being a wishy washy faggot and man up to loving his sister.</br>  <br>Kyousuke already wasn't there for her when she wanted him to be, the only difference is she wouldn't get his dick in the end</br>  <br>I meant at the start of the series, and all throughout. What would have happened if Kyousuke hadn't take the hit for the eroge? If he handn't brought her back to Japan? If he hadn't been able to bring himself to tell her how he felt?</br>  <br>Dat doujin</br>  <br>I can't get over how damn romantic it was having Kyousuke fly to america and telling her he can't live without her.</br>  <br><br><br>any links for arts like this<br>.t a Kirino fan</br></br></br></br>  <br>As much as I love Manami, despite how shit she is, she is arguably the reason why Kirino ended up keeping her feelings towards her brother. If she hadn't said those things to both siblings, they would've stayed close enough for Kirino to mature and let go of those feelings for Kyousuke.<br><br>Whether Manami is suddenly evil hellspawn for what she did is debatable. At the very least, I can respect her for doing what she thought she needed to do to have her happiness. Was it fucked up? Yeah, but I think that's what ever so slightly makes her character more "real" if you will. People do fucked up shit all the time and it usually backfires gloriously. In Manami's case, it made Kirino a brocon</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/73xo4cvw<wbr>acyzvl0/ZALE70yQTH</wbr></br>  <br>thanks you very much</br>  <br>That was the cutest shit. Definitely one of the best points in the series</br>  Does /a/ like Monster?  nah its shit  <br>B-but it's on MAL's top 50...</br>  no    <br><br>Do you like monster?</br></br>  I like Monster.<br><br>There are very few anime/manga that are actually worth people's time and Monster is one of them.</br></br>  <br>I love monster. All hail Johan!</br>  <br><br>Eva was best girl, all she wanted was love.</br></br>  <br>I've only watched the first episode and it seems like the kind of story that I like, I just wanted to know whether it's going to turn into a trainwreck like most of the animes that I've watched.</br>  <br>It doesn't turn into a trainwreck at all. It remains engrossing for the entire 74 episodes, and the ending is perfect.</br>  <br>it's literally the definition of trainwreck</br>  <br><br>Well its not a generic anime with some high school doctor/detective/samurai/demon/ghos<wbr>t/penguin. Trying to fight a villain who's way stronger then him but as the underdog musters the power!.<br><br>Or about giant robots,idols, zombies, magic swords.<br><br>So if your tired of the same bullshit I think you might like it</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  I liked that epsiode where nothing interesting happened and it was boring as shit<br><br>Wait thats entire show</br></br>  <br> B-but it's on MAL's top 50... <br>Then why don't you ask MAL?</br></br>  <br>If the anime's pacing is too slow you should change to the manga but it's a very faithful adaption<br> I like it.<br>Still one of my favourite manga</br> </br></br>  There aren't any meme waifus in it so it's objectively garbage. Also, who the fuck thought an anime should have decent writing, an engrossing story, and characters that aren't color-coded oppai lolis? It boggles the mind how anyone could enjoy it.  Spoiler week continues here<br><br>Eren's height is actually canon Edition</br></br>  <br>Worst shingekis.</br>  <br>eremikadefensesquad please go back to tumblr.</br>   still no leaks   <br>I like how this picture has their heights in it too.<br><br>Like as if it's saying "hey look Eren is 7cm bigger than her! so it's definitely ok for the two to be a couple!! nothing wrong with being a subhuman (sub 6ft) manlet!!!"</br></br></br>  <br>ackersexual pls.</br>  <br> HELM mentioned <br> EMfag gets butthurt <br>Why are you so insecure?</br></br></br>  <br>He's not taking it so well after canon EH blushing &amp; handholding and canon LM kissing and cover all in the same month.</br>  <br>EM BTFO for the millionth time.</br>  <br>Just wait for the movie. The trailer looked more like EM.</br>  <br>Coolman229 please.</br>  <br> EM  <br> not BTFO </br></br>  <br>I'm not interested in the movie because none of the characters I like are in it.</br>  <br>fuku-shuu pls.</br>  <br>I guess we should let him have fun and post his shitty fanarts. It's all he has left. <br><br><br>Watch the trailer in HD and pause it. It's definitely not Eren. Plus the actress that played Mikasa said she doesn't see EM as romantic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same. Although I got a little interested after Isayama was mentioned. I might watch it to have good laugh though.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about the kiss, but the trailer in general. The kiss looks kind of forced and Eren will probably go full rageturd on him or some bullshit like that.</br>  <br> EM were screaming each other's names and Eren was jealous after Shikishima kissed Micucksa.</br>  <br>Maybe the story will be better than the actual manga</br>  <br>Is it karma for chapter 70 now that Eren is the cuck?</br>  <br>Well at least shippers get the romance fantasy they've always wanted.</br>  <br>The guns already make me sceptical.</br>  <br>Eren's too busy holding hands with Armin or Historia to care what Mikasa does.</br>  <br>But it doesn't Mikasa, who is stronk, didn't push him off and even closed her eyes.</br>  <br>Why would he? It's not like Shikishima was raping his sister.</br>  <br>She doesn't have her strength in the movie.</br>  <br>Maybe Eren will push him away. We already saw a pic of Eren arguing with OC guy. She also makes a strange face before it happens.</br>  <br>I was talking about movie Eren getting buttmad. Historia's not even in the movie because no aryans.</br>   an OOC 3DPD movie had to be made to give EMfags what they want <br>How sad.</br>  <br>[citation needed]<br>Eren is still a titan, and she's still the first of her class.</br></br>  i hope my fellow ymirbrothers will follow me in mass suicide if Isayama actually dares to continue going this het road with EH  <br><br>Why are so many people saying Eren was jealous by the kiss? What part of the trailer showed that?</br></br>  <br>He was seen arguing with Donut Steel later. But it could be a different scene entirely.</br>  <br>Mind posting pic? And that's Kiko overall face, really.</br>  <br>If she was in the movie he would tell her how amazing she was while Mikasa is getting kissed by some shitlet OC.</br>  <br>The EMfags and LMfags got everything they wanted in the movie.</br>  <br>But she is. Her name in it is Hayana or something like that.</br>  <br>Too bad she's not and now Eren is stuck in kebab cuckland.</br>  <br>Yes, a shitty adaption. Feels good being an EHfag.</br>  <br>The scene where he goes in to punch the OC guy. You can see the background is the same scene.</br>  <br> google hayana shingeki movie <br> get indian porn star in results </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>   Series with actual plot <br> everyone is talking about shipping instead </br>  <br> My nigga </br>  <br>You can't really see the background of the kiss scene, and they are with the clothes all the movie, probably.</br>  <br>I'd say wait until the actual chapter comes out but there'd probably be shitposting anyway.</br>  <br>Who cares? It's an OOC adaption anyway. Don't waste time in analysing something insignificant.</br>  <br>I doubt Eren would punch someone above him in rank for kissing Mikasa.</br>  <br>Still related to the series and allowed.</br>  <br>Here.</br>  <br>It's Hiana.</br>  <br>Maybe movie Eren is different. He's a shitty plot device in the manga after all, he could actually have character in live action.</br>  Whats EM and LM?  <br>Glowing titty.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Eren x Marco and Levi x Marco</br></br>  <br>Cute.</br>  Are you guys ready for some troubles?  <br>I thought that was movie Annie since she's apparently canon with movie Bert.</br>  <br>The ships eremikadefensesquad and ackersexual fight each other for.</br>  <br>Lili or whatever is annie.</br>  <br><br> canon with bert <br> not with armin <br><br>What is this shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it true that his name is  Remus? </br>  <br>That's Lili.</br>  <br>Annie is Lil. Bertholdt isn't in the movie.</br>  <br>How is punching someone for a kiss considered having character? If they were going to change him that much they were better off changing his name and calling him an OC too. The whole reason why certain characters had their names changed was to avoid pissed off fans so why would they have a main character named Eren in love with Mikasa? You can't be that OOC and still share a name with a canon character.</br>  <br>I really hope we actually get his name next chapter.</br>  <br>Then who is Colossal</br>  <br>More than ever.</br>  <br>Armin.</br>  <br><br>No idea, haven't heard it yet.<br><br><br><br> inb4 his last name is Jaeger </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he's also a rageturd in the manga.</br>  <br>His name is Chaz.</br>  <br>Not Bert is Fukushi.</br>    <br> You can't be that OOC and still share a name with a canon character <br>Says who? Mikasa looks pretty OOC too.</br></br>  <br>Why is Annie kissing Krista?</br>  <br>He still wouldn't be obsessively jealous of Mikasa and punch a guy for kissing her, even in the manga. His brain just isn't programmed to care about shit like that.</br>  While we're on the topic of troubles, who had it worse?<br><br>Nick or Mike? <br><br> I vote Nick because he was a god-fearing man who didn't afraid of anything </br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't watch the movie to know. She even do the cruel world speech and all.</br>  <br>Because short blonde girls have to stick together</br>  <br>Maybe that's the only OOC part about him.</br>  <br><br>That's not Krista its Reiner.</br></br>  Will we get something like this again this month, brothers?  <br>Damn, Nips are really really ugly people compared to their anime characters.<br><br>I guess you were right when you said that anime is based on white people.</br></br></br>  <br>Just that he didn't punch Levi, they were just talking.</br>  <br>Maybe he would. Who's to say he wouldn't react that way.</br>  <br>Nips are on average very ugly.</br>  <br>We didn't see the whole scene. Just a pic of him arguing with OC guy.</br>  <br>Does Ackerman talk count?</br>  <br>If they didn't care about characters looking OOC they would've put manlet in there and actually used his name. So far movie Mikasa has said the same lines she said in the manga so I don't see how she's OOC.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Again, pic pls?</br>  <br>So much our dreams of going there and becoming English teachers and live the dream of eating ramen and sushi and bento and buying Shingeki no Kyojin merchandise all day long.</br>  <br>Shonkishima grabbed his fist.</br>  <br>Bert getting NTRed is a miracle of the universe.</br>  <br>I was thinking more about the lines of eh moments. But EMfags getting BTFO would be nice too.</br>  Which characters other than Levi weren't in the film?  <br>I fear Isayama is going to toss EH's relationship away.</br>  <br>Do you even read the manga? Eren didn't get the whole Marlo/Hitch thing and he didn't even realize Jean was in love with Mikasa even after he practically said it to him. Eren doesn't care about romance and wouldn't care about someone kissing Mikasa. He'd probably just tell them to hurry up so they can get on with the mission.</br>  <br>Probably, since a new arc is starting.</br>  <br>That's not gonna happen. Though they might not interact this chapter.</br>  <br>BRAY, Erwin, Connie, and Marco.</br>  <br><br>Truly the purest form of justice.</br></br>  <br>*BRAYH</br>  <br>Who the fuck were in the titans then?</br>  <br>Everyone, except EMA.</br>  <br>Will Historia give Eren a good luck kissu?</br>  <br>i'm just wondering how this asshole beat the armored titan</br>  <br> the kids look like chimpanzees <br><br>Hetfag fanart always delivering the worst quality possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? Historia is obviously going in the next scouting, so I don't see they being separated soon. She's still part of the top 10.</br>  <br>EH child looks like it has downs.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't even care about the Hetfaggotry, just liked the crazy AA kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Connie is in it though. So is Annie.</br>  <br>She is the queen. She cannot do this anymore, she has to wait in the orphanage for Ymir, her true love.</br>  <br>Mr. Hanji was in it.</br>  <br>Maybe the OCs?</br>  <br>After the reader learned about their connection it would make sense if they had a scene together. There's not much to discuss though. He could tell her he's an Ackerman too. Knowing how Isayama handles awkward moments it has the potential to be pretty funny.</br>  <br>Ymir is kill and Historia isn't a lesbian anyway.</br>  <br>Eren's more focused on Titans than on women. That's why Annie is the perfect girl for him.</br>  <br>I and the EMfags will probably die if that happens. Me from hapiness.</br>  <br>That's not an OC, that's the guy based on a Japanese general responsible for the genocide of Korean people. They changed his appearance / name so the movie sells better in Korea.</br>  <br>No, they're changed with Lil and Souda(?)<br>Like how Levi is changed with Shikishima and all</br></br>  <br>Annie likes Armin.</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  <br>She has to take care of people inside the walls. They'll probably barely interact from now on, since the political arc just ended.</br>  <br>Oh, so he's Pixis? I thought he was Erwin.</br>  <br>Me too, from keking.</br>  <br>That means they aren't in it.</br>  <br>They can share each other. I'm sure none of them would object.</br>  <br>It's ok, they don't have to interact anymore. We'll get the surprise 9 months later.</br>  <br>She will carry their child and wait for Eren's return.</br>  <br>Yeah. I was saying they aren't in it.</br>  Dumping best couple.  <br><br>nice</br></br>    <br>Most of the people who lost their homes might go too, since Wall Maria's fixing is certainly by their point of view. And Historia wouldn't stay on the background doing nothing, she proved it with the chicken titan.</br>  <br> Mina/Annie <br> not Hitch/Annie </br></br>    Annie is a slut.  <br>Chicken titan was a personal thing.</br>  Arminfags are the worst shitposters, I wish they would just die.    <br><br>EH confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Anyone have that comic where Hitch challenges Historia to a contest for Annie's attention?</br>  <br><br> worse than Ymirshits and Hisfags <br><br>You're kidding right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't lump me in with Ymirfags and Arminfags.</br>  <br><br>Wow thanks. I didn't expect anything from this, but this Japanese perception of what Germans are like actually gave me cancer!</br></br>  <br>That was in Chuugakkou right?</br>  <br>You are still cancerous.</br>  <br>Historiafags did nothing wrong.</br>  <br><br>thanks</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br> the main shitposters in every single thread since chapter 60 did nothing wrong </br></br>  <br>Just having fun like everyone else.</br>  <br> main shitposters in every single thread <br>That's Ymirfags, dumbass</br></br>  <br>There's no such thing as a non-shitposter in these threads.</br>  <br><br>Ymirfags, Hisfags. What's the difference?</br></br>  <br>Yes, they did.</br>  <br><br>Says the Hisfag.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>That would be the netherfag, and that since way before ch 60.</br>  <br>http://imgur.com/a/gZSnO</br>  <br>What exactly did Historiafags do that makes you so butthurt? Act the same as any other characterfag here?</br>  <br><br> netherfag <br><br>You mean allahfag?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but thank you.</br>  <br><br> Yes <br><br> There also more annoying than Ymirfags, at least they give up after posting some shitty tumblr art </br></br></br></br>  <br>What.</br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Marry me.</br>  <br> There will never be anything this good in the actual series </br>  <br> Annie's nose </br>  <br>Why is Chuugakkou Bert such a miracle?</br>  <br><br> Y-yes <br><br> Also holy shit I forgot what happened to Slutty? </br></br></br></br>  <br>You should just stay in /u/ then.</br>  <br> caring about Wesley </br>  <br><br>I don't b-but did he died or something?</br></br>  <br>Wesley is probably still shitposting here, just without the avatarfagging and soc shit.</br>  <br>He and his twin Dick are back to /co/ now.   Saw one of his drawings in a gravity falls thread once </br>  <br>Someone posted a new pic of him recently.</br>  <br>And yet you call others shitposters.</br>  <br><br>pls no bully</br></br>  <br><br>RIP slutfag literally no one will miss you.</br></br>  <br>What if I bully you  sexually </br>  Levi a shit.  <br><br> That's lewd and inappropriate <br><br> so don't stop </br></br></br></br>  <br>What if he's the Ymirfag/Islamshit everyone's been complaining about?</br>  Apparently the OST tracklist of the live action is this:<br><br>01.

I assume MT and first king had one common ancestor, then MT decided to go his own way and Grisha and Ymir are the result of the family line that decided to branch out.

Looks like he's going to be some smug asshole.</br>  <br>So like Levi. Just that he doen't smile, like Levi.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>So tell how do you think he isn't like Levi. Because Levis's an asshole. You can see it by the way he talked to Annie and how he treated Nick and Historia.<br> cravat <br> humanity's strongest <br> name who relates to Mikasa </br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't acting smug at all. He's just a manlet placeholder with changed personality.</br>  <br>Weren't there character descriptions of the movie cast or something and the only thing Shikishima has in common with Levi is that he's the world's strongest and fujos got mad because he's not cool and aloof anymore?</br>  <br>Haven't seen these.</br>  リリ    At what time dreamfag delivered last month?  <br><br>That is absolutely fucking disgusting.</br></br>   ID:HBWv1IEB <br>Dreamfag's ID on 2ch.</br>  <br>Prolly late, it's 2nd only, we have to wait 2-3 more days anon.</br>  Anyone else HYPE?  <br>You do know that IDs change all the time, right?</br>  <br>I know, browse boards with ID. But sometimes old IDs come back, and this happens often.</br>  <br>6th in nipland</br>  <br>Depends on if he has static or dynamic IP. It's nice to keep the ID in mind, but it doesn't mean that if someone claims to be Dreamfag it's not him.</br>  anons say that Mikasa's kiss scene looked forced.<br>But if the person was Eren instead of the OC character will you still say the kiss scene was forced, or completely ignore the comment you stated.</br>  http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8879656.html<br>Looks like Isayama enjoyed Mad Max</br></wbr>  <br>The kiss was not forced, Mikasa didn't react negatively from it.</br>  <br>Why people overreact about this movie? I found it meh.</br>  <br>I was replying this to the anons that through the kiss scene was forced.</br>  <br>That's because you have mediocre tastes.</br>  <br><br>Mikasa has a frown on her face and you can see that it's Shikishima that pulled her towards him. If that was supposed to be Eren I'd also think that she didn't want the kiss. or that she at least had no intention of kissing whoever's kissing her.</br></br>  <br>Did you seriously claim the live action movie is decent? Did you seriously claim that any live action movie is decent?</br>  <br>It's mad max.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're the one who does if you think this shit movie where everyone is a Nip and replaced is any good.</br>  <br>Do people here really care that much about this</br>  <br>Nevermind then, I suck cocks.</br>  <br>We're talking about Mad Max faggot.</br>  <br>Yeah I misread. Mad max was okay figures Isayama would like it.</br>  <br>What is Old Boy? What is Snowpiercer?</br>  <br>That is Kiko overall face though. And Shikishima don't pull her, her head stay in the same place, he just put his hand behind her head.</br>  <br>Pay closer attention, he not only places his hand on her nape in order to pull her towards him but he also forcefully drew his lips towards hers. You can simply tell that Mikasa was taken by surprise.</br>  <br>You guys sure go autistic for a scene that lasted less than a second.</br>  <br>I don't even care about EM or LM, it's just that LMfags take this scene as confirmation when that's not even the manlet in the first place.</br>  <br> lips open <br> eyes closed <br> doesn't show surprise. </br></br></br>  <br>LM is fucking retarded. It is the definition of forced pairing just because they stand in the same panel together and on top of that they have zero chemistry aside from fighting together as clones. I don't even like Mikasa or the other two involved but EM makes more sense.</br>  <br>No one here is saying anything about comfirmation, only a few fags who says the kiss was forced and fingerpoint.</br>  <br> tumblr <br>Of course, LMfags are tumblrwhales.</br></br>  <br>So why so much insecurity that you feel the need to keep saying it was forced, when it makes much more sense and he's not Levi?<br><br><br>Nice comeback retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the one calling it forced. I'm just saying I think LM is retarded but I expect such retardation from people who like Manlet or any of his pairings.</br>  <br>What is with the fujo obsession with anorexic manlet?</br>  I feel really bad for the EMfags. They're not taking this new direction gracefully.  <br>I'm loving all this obnoxiousness from someone who browses tumblr.</br>  <br>Why use the japanese title?</br>  <br> all these LM fanarts of Levi just as tall or taller than Mikasa <br>Kek, is manlet standing on a stool?</br></br>  <br> I don't know what to say, so here's some ad hominem <br>Have you ever been on google images?</br></br>  <br>EH?</br>  <br>That's his titan form after injecting himself with the serum.</br>  <br>I wonder what the fujos see on Levi, and I mean it. Do they really picture him like a tall, slender dude?</br>  Did they reach that cabin yet?  <br>Thanks for fixing the picture anon but he's way shorter than that<br><br>The top of his head should reach her nose at most</br></br></br>  <br>Mikasa is kneeling.</br>  Why do LMfags pretend Shikishima is manlet when it has been made clear he's an OC character whose only common point with Levi is that he's humanity's strongest. If they wanted to have manlet in the movie, they would have, just like they kept EMA and Hanji. I understand you want to validate your ship but Shikishima kissing Mikasa in that movie does'nt equate manlet doing it.  <br>Why are you so defensive? <br> If they wanted to have manlet in the movie, they would have <br>No, they wouldn't have. Can you imagine the shitfest had they named him Levi and kept the kiss scene?</br></br></br>  <br> Shikishichi kissing Mikasa in that movie doesn't equate manlet doing it <br>Not a LMfag, but who cares? They all look the same.</br></br>  Can we all agree that Levi is one of the worst characters?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You know is bait, anon. The movie is going to be shit but people still are going to watch it because minor irrelevant romantic conflict.</br>  <br> that manlet face <br>Absolutely perfect.</br></br>   reading wiki stats <br> bimbong is 4'9" &amp; 92lbs <br> mfw </br></br>  <br> Comparing the best, most intelligent and most Alpha male poster in this thread with a pathetic Ymirfag who wants to become a woman. <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Ymir is also Monkey Titan (she dresses like a guy to confuse BR) and she is also Dr. Kishimoto who created the titans.</br>    <br>He isn't good but Annie Ymir and Bert are one tier below making them the worst of the worst.</br>  <br>But Annie is one of the best characters</br>  <br>You must be 18+ to post on 4chan. Get out.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>You're never going to fool the goyim into thinking this is true, Schlomo.</br>  <br> manletino fujos <br>Not surprised.</br></br>  <br>All three are good characters.</br>  <br>Ymir is ok but Bert is terrible.</br>  <br>See .</br>  <br>Nah.</br>  <br>Worst characters are the fujobaits Eren, Levi and Jean.</br>  <br>Tell me, what makes them the worst aside from spouting ebin maymays all the time?</br>  <br> Worst characters are the fujobaits Eren, Levi and Jean. <br><br> Jean <br><br>Ok, this is the end of you kiddo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> says the person with the worst taste imaginable ITT </br>  <br>Yes, thankfully he's mostly a background character.</br>  <br> people sexualize this </br>  <br>One dimensional plot devices with zero depth who only exist to push other (sometimes just slightly) better written characters to advance their development plot.<br><br>Annie is the Evil Jew Witch to Eren.<br>Ymir is the Magic Negro to Historia.<br>Bert is the Jealous Beta Piece of Shit Friend to Reiner (the only good character of the six).<br><br><br>I have the best taste in this thread, whether you like it or not. Your opinion is meaningless trash compared to mine and that is an objective fact, whether you like it or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go back to /soc/, beta loser.</br>  <br>Alright I'll bite. Explain how Bert and Annie only exist to push other characters' development, I can understand with Ymir and Historia but I doubt that's the only reason she exists.</br>  <br>Annie, Bert and Ymir are pieces of shit but that's what makes them good because of their other redeeming qualities. Some balance in a character's personality is great. Like how Annie wanted to teach Eren, Bert grows a spine when Reiner or Annie are in danger and Ymir helps people.<br><br>Though of course you realize that and that you're a mere shitposter, so what's the point in confirming what you already know deep inside.</br></br></br>  <br>But Bimbong is 15.</br>  <br>That's the point.</br>  <br> Ymir and Historia but I doubt that's the only reason she exists. <br>True, she is also a red herring (Ymir-sama), but that makes her character only worse since she still has 0 depth. Hell, even Isayama himself basically confirmed that she is the shallowest character he has in his repertoire.<br><br>  Explain how Bert and Annie only exist to push other characters' development, <br>They have 0 character outside of them pushing the aforementioned respective character ahead in the plot. We know absolutely nothing about the Jew other than the fact she also has a dad (another worthless red herring) and that she is a strong independynt womyn. Her only purpose in the series was to trigger Eren's "development" (if you can call it that).<br><br>Bert is the most pathetic of them all since he is literally absolutely nothing other than the guy who ruined Reiner's living the good life because he was jealous that Reiner was happy and shit. A worthless subhuman who deserves his head to be beaten to a pulp. If he existed in real life, he would be this thread's Ymirfag.<br><br><br>See this piss poor rationalizations? <br> "B-but they also do dem good things!!" <br>It is blatantly obvious that anyone who disagrees on the two most factual facts of the series (1- Jean is the best written &amp; 2- AnYmBert are the worst written characters) have never read a single (well written) book in their lives and they don't even have the slightest idea what defines a well written character.<br><br>To you mongoloids, "a character that I like = good character". This is why you're a subhuman while I am super smart.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Have you worshiped our lord and savior today?  <br>That's on literal midget tier. No woman (of the ones I've met) above the age of 14 is that short unless they're midgets.</br>  <br>My sides. Historia is short enough for a booster seat yet she's in the damn military.</br>  <br>No room to be picky when humanity is going extinct. Do you think women were accepted into the army during the Victorian era? No way in hell.</br>  <br>Yes I did, we're supposed to do it 5 times a day at least. But I don't understand why you posted a picture of Erwin.</br>  <br>You might have brain damage but at least you can write posts with more than 10 words so I'll take you.<br><br> Her only purpose in the series was to trigger Eren's "development" <br>Since it's obvious that you never read a book or another manga in your life, Annie still has open plot threads, even if that means she's going to serve as shifter bait.<br><br> Bert is the most pathetic of them all since he is literally absolutely nothing other than the guy who ruined Reiner's living the good life because he was jealous that Reiner was happy and shit. <br>Did you ever read the manga? Bert even let Reiner stay in his delusions, something that according to you made Reiner happy. He claims he's pathetic and he might be a subhuman but that's what puts him apart from the rest of the main cast and actually it fits well with him being the colossal titan. Better than some cliche evil overlord with a masterplan for sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Legally she is a dwarf,</br>  <br>Now I know this is bullshit bait</br>  <br>Well now their queen is someone who should be sitting in a booster seat, not a big girl throne.</br>  <br> Bert even let Reiner stay in his delusions, something that according to you made Reiner happy. <br>He let him stay happy only until Blurt himself got too unhappy. He is literally a worthless piece of shit who's "if i'm not happy your not happy either!!  BabyRage ". Ryner would probably get a promotion for his acts of heroism in Utgard.<br><br> Since it's obvious that you never read a book or another manga in your life, <br>Ok that just has to be bullshit bait. Why am I even responding to you?<br><br>Notice that you haven't even tried to refute the claims that you don't know what a well written character is, because you know that you don't got the slightest idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dwarfism is a genetic disease and implies disformed limbs compared to a regular human. Historia's limbs have a normal ratio, she's just very small.</br>  <br>Jean is also just the typical jerk with a heart of gold. Nothing really special.</br>  <br>Well she still has time to grow anyway. She's only 15.</br>  <br>Levi objectively got more character depth than the three shits. You can actually almost see some reasoning behind his uprearing and his current character (even though it's still edgy unrealistic anime shit).</br>  <br> soldier Reiner delusions: the post </br>  <br> You can actually almost see some reasoning behind his uprearing and his current character <br>Not really, except you're talking about the fujobait spin offs.</br></br>  <br>How is Ymir any better than the manlet?</br>  <br>Speaking of dwarfism, I bet none of you mongoloids who don't understand that Jean is the best character (etc) have seen Twin Peaks (or if you did, you didn't get it / didn't like it). That's just another of the differences between highly intelligent adults (me) and teenagers who don't read books other than the new "OMGShakespeare!" book series, that's probably really hot with you (google it).</br>  <br>I do everyday</br>   Eren is taller than me <br><br>Should I kill myself?</br></br>  <br>If male, definitely, for Christ's sake.<br><br>If female, depends of how good you look, if below 7/10 then yes.</br></br></br>  <br> always looking for opinion from Erwin or Hanji  <br>That's some real depth there anon</br></br>  <br>I don't worship bland fujobait plebs like Erwin.</br>  Isn't Historia supposed to be modeled after that famous AV actress who's also 4'9"?  <br>Post her pics rite now.</br>  <br>Historia is literally just the design of the MC from his one shot.</br>  <br>I am speechless. I literally am staring at this post with an open mouth.<br><br> a character asking for smartperson's opinion because he's not a smartperson means that the character is dumb <br><br>JUST</br></br></br></br></br>   people replying to that idiot again <br>Really?</br>  <br>Historia looks like your generic wide eyed bmbo.</br>  <br>It's because deep down we realize that "that idiot" is smarter than us and the fact that we can't argue against him properly makes us losers unable to sleep at night.</br>  <br>Anything 170+cm for a girl is giantess-tier</br>  <br>Generic appearance sure but Historia hardly even acts like a bimbo.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> admitting you're that idiot </br>  <br>Indeed, but Islamshit is not capable of rational thinking or good taste so he likes that.</br>  <br> but Historia hardly even acts like a bimbo <br>Yes she does actually.</br></br>  <br>But if she's 8-9-10 she can still live. Some people have a fetish for giantess.</br>  <br><br>Bortfags can't control their borthurt.

Clearly you can just be ass kicking all the time,using the noodle would be beneficial as well something manlet clearly doesn't have</br>  <br>What Jean had barely counts as character development, /snk/ assumes that character development means doing an 180 degree turn in personality.</br>  <br> playing the religion card again <br>Pathetic. This proves that I won.<br><br><br>True, after all we special persons (that is you) know that "well written = what I like!".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>My bad, she's not an AV actress but a former idol.

You learn something new every day.</br>  <br> Majority of nips are EM fags <br>Maybe the normalfags who have never read the manga nor even watched the anime, but the majority of readers are ELFujos.</br></br>  <br>Majority of nips who watch/read snk are fujoshits actually.</br>  <br>Majority of the nips are fujo shippers</br>  <br>If your criteria of being interesting is "badass who cuts shit up", Mikasa and manlet are by all rights the most fascinating characters in this manga.</br>  <br>Never gets old.</br>  <br>Only official fujobait is Levi. The rest is just opinion.</br>  <br>Yes, bland, he's even blander than the manlet.</br>  <br><br><br>Not counting delusional fujoshits of course.</br></br></br>  <br> If your criteria of being interesting is "badass who cuts shit up" <br>That's the only thing Erwinfags ever talk about, of course it is. They don't even know what bland means.</br></br>  <br>That's true, manlet has more going to him than being a strong commander.</br>  <br>Using x words now makes a character bad?<br>Bland is not what Erwin is, maybe your taste is bland.</br></br>  <br>Maybe you should direct that post to yourself, Erwin is bland.</br>  <br> that played Mikasa said she doesn't see EM as romantic. <br><br><br>and later that week she was attacked by a buttmad shipper who tried to shave her head</br></br></br></br>  <br> gets shit done  <br> gives no fucks  <br>A sad sack yes but not bland</br></br></br>  <br>Except that he is, he's just the "badass" commander. The worst thing is that he's also a Gary Stu.</br>  <br>maybe it's because she knows EM doesn't have a chance of happening</br>  <br>You contradicted yourself. You can't give no fucks and be sad at the same time. He's bland compared to the rest of the cast, maybe barring Mikasa. I think even Miksasa has more to her than Erwin even if she's all muh Eren.</br>  <br> He's just  <br>And that's the only thing you can say.</br></br>  <br>Manletfujo pls all manlet has going for him is being STRONK. I was hoping he would be push back into the background like Utgrad but oh no give that dumbass the serum and in our faces once again</br>  <br> You can't give no fucks and be sad at the same time <br> You can't be x and y! <br> What is character depth </br></br></br>  <br>Erwin is the most bland male character in the manga.</br>  <br>He's a badass commander who has done more for the SL than anyone before him. His intelligence is unparalleled by anyone else in the series, and he orchestrated the plan that removed the fake, corrupt government. He has "Humanity's Strongest Soldier" at his beck and call, and everyone - EVERYONE - listens to him, for a reason.<br>He's far from bland.<br><br><br><br>Eren gets a scratch and Mikasa goes BSOD. She can't even compare. Erwin's badassery goes far beyond cutting shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing more to say about him.</br>  <br>So he isn't allowed to be a human?</br>  <br>He's right though, Erwin is just a badass and only Historia could beat him is Sueness levels. The difference is that Historia is a complex character and Erwin is not.</br>  <br>I can't be x and not x at the same time, thanks for proving you don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>If being bland is being human then he is.</br></br></br>  Stop h8, post best boy  <br>Everything you said means he's only a badass.

I guess "Beast Spear lol" is the only way to go with it.</br></br>    <br>Beast Spear.<br><br>It's always Beast Spear.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's "Beast Spear Lol" because it has been shown to fly around before.<br><br>Is there a single story arc that isn't referenced in this conclusion? A single character that isn't referenced? The only one I haven't seen is that girl from the inn that the idiot duo's black hair guy was dating.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Besides her? I don't think so. Maybe those dudes from Karukuri Museum but the guy from high Speed Eater popped up. Well the spirits popped up instead of her. Hell, even Harpy-chan popped up again.</br></br>            <br>  The only one I haven't seen is that girl from the inn that the idiot duo's black hair guy was dating. <br><br>I think I saw her in the previous volume, but I should check it.</br></br></br>                <br>Well damn, I didnt see this coming at all</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I FUCKING FOUND HER<br><br>probably</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Oh, yeah, that's the image I  was talking about.</br>  <br><br>Yeah I think that's her.</br></br>        <br>I didnt expect them to be this useful</br>    <br>Fucking TsunTora.</br>                          <br><br><br>It's really nice that Fujita found some space for the girls' interactions and for motherfucking ghost dads.</br></br></br>        <br> That smug as fuck Hakumen in the bottom panel </br>              <br>I had seen the same eyes in Magi, a lot of times</br>              <br>And so, Karakuri Circus was born</br>      <br>Just me, or does NotSatsuki have some sort fo hair fetish.</br>        <br>I just love how this guy goes out. Goddamn they're totally cutting him.</br>  <br>Christ that fucking face</br>   everyone's joining for the last battle <br><br>This only reminds me of the end of Violinist of Hameln where they made fun of it.</br></br>            <br>TORA NO</br>    <br>FUCKING BRUTAL</br>      I finished this a week ago and didn't get something. The point of the barrier is to prevent MnH from sinking japan. But they awaken it prematurely and japan is sinking anyways, which  results in the two osa sacrificing themselves to prevent the collapse. So isn't the point of the barrier literally moot since the bakemono could have killed HnM and stopped the collapse with the two osain the first place?   <br><br>best part for me</br></br>    <br><br>But they seriously can't beat HnM. And even if they did, it required a ton of them, not just two, to become the stone which would not really have been possible if just one side did it.<br><br>I think even if they did somehow killed him, Japan wouldn't really sink thanks to HnM's body becoming the rock or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best part is the whole series. it was a lot of time that a manga gave me a truck of emotions like this</br>      Is anyone going to sub this?  <br>no one's gonna watch it so there wont be subs</br>  <br>She's voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki so I'm gonna watch it even if there are no subs.</br>  <br> no one's gonna watch a show where Miyuki Sawashiro orgasms over food </br>  food anime?  Too bad, I really wanted to give it a go.<br><br>Oh well, I can still watch it without subs.</br></br>  Mori?  Mori said he might.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gWT<wbr>CvExxOtE</wbr>  [ ]<br> dat pshuuuuuu at the end </br></br>  <br>Oh man, I'm already excited for this, seems like a fun laid-back show, just what I need.<br><br>Better get studying Japanese again.</br></br></br>  Can prostitutes be moe?  Where is that greasy negro that makes a fast speed webm of the first episodes?  <br>Both those posts said the word "most", if you hate magical-school-harems no one is asking you to watch every one of them. Though surprisingly, some people actually enjoy their hobby, and don't hate anime.</br>  Is this the next Black Lagoon?  <br>but most of them are the same you weeb<br><br><br>reading the plot summary</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and gangsta intrigued me. That's why I watched the first episode you fucking retard. Why do you even assume I didn't like the first episode? I liked it.</br>  Is Strike Witches getting a 3rd season or no?  <br>Western based Witches keep the surname of their archetype<br><br>Some Eastern Witches have different surnames from their archetypes though. But its mostly due to alternative readings of their names or playing around with the characters in their name.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Some of the Orussian witches do have feminine surnames.</br></br>  <br><br>How are Seven Seas for translations? I've been interested in picking up the Fuso Sea Incident manga but I'd like to know what the presentation and stuff is like buying.</br></br>  <br>Because some Orussian witches are based on Female Pilots?<br><br>I honestly know jack about Russian naming Nuances. I know some people who has Lionel and Isla as their surnames. And while their surnames phonetically sound soft, it never really hit me to think of it as "Feminine" surnames. How the fuck does a "Feminine Surname" work?<br><br><br>For SW, I only have One-Winged Witches and SW 1.5 manga but its otherwise pretty good. Translation is A-OK and their consistency with In-Universe technical terms is fine enough.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1wT7myyhA9mRIw-854u8kz5oOPBuq2BhigU<wbr>qt3KEPs-o/edit?pli=1</wbr></wbr> <br><br> i'm gay </br></br>  Vol 3.<br>TV: Left<br>BD: Right</br></br>  <br>You know what they say. Graffiti fans are the worst.</br>  <br><br><br>WHY WOULD YOU REMOVE THE FAN AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></br></br>  <br>FAN DEATH AVOIDED!</br>  <br>That's a Korean myth, not a Japanese one.</br>  <br> adding MORE steam <br><br>thats not how BD´s work</br></br></br>  How do you organise yours? I limit 10 to high priority and 10 to medium priority. The rest are all low. When I complete a show, I then choose one show in medium to upgrade to high, then one low to upgrade to medium.  <br> very fast <br>After the files are made available to the general public but speed is only a minor concern anyway.<br> in HD <br>Resolution is not the same as quality.<br> and don't have annoying ads. <br>So it doesn't come with additional shit. How nice. In return you have a shitty player, shitty subs and a bad quality video file that is probably watermarked too, possibly hardsubbed even.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is it such a big deal? So long as it is watchable, it should be okay. It's just anime.</br>  <br> It's just anime. <br>Get the fuck out of /a/.</br></br>  <br>So long as you keep the screenshots out of /a/. it's not a big deal.<br>If you use streaming or MAL, keep it out of /a/.</br></br>  I watch 4 shows at a time, whether it's Anime or not. Right now I'm finishing up Space Dandy Season 2, Psycho Pass and recently started Trigun after finishing Kiniro Mosaic. With those three, I also watch a non-anime show. I have a pretty big backlog, but when I'm done with one show, I consider it done and pick one from my backlog to go into the four shows I'm currently watching. I watch at least one episode a day to keep the progression going and so I don't get lazy and don't watch anything. <br>I've only recently started watching Anime for real so I'm sorry if my casual and shit taste offends anyone.</br>  One Piece 792 discussion.<br>So, next chapter we finally have some international reactions again?</br>  <br>Usopp can't be recognised or it'll break the liar story dealie he's got going on. His hometown can't ever know that he's a famous pirate and has gone on crazy adventures when he returns.</br>  <br>Yes, and Mr. 2 broke out himself, every agent reunited, and most escaped. Considering this is Doflamingo, something similar could easily happen with one breaking out or Doffy having more men behind the scenes.</br>  <br> implying most fishmen wouldn't simply be executed <br> implying most fishmen aren't shitters that arent worth Impel Down <br> implying Arlong wasn't just barely worth Impel Down even during a time when Fishmen were at their peak of piracy <br> implying several giants weren't imprisoned (and said to be in consideration Dorry and Broggy) in Impel Down <br><br>Jinbei and Fisher were special cases, even Hody only managed to be almost New World level, and it took him overdosing to the point that his life was shortened to a few hours at most.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, God Ussop is a thing that would spread, it would be funny to see if it gets twisted somehow. It would be enough if Kaya and the Usopp pirates became aware of it. That being said another "World Reaction" would be great. Cameos from characters we haven't seen in a while.</br>  <br> filler reaction faces <br> purposely slow pacing <br> "these chapters" <br><br>So is this your first or second arc? Or maybe you read the first couple a few years ago and all at once instead of weekly?</br></br></br></br></br>  Subs for episode 3 are out<br><br>Next episode in 2 days<br><br>Final episode this autumn</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but go to /m/ if you want them on time.</br>  So we've got Euro Britannia trying to become independent from mainland Britannia with Shaing in control and Lelouch likely going to need to be sent back for a reboot from Charles.<br><br>How is Europe going to be taken over by mainland Britannia? Is Charles just going to send all the knights and spam units?</br></br>  <br>Why would you want spoilers of an episode we're not going to see for months?</br>  <br> months? <br>It's going to be on PSN in two weeks</br></br>  <br>I guess you didn't watch R2 as it's revealed how they conquered entire western EU.</br></blockquote>]
