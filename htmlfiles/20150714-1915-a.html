Disgusitng.  <br>How do you know Konata doesn't?</br>  Which heroine is actually the best for Shirou?  Bazett  Not Sakura, because she perpetuates his white knight faggotry.  <br>Good thing Sakura isn't a heroine.</br>  Saber  <br>So you want him to become a boring faggot with no ambition? Sakura end truest end.</br>  Sella.  <br>Sakura.<br><br>Said by Nasu</br></br></br>  Not this shit again.  Saber.  Ilya  <br>EVERYONE</br>  <br>None because Shirou is a worthless faggot that should die a lonely, meaningless death.</br>  <br>This is your fault Kerry.<br><br>You could've stopped all of this if you were there for Shirou more.</br></br></br>      <br>Objectively Rin<br>But i still prefer saber as his bride</br></br>  <br>The one Nasu didn't write a route for.</br>  RIN A BEST!  <br>I wholeheartedly agree.</br>  <br>Consider this: every girl is at her worst in her route, Illya has no route and is the best girl.</br>  If talking F/HA then Bazett, if talking F/SN Sakura with side fuckbuddy with Rin when she's not pleasing other men. Saber is also close fuckbuddy  <br>Right, just an educated prostitute.</br>  <br> Consider this: every girl is at her worst in her route <br><br>he's right.</br></br></br>  <br>Swords</br>  <br>Saber is too forced.<br>Sakura is nuts.<br>Rin is love and life.<br><br>So, Rin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rinfags are the worst.<br><br>Just say. <br> Rin  <br><br>You don't need to shit on the other heroines, it's totally unnecessary and uncalled for</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura.</br>  <br>Pic related<br><br>Better than being a <br> NATURAL BORN SLUT </br></br></br></br>  Saber is undeniably best girl but I honestly don't think she's best for Shirou. Rin is probably a better fit and I haven't played HF yet.  <br> Just say.  <br> Rin <br><br>R I N</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rinfags don't listen to logic and reason or have common decency, it's really no surprise.</br>  <br>The other girls are not even trying though.</br>  30 replies in and no fucking Rider.    <br>RIN<br><br>I even went to my window and yelled RIIIIIN with all my might.</br></br></br>  <br>Which heroine is the better kisser?</br>  <br>As much as I think UBW is abysmal, I'd actually say Rin was at her worst in HF just for how needlessly fucking cruel she was up until almost the very end. Not that /a/ will ever criticize her for it.</br>  <br>I like Rin and I think she was a cunt in HF.</br>  <br>Is not that she was at her worst.<br><br>Is that she's shit. She's nice to Shirou 'cause she likes him but that's it. She doesn't get along with anyone else and she doesn't want to either.</br></br></br>  <br>She was fine, you're just a worm-loving faggot.</br>  <br>Thats not a route, thats an alternate timeline where the 5th Holy Grail War did not happen. Nasu is just lazy and does not want to write a route for Illya. He basically says he is going to let the fans do it.<br><br>If we go by that logic, Fanfictions Chaos Theory is real Illya Route.</br></br></br>  <br>If she's shit why is she so best?</br>    <br>That's how Rin rolls, she tries to hide her true feelings behind her magus persona, but she always fucks up at the most important time. She just couldn't stop betraying herself and realised at the worst time possible.</br>  has nasu ever stated what sort of end he wants for his chars in general? which girl would most likely let him have the most relaxed life and die of old age?  <br>Never. What's the point of having multiple canon endings then?</br>  <br>Well obviously going with Sakura will likely lead to Shirou living the longest, since he's not particularly planning on heroing it up.<br><br>He wrote the epilogue to UBW though saying Rin and Shirou will get a happily ever after.<br><br>And of course he did LE too, which tells you Fate Shirou's story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Point is Illya's at her worst in Prisma. She can't even be called the same character.</br>  <br>Luvia. She's the richest, the purest, and can best handle a jackhammering.</br>  Any good place or group to torrent FSN?  <br>Fate: afterlife with Saber in the Garden of Avalon<br>Unlimited Blade Works: Clock Tower Adventures<br>Heaven's Feel: Househusband to Sakura with Rider as a fuckbuddy</br></br></br>  <br>Both Fate and UBW are very similar, but in UBW Shirou actually leads a happy life with Rin, while he's all alone in Fate.</br>  <br>Well there's always eternity avalon with waifu, which doesn't really happen in UBW</br>  <br>Sakura. Saber's and Rin's only worth are as the simple sluts that the MC gets to fuck at the end of a route.</br>  <br>Fate: Literally eons alone after his death until he meets Saber in Avalon.<br>UBW: Leaves Rin to become Seigi no Mikata<br>Heaven's Feel: Gets married and has a happy family</br></br></br>  <br>Saber because idealistic boy and girl trying to reach their unreachable utopia is beautiful.</br>  <br>luvia</br>  <br> UBW: Leaves Rin to become Seigi no Mikata <br><br>Nope. They're going to adventure together. Shirou might go it alone sometimes, but he's always gonna have Rin.</br></br></br>  <br>My fucking nigga</br>  <br>It's never said tho, she stays in the clocktower and he goes full Seigi no Mikata. <br><br>Everything else is just fanfiction</br></br></br>  <br> Heaven's Feel <br>Don't you mean dead or a doll?</br></br>  <br>She outright says she's going to travel with him in the epilogue. She may go back to the Clock Tower at some point, but they're still promised a happily ever after.</br>  <br> Being this much of a secondary </br>  <br>Of course there is. Saber is fucking shit.<br><br>Everyone else is ok even Luvia.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu wrote episode 25 as an intended epilogue to UBW, so its story could fully stand on its own.<br><br>UBW, in the VN, had to cater to the fact that HF was after it, but the anime needed to have a solidified ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura<br><br>He gave up his ideals to save her. She'll also be a loyal house wife and take care of him forever. Along with Rider. <br><br>They'll be having naughty threesomes for the rest of their days to keep his fancy magic body powered up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But fucking Merlin is there, I bet they can't even fuck.</br>  Why not all of them?  <br>Saber is love.</br>  <br><br> Saber <br><br>Worst character, worst heroine. I think Sakura and Rin fags can both agree.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Merlin isn't DTF </br>  <br>Isn't Merlin trapped in some stone barrier?</br>  <br>Rin, every other girl go home.</br>  <br>Literally the worst type of no personality girl. Try again. I bet you like dead fish too.</br>  Saber of course. Saber is the one girl that will support his ideals no matter what. They're going to be kickass super heroes and save the weak together.  <br>No. I like Rin and Saber.</br>    <br>I like Rin too if that makes you feel more secure, anon.</br>  <br>Saber is the cutest.</br>  <br>Nah Saber and Rin are good.</br>    <br>Was there ever any doubt?</br>  <br>And who put there? Arthuria? Fucking kek.</br>  <br>Saber is literally a fucking enabler for his dumb as fuck ideals. Also worst girl ever.<br><br>Sakura is a doormat and an enabler but at least she has some kind of kink to her and big tits.<br><br>Rin is his other half and personality check.<br><br>I mean like what other choice do you have?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who is best  homo end?   <br>Yup, I like Saber, Rin, and Ilya. Sakura's the only one I can't stand.</br>  <br>Kirei. The only gay answer.</br>  Best girl  <br>If you don't ship Kotomine x Shirou, you are wrong.</br>  <br>My King of course. I mean he did get blinded by her beauty.</br>  <br> dude got sliced through the chest with a sword <br> hit his wound like the dumb tsundere you are </br></br>   not shipping Emiya and Shirou   <br>He was already healed thanks to Rin and her special ointments.</br>  Saber because she and him are equally retarded  <br>Merlin's crazy dude. When confronted with the problem of giving Arturia an heir, instead of just commanding Lancelot to Lance her Lot or whatever he decided that the most logical course of action would be to turn his liege into a futa. Avalon must be some kind of weird sex dungeon.</br>   no Caster route where she helps him to realize his UBW potential and allows to use it to the fullest, maybe teaching some ancient magic secrets of mana conservation as well so he can use it freely   Sakura if only because he stops being a retarded chuunibyou with his world saving hero of justice cockgarble.  <br> Sourichiro-sama will never teach Shirou his martial arts </br>  <br> Complaining about getting hit with a pillow <br>How gay can you fucking be?</br></br>  <br><br>WoB is best saber</br></br>   you will never have qt Rider gf to protect you <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br> ending is literally them rule breaking all servants and giving them another chance in life </br>  <br>Isn't Medusa a mistake? She was supposed to be a perfect loli goddess like her sisters but look what happened.</br>  <br>He gets to bone pic related</br>  <br> Shirou following his ideal <br>Fuyuki is saved with minimal casualties<br> Shirou gives up his ideal for Sakura <br>Entire neighborhoods get devoured tons of people die</br></br></br></br>  <br>Secondaries are truly the worst. <br>UBW anime brought redditors all the way here<br><br><br><br>This would've been a great idea, really would. <br>Caster helping Shirou to become great, hell maybe she even finds a way of getting EMIYA crest giving shirou cool Kerry powers</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rin, with Saber as a close second. Fuck Sakura.  <br>I'm okay with this.</br>  <br>HF is fucking shit just because it finally gave Rin some actual factor for being a heroine and they fucking piss it all on Sakura.</br>  <br>He would turn Shirou female and Arthuria male (again) just because.</br>  <br>Doujin when</br>  <br>Nasu's fault Rin doesn't have a route that focuses on her instead of sex only.</br>  <br> best <br>Don't let me sic Gawain on you. Clearly my King is the best.</br></br>  <br>Where's Shinji?</br>  <br>I actually love Rin and Issei's dynamic.</br>  <br> Shirou tracing and modifying rule breaker under Caster's training to serve as an arrow with homing effect <br> becomes master of all servants in the war <br> creates a justice squad and travels around the world wrecking shit with his team of legendary heroes while having the highest degree of control over his own circuits and UBW possible to him </br></br></br>  <br>I love the fact that Issei can tell she's full of shit and lying about her entire personality.<br><br>Shame he gets side character treatment. I really have no fucking idea why Nasu does that. It's like Arihiko(I hope he gets more relevance in Remake)</br></br></br>  Shirou x  high jump pole  OTP  <br>Too OP, pls nerf.<br><br>Also Archer could've done that. Well I won't ever stop if I start thinking about how Archer could've end the way in a day if he wanted</br></br></br>  <br>The point of Rin is that she's too nice for her own good, why can't people see it? She's literally the perfect waifu.</br>  <br> She's literally the perfect waifu. <br>This.</br></br>  Rin is canonically perfection.  <br>About rule breaker and homing. We had a similar thread the other day but Archer.<br>Trace Hrunting + Caladbolg II = Never misses and lelnuke<br>Trace Hrunting + Rule Breaker = Never misses and sever connection<br><br>Trace Hrunting + Caladbolg + Rule Breaker = Never misses, lelnuke and severs connection <br><br>Last one for OP fags like Berserker or Gil</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>not even a true rinfag, all rinfags like saber as well</br></br>  <br>Stop samefagging already, you've been doing it for like half an hour. It's painful to watch.</br>  <br> people share same opinions <br> they must be the same person <br>That anon's typing style isn't even the same.</br></br></br>  <br>nigga you dumb</br>  <br>Isn't the first Hrunting, like, weak as fuck?</br>  <br>Except there's one faggot repeating the same thing for like half an hour now. Also counter isn't getting bigger</br>  <br>counter did get bigger you retard. Just stop posting already</br>  <br>Ayako.</br>  <br>But it never misses.<br><br>Try and stop hrunting with caladbolg attached.</br></br></br>  <br>I really don't know what you're talking about since I've been posting Rin Saber shenanigans as well and that posting style you're referring to is fairly new.</br>  So not becoming a nigger is the reason why UBW Shirou surpassed Archer?  Best Girl<br>Best King<br>Best Servant<br>Best Idol</br></br></br>  <br>Medusa please. But I agree.</br>  <br>Shit, meant Medea</br>  <br>He will become a nigger anyways. Projection is too much for Shirou, even if it's rooted in his RM.</br>  <br>Came here to post this. I wasn't expecting it to be the first response.</br>  <br>But he would need some sweet time to do all that shit. It seems... complicated.</br>  <br>Ah, don't worry about that. They do have similar names.</br>  <br>No he becomes a nigger because he has to burn himself getting mana.</br>  <br>She's too old anyways.<br> mfw Bazett was younger than me when I got into all of this </br></br>  <br>He's an Archer. He just needs to snipe faggots not go h2h. <br><br>Also he turns Caladbolg into an arrow in like a second, it can't last more than 5-6 to do all that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the Prisma Illya approach, isn't it? I think it's a valid approach too.</br>  <br>In UBW and HF he won't have to burn himself because he has mana battery waifus.</br>  <br>She's not too much older. 24 to his 17/18.<br><br>I was more thinking about the whole being idiot magus killers and being able to mutually bond over their Kirei opinions.</br></br></br>  Not Dirtyanus Tohsaka.    <br>Hrunting's power was based on how much juice he was putting on it. At full charge it's enough to pierce an incomplete Aius so it's still damn strong.</br>    <br>None because all things in this world without exception belong to Gil</br>  <br>Shirou killed him and took everything that belonged to Gil.<br><br>Now all things in the world belong to Shirou</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, she is annoying as fuck. If only she was more honest and stopped the tsundere crap. It is only perfect for you if you are a masochist.</br></br>  UBW Shirou vs Kerry. For the kill both of them  <br>Avalon obviously doesn't work for any of them</br>  <br><br>Reminder.</br></br>  <br>UBW Shirou displayed far better physical capabilities than Kerry, especially in the anime, but the fact is I don't know if Shirou is ruthless enough to really try and go all out against his dad.</br>  Rin is the sweetest.  Guys help this guy clearly needs a hand.  <br>I'm playing this in my phone, Starting second week now. <br><br>It's good, I don't really like the combat because it's dumb(you can beat anyone as long as you don't miss) but it's not that I hate it either. The story has been entertaining for now and Archer is great.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rinho the sweetest</br></br>  <br>Kerry. <br><br>Shirou will recieve his letter of challenge, go to the designated point and then get shot in the head. <br><br>That's if you're taking personality into account. If you're just doing an empty, featureless void and removing personality. <br>Probably Shirou since without Avalon, Kerry isn't going to be using any of the good Accel while Shirou has UBW hax BS plus Rin's Crest mana for meeting the bare minimum requirements for UBW.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>They wouldn't fight in the first place.<br><br> But Kerry would have an advantage due to Time Accel/Origin Bullets </br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't know there was RN for PC. <br><br>Downloading at the moment. Hope the patch works well enough</br></br>  <br>Sweetest Rhino.</br>  Sakura  <br> For the kill both of them <br><br>I never indicated there was prep time tho, so of course there isn't. <br><br>They do fight because I just made them fight.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>   When will this thread inevitably turn into Tsukihime General?   <br>I think it really comes down to who gets a good hit in first. Kerry shoots an origin bullet? Given what we've seen though, Shirou's pretty fucking superhuman. He could get the drop on the guy if he doesn't hesitate.</br>  <br>Time Accel wouldn't be enough of an edge considering his swords let him fight at Servant speeds. Origin bullets may be a problem if he doesn't dodge them or if he pours mana to the swords (which normally isn't a factor since they have no maintenance cost).</br>  <br>I meant to say "Kerry shoots an origin bullet? Shirou's down."</br>  <br><br>Shirou is too fast and too strong to Kiritsugu.<br>Sure he could get fucked by Origin bullets but they won't ever hit him so yeah. <br>Kansho and Byakuya = GG Kiritsugu<br><br><br>When people bring the fact that shiki can kill servants</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course its Gilgamesh</br>  <br>If there's no prep time then you're basically using the "Dropping them in a featureless void" scenario since Kerry's use comes from being Batman.</br>  shirou is pretty hot tbh  <br>Shirou is a fucking idiot though, he constanly busts out a strengthened wooden sword in UBW, only to have it break in the first volley.<br>Time Accel &gt; Load Bullet &gt; Shoot<br>That's if Shirou is able to block the Calico with a wooden sword.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would Kiritsugu use an origin bullet on an imp that only uses 2 circuits for his magecraft? A normal .30-06 should do the job.</br>  <br>I would agree to that, but if they're going all out, an origin bullet isn't out of consideration.</br>  Guys, guys...  did you notice how the thread went from "ok" to "shit" when Zerofags appeared?   <br><br><br>That won't ever touch Shirou cause sanic</br></br></br>  <br>But Shirou is also Batman.<br><br>At least Archer is anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou is slower than Kotomine who couldn't dodge Kiritsugu's bullets.</br>  <br>Shirou in pic used doesn't go around with a wooden sword.</br>  Shirou would wreck, Kerry can't deal with swordspam, the only possible thing I could think of would be him sneaking a bullet in with Square Excel  <br>Archer is Green Arrow. Still a normal guy who just uses a bunch of different arrows for different purposes. <br>Though it doesn't explain Sword or Shield usage but that given we call Kerry "Batman" while he uses guns unlike the modern Batman, I think we'll let it slide.</br></br>  <br>No he's not.</br>  Male rider  <br>Luvia</br>  <br>Are you stupid? That's standard for Shirou in all routes until he finds out how broken his projection actually is. Hell, UBW is the route he exploits his projection magic the most since he only brings it up a few times in Fate and it's killing him in HF.<br><br><br>He's more like TV Green Arrow back when he was going through his "giving no fucks about killing" phase.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't Kerry more like the Punisher than Batman?</br></br>  <br>Waifu war faggotry to Power level faggotry pretty normal for a fate thread. Or are you that new?</br>    <br>Yeah but the tard never thinks to open up with Kanshou &amp; Byakuya, until he has to fight Archer.<br><br><br>Kerry is Batman because he's all about planning ahead and outsmarting his enemies, kind of like how Batman can win any fight with enough prep time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends. Which Punisher we talkin' bout?<br><br>I'd say the most they have in common is the methods of which they fight, not so much in the morality of it.</br></br></br>    <br>But the shirou used in the pic doesn't go around with a wooden sword</br>  <br> Filename <br> Not JETS <br><br>One job</br></br></br></br>  <br>True, but I'm still unconvinced that he'd take an opening volley from the Calico unharmed, since Kerry would probably strike first.<br>Projection takes longer than the amount of time it takes to aim and shoot.</br></br>  shirou couldn't be more in love with saber unless she were a literal sword  What is Mikiya's Origin? Also why is he so  Best  ?  <br>Reminder that UBW features sword NTR.<br><br>Shirou gets double teamed by two hot Chinese twins.</br></br></br>  <br>Normalfaggotry is his origin. <br><br>And he's second best, after Shizuki. Him and Shizuki however would be the best good cop/dumb cop routine.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sakura.<br><br>Even Nasu ships them together.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hello.</br></br>  <br>Rider is too perfect for Shirou. She needs a person who would truly love her and wouldn't talk shit behind her back.</br>  <br/>  <br>Sakura. Other girls either leave him or like old men.</br>  <br>oh no now they can't get married!<br><br><br>there needs to be an anime a la Upotte! but with midevil weapons</br></br></br></br>  <br> or like old men </br>  <br><br>"One that will never hurt others, more so than anyone else." <br><br>Is this the reason he gets a Harem of crazy ladies? I mean it makes perfect sense that crazy people would feel atracted to him being normal. <br><br>Also is Shiki a fusion between Shiki and Mikiya?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rin.<br><br>Saber is fine but sakura is just terrible. Thankfully she doesn't even end up with him in one of the HF endings and the other ending he's pretty much fucking Rin and Rider on the side.</br></br>  <br>Gil-ko, naturally.</br>  <br> Is Shiki a fusion between SHIKI, Shiki and shiki? </br>    <br>Boner.</br>  <br>Even his daughter wants to fuck him.<br><br>Also pls delete dirty red from that pic, she should just die already</br></br></br>  <br>Modern Punisher, haven't read his early comics yet.<br><br><br>Isn't Archer that as well, just with an Arrow Oliver Queen approach?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Shirou gets the hots for Swords. <br>Shiki gets the hots for slicing people. <br><br>Why can't they be normal?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can love bloom in the battlefield?</br>  <br><br>How would Shizuki and Mikiya hang out with Shiki and Shirou?<br><br> Will there ever be a Carnival Phantasm segment with the 4 of them dealing with Harems? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Archer is the same, but there's less of the "un/underpowered guy takes down super powered villains" thing.</br>  <br>Because being normal is Mikiya stuff.</br>  <br>Sure. How Gil-ko gets interested in Shirou is up for debate though.</br>  <br>She just became a beautiful and ripe mature woman, unlike her shitty sisters. It's funny that she is considered to be a failure while in fact she managed to become even more perfect than her sisters.</br>  I was pissed when Archer didn't pull out the longsword in the UBW series.  <br>Is Mikiya the biggest bro out of all the TM Protagonists?</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>I was pissed when Archer didn't pull out his dick and fucked shirou</br>  <br>He's not really normal either.<br><br>His obsession for Shiki is not normal at all</br></br></br>  <br>Shiki comes up with a crazy plan. Shizuki goes along with it not knowing better, Shirou goes along with it because he wants to help. <br>Mikiya just warns them how much of a bad idea it is and when it backfires on the four all the girls let Mikiya go free because they know about how good a guy he is which makes Shirou and Shiki despair while Shizuki just doesn't get why he's getting beaten up.</br></br>  <br>Take your penises elsewhere, we're discussing swords.</br>  Ooooh, swords.  <br>Wrong webm woops</br>  <br>Does Lancelot watch American Football?</br>  <br>None of them. I guess Sakura or Illy would be the closest but all of th emaemil are an ill fit.</br>  <br>l-lewd</br>  Best.  <br>Is every single girl of their respective harems involved?</br>  Which rank would you give to this if it was a hougu. <br><br>I'd go for EX.</br></br>  <br>I can see him being a godlike reviser he can put that A+ agility to work.</br>  <br>A++ with arondight</br>  <br>I think he'd play on the  JETS </br>  <br>arondight doesn't give him modifiers just a rank up.</br>  <br>she's best girl, but I don't think best for shirou</br>  <br>She is best and good for Shirou.</br>  <br>Definitely Seiba.</br>   Arondight <br>Does sombody have the official info on exactly what's this power is besides being a literal dragon slayer weapon. Is it a plus or a rank up in power to A-&gt;EX? If that's the case that's just stupidly broken.</br>  <br><br>P O E T R Y<br>O<br>E<br>T<br>R<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wouldn't go A-&gt;EX, it'd rank up to A+ (I think the scale goes up to A++)</br>  <br>Even more.</br>  if shirou can project rule breaker with archers arm in heavens feel, why cant archer project it in UBW to break rins command seal?  <br>It goes from A to a higher A. +s are a modifier not a rank.</br>  <br>He can.</br>  <br>Is your neighbor a fan of Tohsaka-senpai?</br>  <br>Second: Mitsudzuri.</br>  <br>He can, but why would he?<br>Everything went as planned.</br></br>  <br>Third: Caren.</br>  <br><br>I forgot its nasu writing this. I'll just stop asking questions</br></br>  <br> I forgot its nasu writing this <br>I don't understand how nasu's at fault for there being no need for Archer to break his contract with Rin himself.</br></br>  <br><br> Saber is fucking shit. <br><br>And yet Rin did fuck her, and liked it. A lot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if archer did it himself he wouldn't have all that time to monologue about shit and not kill shirou</br>  <br><br><br>Archer wanted to have Rin win the Grail War and make a contract with Seibah.</br></br></br>  <br>why</br>  <br><br>Rin is a slut, ofc she likes fucking her.</br></br>  <br>Cause<br>Saber&gt;&gt;Archer <br>Rin can get Saber back to her prime strength.</br></br></br>  <br>He was her servant. And he is Shirou, so he likes her, and if Rin has Saber, she has the highest chance of winning.</br>  <br><br> Sakura <br><br>Perfection.</br></br></br></br>  Rin is best girl but I genuinely just enjoy how Shirou and Saber learn from each other more  <br>Archer's plan was to give Rin the Saber she wanted in the first place, take his revenge on Shirou, and hopefully poof out of existence, and if not that, just sort of die anyway.</br>  <br><br><br>And you're calling Nasu stupid? Archer states straight out the holy grail war is a sham, he knows what it really is and that there's no point. He's been summoned primarily to stop the war and kill Shirou. Why the bloody fuck would he break his partnership with Rin and try to get Saber under Rin's control?<br>That's some fanfiction bullshit right there.<br><br>Where was this stated?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's some fanfiction bullshit right there. <br>He outright says it in the route though.</br></br>  <br>Who knows.<br><br>He's stronger than Seiba too so it doesn't make much sense even if you say he wanted Rin to live.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's not a slut, she only sleeps with two other characters, the same as Sakura. Do we call Sakura a slut?</br></br>  Either Sakura or Saber, since both get Shirou to drop his ideals and stop being a fucking robot.  <br> He's stronger than Seiba too <br>I'm out. You're retarded.</br></br>  <br> Fate Shirou  <br> Dropping his ideals <br>Nigga what?<br><br> He's stronger than Seiba </br></br></br></br></br>   want to invest in the F/SN VN <br> don't want to see Illya's heart operation in UBW <br> don't want to see Bazett's sufering in all routes <br><br>Should I jump straight into F/HA ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not EX it just goes A+E that is all.</br>  <br> Nigga what? <br>He only followed them out of respect for Saber, the shining light he strove to reach. He admitted he didn't care too much about anything else on the final night.</br></br>  I love Rin!  <br>No.</br>  <br>Bazett has no screentime in F/SN.<br>Just read the fucking thing.</br></br>  <br>He didn't drop them though, even though he wanted to run away with Saber and never look back he realized that was something Saber could never approve of and so he lived his life as perfect as he could to live up to Saber.</br>  Can anyone here tell me if I should apply the patch with the Vita OST to the game?<br><br>What does it change? Is it improved versions or will I regret it if I do it?</br></br>  His best soulmate is Arturia, since they're pure of heart and both long for an unreachable ideal. She's the fairy-tale ending.<br><br>Rin is Shirou's perfect foil, who will allow him to live true to his nature but also keep him in the realm of sanity. She's one in a million and Shirou getting with her is like winning the lottery: unfeasibly lucky but possible unlike beans growing stalks to the giants in heaven and and pedo wolves dressing up like grandmothers in our world.<br><br>Sakura is a terrible match for Shirou as a person. However, she's the type of girl you settle for when the dreams and grand aspirations of our youth die into bitter jaded regrets, and Shirou's best chance of not dying alone without the Grail War shenanigans. When you give up, when you quit trying, you choose Sakura.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Broken by a quincy without power.<br>I'll give a B at most.</br></br>  <br>You don't see Bazett in Stay Night and HF is Illya route</br>  <br><br>Didn't Nasu say prisma is Ilya route?</br></br>  <br><br>The only way for Saber to win against him is <br>1: Having Avalon<br>2: Archer standing like a retard waiting for laser beam to hit him or fighting hand to hand instead of grilling her from distance. <br><br>Let's not forget Archer can kill Berserker FIVE times WITHOUT Unlimited Blade Works<br>2:</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate Shirou did not drop his ideals secondary if anything he followed them the hardest of any Shirou.</br>   rinfags are making me hate rin more. <br><br>This is why ilya is best</br></br>  <br> Shirou is voiced by Uryuu  <br> Has Ichigo's hair <br><br>Did Nasu actually rip off Kubo?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the sword is not only strong, it also transforms the user and gives it more power. <br>Also he's stronger than Arturia<br><br>Also<br> Mangafox </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason he didn't drop them was because Saber wouldn't approve. At that point, Shirou's ideals became 2nd to Saber. <br><br>It's similar to Sakura's case and if Saber wanted Shirou to stop his shit and become a housewife, he would have done it on the spot. <br><br>That's why Saber said Sakura was similar to her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice blog and no one cares.</br>  <br>Ilya is gonna win the Miyubowl.</br>  <br>yep</br>  <br>Maybe hypothetically, but Saber would never want him to do that in character. That's the whole point of them meeting in Avalon, they can both just be together and not have to worry about anything else.</br>  <br>This feels like reaching but whatever floats your boat. The fact is that he didn't drop them in Fate.</br>  <br>He is right tough.</br>  <br>FAGGOTS TELL ME</br>  <br>Then why post ?</br>  <br>To tell him that he fucking cancer for blogging.</br>  <br>If you downloaded the Realta Nua of the game, install the latest patch from Beast's Lair. You will still have the original OST, but you will be able to use the new one.<br><br>You will also be able to view the censored, and uncensored version of the H scenes, with the mosaic'd parts of the CGs removed.</br></br></br>  Which class would he be summoned in?<br><br>This Goku is already idiotic strong so I should clear up that someone actually CAN summon him</br></br>  Jesus fucking Christ, all the shit taste in this thread<br>Fuji-nee is the only right answer, you plebs.</br>  <br>Not really, doesn't matter how many times you retards spam "It was the rinfags" that doesn't make it true specially when it's just baseless accusations.</br>  <br>Yeah I have all that. <br>I was wondering if installing the vita OST deleted the old one. Since it doesn't i'll install it.<br><br> Also which one do you prefer?</br></br></br></br>  <br> pole <br>Lancer<br> nimbus <br>Rider<br> oozaru <br>Berserker<br> energy attacks <br>Archer<br>Caster</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The original OST is better in my opinion</br>  <br>Both are pretty good. The Vita soundtrack has higher production quality than the original, though some of the original tracks still sound a bit better to me due to instrumentation choice.</br>  <br>I'm not sure berry's power comes from the sword but rather from berry himself.You know the shit with how he's a quincy/hollow/shinigami plus his bankai is Juha Bach and all.</br>  <br>So he can be summoned in every class?<br><br>Also Oozaru can be achieved anytime so it doesn't really need to be berserker unless you want to summon the giant monkey which would need like 50 Illya's. <br><br>I think Oozaru should be left as a true hougu or something</br></br></br></br></br>   Gilgamesh :: — Heh, mercenary, aren’t you. Just when it seems your poor vitality won’t return, all it takes is talking to a woman to restore your spirits. The three great desires are indeed powerful, aren’t they? Now you’ve slept and fulfilled your wants to your heart’s content. All that remains is to satisfy your tongue. Shall we buy ingredients from the kiosk? I don’t mind treating. <br><br> Wha, what is this goldy saying…! She just made me tea in the infirmary! I did nothing untoward! <br><br> Gilgamesh :: I know. It was what you call an AUO joke. You’re in a better mood now. But there’s no helping it. I give you special permission. By nature, I was on the side that would be brought down by humans like you. How many times have I been betrayed by a fearless face like yours. Perhaps it is some karma that now I look at that same thing up close like this. It makes one want to speak of the irony. <br><br> As if mocking himself…no, as if entirely amused, he smiles. …I can’t, believe this. I know it’s only his whim, but still right now he’s thinking of me with pride — <br><br> Gilgamesh :: It seems you’ve awakened, mongrel. I’m not speaking of a momentary sleep. I mean the state of your soul. Your face seems to have come alive. That worthless shadow which has hung upon it has fled to the netherworld, then? What audacity. What base vulgarity. What — a human face it is, and full of worthiness. We go now, then? This situation has roused my interest too, let us take arms in earnest. In human history, god-killing has been the duty of kings. If our opponent is one who would ascend the throne of the gods, then there’s no chance I will not come to fight. <br><br>Such a bro<br><br>Most bro character in all of Fate clearly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both are pretty good. You can do one route with the original OST and then one with the Vita one. Then choose your favorite for the last one.</br>  <br>It's not reaching. I'm just saying he put Saber before his ideals, just like he did with Sakura. They're more similar than you think.</br>  <br>I don't think comparing Saber to Sakura is a compliment.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks I guess I'll go for original first</br></br></br>  <br>The sword itself is a hollow and is more powerful than Ichigo himself(or was at least) so of course it has power</br>  <br>Whether or not you think so, Saber makes the comparison herself.</br>  Heaven's Feel felt like the "True" ending and route to me, so Sakura.    <br>Just imagine, in a 100 years from now there will be at least 10 more variations</br>  <br>Then clearly Rin is the only option.</br>  <br><br>You are right. Sakura is much better so it is way more than a compliment.</br></br>  <br>An older woman.</br>  <br>That's everyone except Sakura.</br>    <br>He dropped his ideals for Sakura it's very different.</br>  <br>Monkey OP pls nerf</br>  <br> Rhino <br>I'd rather not.<br><br><br>How is it different? His ideals can't co-exist with Sakura, so he drops them. His ideals can co-exist with Saber and she wants him to keep them, so he does.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They key thing being that he keeps them during the Fate route. He's not just being a superhero for one girl like in HF, he's saving everyone in the world that he can.</br>  <br>Rin is a cat, not a rhino. It's canon.</br>  <br>Now that's an Anti-Emiya Shirou Heroic Spirit.</br>  <br>In one he gets broken after he drops them and in the other he doesn't. Plenty difference there.</br>  <br>She really isn't, also her fanbase is the most annoying. Trying to shove her down everyones throat, constantly repeating phrases and "PERFECT, BEST, PERFECT", and usually shitting on the other girls before going back to "But RIN"</br>  <br>That's because she is perfect. Deal with it.</br>  <br>He was a pretty huge faggot in the 7th film, lowered my opinion of him a bit.</br>  <br>I'm still not sure why you're trying to bring up that strawman. I'm saying Saber is like Sakura in that she made Shirou place her on top priority over his ideals. <br><br>The thematic difference is that Saber supports his ideals whereas Sakura wants him to stop.</br></br></br>  Is Shirou OG?  <br>Sakura is a snake or rabbit in canon, but people shit on that saying she's a worm instead.<br><br>You can't sway the crowd saying something is canon.<br><br>Saber is also in a weird position being both a Lion and Dragon.<br><br>I'd sooner say she's a lion than dragon though, because I'm not getting a dragon feeling from her at all. If you're saying you see a dragon then you're probably lying, its clearly a lion.<br><br>Sasaki always gotta give people animal associations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Has anyone else noticed how polarizing characters like Saber are? The competent kuudere who doesn't care about romance until MC comes along. I'm not saying that's bad, but their sole draw as a character is that they're meant to be waifu'd, so when somebody isn't drawn in by that meaning, they generally dismiss them as boring. Saber doesn't have any real drawbacks as a character, but she's too boring for people who don't like her as their chosen heroine, as opposed to Alexander or Gilgamesh or something.</br>  <br> strawman <br>He didn't give up his ideals in Fate, end of story.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty much just the same 2 guys who do it though. Most of the Rinfags left and these guys post the same images (check the filenames and numbers) over and over, giving Rin a bad rep.<br><br>It's going to be interesting seeing the flip in popularity once HF comes around with Rinfags being the ones on the defensive after all this hatred.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura doesn't want him to stop you fucking retard. The situation led to that you fucking secondary, that broke her.</br>  <br>The hollow is inherent to Ichigo,that's why he got his body hijacked by him in the byakuya fight.If another person wields the sword he'd only have the getsuga and the speed boost that's pretty meah and the blade isn't even durable.</br>  <br>Okay, and? What does that have to do with my post? Are you having a seizure or something?</br>  <br> It's going to be interesting seeing the flip in popularity once HF comes around <br><br>You know HF is the thing that actually makes people dislike Sakura, right?</br></br></br>  <br>I think you might just be retarded that's all.</br>  <br> Strawman <br> Get called out <br> Falling back to insults <br><br>Almost too predictable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> strawman <br>That word doesn't mean what you think it means.</br></br>  <br>If you summon a servant with Tensa Zangetsu i'm pretty fucking sure it'll be Ichigo don't you think?<br><br>also the blade is durable, Jugo is stronk</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not really. That's only the people that didn't understand the thematic of the VN.</br></br>  <br> . Most of the Rinfags left and these guys post the same images (check the filenames and numbers) over and over, giving Rin a bad rep. <br> Rinfags being the ones on the defensive after all this hatred. <br>According to you there's no Rinfags so what hatred are you talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>If you me to reply more to your bait, you're going to have try harder or we'll stop here.</br>  <br>You can understand the thematic of VN and dislike her character. In fact people that like HF tend to dislike her.</br>  <br> According to you there's no Rinfags  <br>That's not what I said, at all.<br><br>English is hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> whereas Sakura wants him to stop. <br><br>That's not even what happened<br><br>People keep saying this<br><br>Sakura loved his ideals more than anyone. It was an ironic and dramatic route. Sakura was at her worst in her route, an entire point of her route is that this isn't what she's normally like and she isn't this dark, he always just knew her as that nice girl that saved him more than once, but its all about loving someone at their worst when they were like family. Normally she supports his ideals, anything that says otherwise in the game is the dark influence starting to spread. Not that anything really said that, he gave up his ideals of his own will while she said "You'll regret this, don't do it".<br><br>There's an entire moment in the game near the end when she remembers her original wish when she once more has a lucid moment, and tries to do something drastic to make up for what she's just realized she's done or else she can't keep going. Her last moments as herself as she's afraid of what she's becoming she tries to end it taking down Zouken as he laughs at the attempt.<br><br>Entire route is about her afraid of what she's becoming, she can't control this, its the reason she ordered Rider to protect him from anything including Sakura herself. She could no longer trust herself or her feelings, she was becoming something, but originally she loved and deeply supported his ideals<br><br>People always miss out on a lot here, I find it strange like a lot didn't read it or skipped around.<br><br>The route is nothing but irony at times. Her luck is bad, she loved that sturdy and upright boy, therefore irony strikes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one actually hates Sakura before HF. They have to play the route to dislike her.</br>  <br> That's not even what happened <br>The fact is that he dropped his ideals and never gets them back. That's the difference between Saber and Sakura, and further compounds their contrast.</br></br>  <br> Most of the Rinfags left </br>  <br>This. Sakura is largely ignored before HF and is hated because of HF. HA redeems her character somewhat, but HA sucks so whatever.</br>  <br>How does this in any way, shape, or form, imply that there are no Rinfags left?</br>  <br>Read your god damn sentence it implies there's only 2 fags left.</br>  <br>So why did you say<br><br> According to you there's no Rinfags </br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't being literal seriously this isn't hard.</br>  I'm pretty sure there are more than two people on /a/ that like Rin.  <br>Nah, everyone hates her now it's the new meme.</br>  <br>If you weren't being literal, then the rest of your sentence in your original post makes no sense.<br><br>I'll just assume you're certifiably insane and we'll stop here.</br></br></br>  <br> There can be more than one person that likes something, but the ones that all like her don't have the same sort of post style that does a few things in particular and shitpost.<br><br>There are people that like Saber and Sakura, and there are also people in those camps that mainly just shit post as other posters say "They're all like this, fuck them all, I hate every side of the fanbase that isn't ours, especially those fucks".<br><br>Just like that, there are also Rin shitposters that tend to pop up and get recognized.<br><br>There are also people in the middle each time that push things along because this is all they want. Since this is basically the most autistic fanbase around. Every side of the fanbase has shitty people for sure.<br><br>Probably especially Rin at the moment due to the new anime, which made things mainstream. That's always a warning sign, like with Zero.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Exactly my point. Only the people that didn't understand her character and by extension the closure/moral of the VN are the ones that don't like her.</br></br>  <br>There's only a few people who spams the same images and goes<br> RIN A B E S T <br>And shit like that though.</br></br></br>  <br>There's barely any newfags in the threads though. This fanbase is very rude to them.</br>  <br>You can understand Sakura and still hate her, anon.<br><br>I understand Hitler's motivations thanks to Mein Kempf, but I still think he's a terrible human being.</br></br></br>  <br>You sure are an expert on tracking the posting styles of anonymous people on the internet talking about their favorite anime waifu.</br>  <br>So? There's also people that post Luvia and old men and I don't see you complaining on that.</br>  <br>Not really I love HF but she is the worst part of it.</br>  <br>People that post about old men are mainly just anti Rin, rather than pro Luvia I'd say.<br><br>They use her as a figure head, but probably don't even know who she is at times. Also people forget that the old men thing used to be a different meme, when some guy tried to force it in every thread. It just sort of combined with the Luvia thing because people took her as a figure head against Rin by chance.</br></br></br>  There are less than 100 people in this thread. Realistically, how many folks regularly post in TM threads?<br><br>We've all probably talked to each other several times.</br></br>  <br>Are you stupid? I love Rin and I post Luvia, whoever takes that seriously is dumb.</br>  <br> Several times <br><br>Its every day</br></br></br>  <br>That's anti-Rin and posted by everyone. I don't think we have even 10 Luviafags on /a/.</br>  <br>It's always around 100~150 in general threads. But it sometimes doesn't even reach the 60 mark.</br>  <br>You probably actually post Luvia though, don't you? Not just "Old Men OHOHOHO".<br><br>Those are the people I've mentioned; some people might know who Luvia is, but when it becomes spam that's all it is for some people.<br><br>Notice how it stopped entirely after Prism was gone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's anti-Rin <br>Not really it's from a fucking doujin no one gives a shit. It's just a bump meme.</br></br>  Luvia is the people's heroine. A bit character in the VN that slowly grew in popularity and relevance as the years went by. One line in FSN. A minor role in HA. A playable character in UC. A side character in Prisma. And finally a serious mainline role in Case Files. So that begs the question.<br><br>LUVIA ROUTE WHEN?</br></br>  <br> Not just "Old Men OHOHOHO". <br>No that too. No one takes that seriously dude.</br></br>  <br> LUVIA ROUTE WHEN? <br>Just replace Rin with Luvia in UBW. It shouldn't be all that different.</br></br>    <br>Yeah you right but I was talking about the blade power in itself.With Ichigo that would be a good blade because compatibility but if Shirou or Archer tried to trace tensa zangetsu it would be a shitty blade unlike excalibur for example that's why I gave it a B.<br>Also i want to see a berserker Ichigo now.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, and it's not posted by Luviafags, but everyone. <br>Were you not the one saying I should be hating Luviafags too instead of just Rinfags?</br></br>  <br>No all I am saying is that why are you complaining about faggots praising Rin when there's a ton of shit posting memes in this threads already.</br>    <br><br>Why do you hate her then? I can assure you most if not all your arguments about her character are wrong.</br></br>    <br>Not that guy, but a big thing with this fanbase is taking an image of a heroine, posting something shitty, and people will attribute the hate to that side of the fanbase and remember that shit as it adds up. Which is why reverse posting is a big thing as well.<br><br>One guy can pretty much ruin things for most people who like something here.<br><br>Rin has some annoying posters that do the same things every thread that's been building for awhile, people are starting to attribute it more towards her fanbase, or in particular to "Those two guys" at the moment still. Its not at too bad of a point, but its taking a toll as it builds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Like how you remember when Saber had daily threads for awhile, some posters got annoyed about that and attributed that all Saber fans are shitty, and started spamming those threads with cuck stuff until the guy stopped.<br><br>4chan is all about "Fuck that guy" and "Stop liking what I don't like" in different ways.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is boring and annoying in her route.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but I disliked her because I felt like I wasn't personally invested enough in her character to care about her.<br><br>She's only really prominent in the last story, but by the time HF rolls around, she's face first upfront, and what we see about her is not particularly likable. She's constantly suffering from some woe until the end of the story where she's now in a villain role.<br><br>You can harp on about the challenges of "love", and how "love" is seeing the darkest part of a person, or whatever that quote from Nasu says, but you need a firm foundation to care about her before you see the deeper faults, and that's where I think she fails as a character. If she had the prominence of Saber and Rin before HF, and you got see her brighter points, there'd be much more of a reason to want to save her once HF came around, but she was basically absent for 2/3rds of the game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the nature of anonymous image boards.</br>  <br><br>All I am seeing in threads is one guy repeating "It's the rinfags fault" but whatever man you guys can keep being autistic.</br></br>    <br>The blade cannot exist without Ichigo because it's something that comes from inside him and he himself made.<br>It's not something created by anyone else, it's a part of his soul. <br>Tracing it it's impossible. The only thing Shirou could do is create a Katana that looks the same.</br></br></br>  <br>Also I'd like to see Nasu creating a war with famous Shonen heroes as servants.</br>  <br>Based St.Parasu</br>          <br><br>Sorry but that is a retarded reason to HATE a character unless you are a kid. If you said dislike that would be different.</br></br>  <br>Sakura is really short.</br>    <br>It's a better reason than most reasons usually posted here. I don't have to give you details.</br>        <br><br>Ok.</br></br>          <br>I saw Kirei and I actually started laughing uncontrollably.</br>      Why is fate so boring? I can read Tsukihime/Mahoyo no problem but Fate gets annoying really fast. <br><br>Is it the voices? Are the voices annoying me?</br></br>      <br>I am pretty sure Shirou could trace tensa zangetsu,the zanpakutoh creator was able to take tensa zangetsu and communicate with it that means it can exist without Ichigo but no point arguing about that I'll give you the point here.However Ex rank is too much you're implying it would be as broken as Ea?</br>  <br>I like where this is going.</br>    <br><br><br>The only place this is going is kissus, probably.</br></br></br>  True pairing.  <br>Well, it was pretty good this way.</br>  <br>At the end of HF she's 21cm shorter than Shirou</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>There's no translation for this comic, is there?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bro!</br>  <br>If you learn kana you should be able to red most of it.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/VLrt313lNBE  [ ]  <br>Looks weird as shit at 60 fps.</br>  <br>Because she too is an Archer who needs to find the purpose of her life and she needs saving from the lesbian menace.</br>  <br>The nanny Archer series was really fun to</br>  Wormslut a shit  <br>I watched all fate in 60 fps(Sidonia too) but I have to agree it's weird the first time you see it. <br><br>Definetely better tho.</br></br></br>  <br>Should have gone with the older sister.</br>  <br>Sakura is the canon match</br>  <br> canon match <br>Secondaries.</br></br>  Reminder that Sakura is perfectly fine without Shirou, and that she goes on to have a nice, healthy, deeply sexual relationship with her brother.  <br><br>Try harder.</br></br>  <br><br> Secondaries. <br><br>Says the secondary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah. Guy cut Bazz's arm off and a pillar in half from a distance.</br>  <br>Did someone say <br>BAIT?</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/89982/26b00ef<wbr>67f/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/89985/86daa55<wbr>cd6/</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>All she needs is a cock.</br>  <br> People disagree with my shitty taste it must be bait <br>Eat shit</br></br>  <br>Not this retard again...</br>  Saber and Rin are perfectly fine without a fucker. So Sakura is the best option.

They say that it's progressive also easier to draw and animate. Japanese are lazy, they want to make things faster but not better in terms of quality.</br>  <br>There's also The Overcoat</br>  It says in the article he talked to reporters but instead of talking about his new movie (which they were most likely there for) he took the time to criticize the government.<br>What the fuck is wrong with him?<br> "Miyazaki, what will your new movie be about?" <br> "Fucking Abe, that weak spineless bastard, If we had our emperor back..." <br> "...M-Miyazaki?" <br> "And did I tell you about the OTAKUS?

I think, he's going to create less detailed but better animated piece. Just a guess though.<br><br><br>2D sell in Japan. It's creators' will to produce 3D, their consumers prefer 2D.

He's spending 3 years developing a 10 minute short. It's obvious he's going to be spending those years experimenting, and coming up with his own way of doing things, as he always has.<br><br>One thing I love about the Japanese is that they insist on doing things their own way. They take something that exists, study it, and come up with something we haven't seen before.

Which movement to what anime are you saying?<br><br>"Movement that fits anime" is really, unhelpfully vague, since nobody would think Spirggan's movement would fit in the FLCL style.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Erm. That part was about japanese 3D artists actually. <br><br>Ah. We appear to have gotten crossed at some point.<br><br><br><br> &gt;Even Americans don't have those techniques yet <br> Uh... actually? We sort of do, <br><br><br> I'm talking about skills, not software. <br><br>No worries, we all get mixed up sometimes, that's just why you lost me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The idea is not new. <br>New for him, you sperglord.</br></br>  <br>He wanted to make this piece long ago. Suzuki stopped him and forced him to create Mononoke. It was like that with Ponyo 2 and Wind Rizes too.</br>  <br> Japan hasn't got any quality 3D except of Harlock so we have nothing to compare. <br><br>Harlock and Saint Seiya.<br><br>Coincidentally, their two highest budget movies.<br><br>Both CGI.<br><br><br>Actually? Pretty close, Harlock was budgeted at 30 million, Frozen was 150 million.<br><br>Average CGI movie is a little higher than that, normally 165 million, though. Even stuff like Lion King, adjusted for inflation, is only 68 million, and the highest budget ever for a 2D animated film is Treasure Planet at only 135 million, which is laughably crushed by pretty much every 'big' CGI production, from Cars 2's 200 million, or Tangled's monstrous TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION. <br><br>There's no denying, shaking or rejiggering, 2D is much, much, MUCH cheaper than CGI at present time, by a very wide margin. A gorgeous film like Ernest and Celestine is only going to run you about 6.4 million, but even farted out low budget garbage like Rio 2 is going to run you 90 mil.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>apparently paperman was all smoke and mirrors that fell to pieces and look liked shit the second they finished their shots and tried anything else with the technology, it's why we haven't seen anything since<br><br>don't know if true though</br></br></br>  <br> Harlock and Saint Seiya. <br>Toei is not the rest of the industry and those are not 4.5 hour series but movies. Also Harlock flopped, am I right?<br> Harlock was budgeted at 30 million <br>Ha. You can make an awesome 2 cour 2D anime for that amount of money. Like mindblowing.<br> 2D is much, much, MUCH cheaper than CGI at present time <br>Anime studios make cheap 3D. Also it's much easier to produce than 2D.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why wont Miyazaki ever retire? <br><br>Because he is a slave to Disney.</br></br></br>  <br>If he was, we would've never left Ghibli. this short has nothing to do with Jewsney and never will.</br>  <br> don't know if true though <br><br>Er, no, not true. They went to work on a short called "Feast" after that, and used the development time to work out the bugs it had with the colors.<br><br>Won and Emmy and everything, not that that's worth anything considering.<br><br><br> Toei is not the rest of the industry and those are not 4.5 hour series but movies. <br>Correct?<br> Also Harlock flopped, am I right? <br>Also correct, and Saint Seyia underperformed.<br><br>Well, they underperformed by the standards of the much higher budgets, would have been considered successes if they had a, say, "Naruto movie" level budget.<br><br>This is why Japan sticks to the cheap stuff. Only time Toei or a company likes it goes for CGI is when they get a whiff of Americabucks, where CGI makes so much money it's not even funny and 2D hasn't had a 300 mil success from fucking DISNEY in over 15 years.<br><br> Ha. You can make an awesome 2 cour 2D anime for that amount of money. Like mindblowing. <br><br>...You could make SEVERAL well animated 2D animated movies for that, actually?<br><br>They won't sell abroad, or even in Japan compared to stuff like Frozen, but you can make them.<br><br>Which is what they do, so... not seeing your point, hope you will elaborate.<br><br> Anime studios make cheap 3D. <br><br>Cheaper than American, sure. Cheaper than their standard 2D, noooo.<br><br> Also it's much easier to produce than 2D. <br>Nope. Common myth people think because things with computers are confusing, but it's just as difficult to produce a CGI feature thanks to the various jobs, things like Render Farms, and other expenses that inflate the costs well above 2D's maximums.<br><br>The reason 2D died in the United States is because CGI was making buckets of money that 2D never even came close to making, not because it was cheaper. The opposite, even, Disney was VERY reluctant to change despite Pixar and Dreamworks making money hand over fist, but they just couldn't hold out.<br><br>Japan is heading that way with Frozen and Big Hero Six's successes, and they know it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nope. <br>Yes. 3d is much easier to draw (just make one model per objet forever!) and animate, it's obivous. Anime creators say so repeatedly, that's why almost all mecha is 3D now for example. They don't want draw details on every frame and such, that's what Takahashi Ryosuke said not so long ago.<br><br> The reason 2D died in the United States is because <br>Because they just switched to 3D, no?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what are these ameribucks you speak of? Japan never made any money abroad, all they get are shitty license royalties for chicken feed</br>  <br> Again, they DO, they did it with Paperman and Feast to perfectly emulate a 2D drawing <br>You're delusional if you think either of those actually look like 2D drawings.</br></br>  <br> You could make SEVERAL well animated 2D animated movies for that <br>Princess Mononoke: $ 19.500.000<br>Ponyo: $ 27.600.000<br>The Wind Rises: $ 30.000.000<br>So no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Big O second season was made after Cartoon Network request and on their money. Just sayin. Also Stan Lee.</br>  <br> 3d is much easier to draw (just make one model per objet forever!) and animate, it's obivous. <br><br>Again, nope.<br><br>Even if you do take into account how much easier it can be to animate a single model, it's much harder to make those single models than it is an animated character.<br><br>Okay, since you don't seem to know how it works, quick crash course. Skip past the setup concept art stage, that's pretty much identical between 2D and CGI works, right up till they're ready to make the first model. Okay?<br><br>2D, start drawing and start animating, that's ready to go.<br><br>CGI? First off, we ship off the final design to the modelers, the guys who are going to sculpt this thing out of the finished stages. Gotta get as many details down as you can, changing this later is VERY hard for reasons I'll get into later.<br><br>Okay, all made up and modeled? Good, got it. Now we ship it off to the Texture artists, who are going to make all the skin and clothing and whatever, anything not the model has to be textured and you have to get this texture right. Metal is by far the easiest to do, because organic textures have to take into account it's going to stretch slightly, like skin, which looks weird if the texture isn't made right. This is why robots are, comparatively, a breeze, especially when they're in anime and they don't have to work on 'realistic looking' metals, they can do flat colors with a reflective shader and boom, so much easier. Not so much if you want to do a face, and there's another reason for that.<br><br>cont</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay, your modeled, you're textured, and for arguments sake we're going to say all the shaders have been preprogrammed in, now we get to move on to the riggers! Any part of that thing you want to have the ability to move HAS to be properly rigged, and weighted. If it isn't, that model is going to deform and look terrible. There are ways to cut costs, such as giving people stick figure limbs like Illumination does with it's Despicable Me franchise, but facial animation is going to take a ton of practice to get perfect, otherwise you're going to look awful.<br><br>And then, once you're all rigged up, got your weights, sent it back for some texture touch-ups because this and that didn't deform right, and everything looks nice and natural, walla! You can now ship it off to an animator who can use his marrionette skills to move every single bone and weight in accordance with how the character is to be animated, and he can cycle through unrendered scenes and do touchups before being shipped off to the good old render farm, where it will take 40-90 hours to render a single high definition frame, depending on the budget of the film. Unless you're a live action movie, then it gets even higher.<br><br>And that is for ONE MODEL.<br><br>Now, here's the part where people get confused, I want you to imagine that process, done for literally every, single, solitary character. All of them. Anything that moves in the scene, period, from doors to levers to anything that moves, has to be rigged, if it breaks the inside of it has to be textured to look like a convincing break, if it crumbles it has to look like rubble, and any final models have to be made long before any of this can happen and be put into a scene.<br><br>See why people stick to 'robots' now? <br><br>It's not easier, and it's not cheaper.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Again, nope. <br>Your word aninst a famous director. H-m-m, which one should I choose?</br></br>  <br>I'm convinced he survives on otaku tears, similarly how Stan Lee takes the life-force of other celebrities to sustain himself.</br>  <br> Ernest and Celestine: 6 million <br> Secret of Kells: 6 million <br> The Illusionist: 17 million <br><br>So... yeah, you could.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> high definition frame <br> anime <br>You don't know anything about japanimation, dude. They use cheap simple animation + shitty low res render. Way simpler and faster than drawing by hand.</br></br></br>  <br>Were they made in Japan?</br>  <br>commissions only ever go to production I.G, and they usually just use the money to outsource the whole thing<br><br>at best if you want to make a show that will be popular overseas, it's to sell merchandise, and since official merch sells like crap even that is relegated to stuff with big video game franchises like Dragon Ball</br></br></br>  <br>No, but I didn't want to get into a "Lol you think that's good animation" war from pointing out something like Naruto the Last has, according to Google, a budget of 971.344.80 dollars... which means you could make over 30 of them. <br><br>Just picked ones with actually visually impressive animation.<br><br>That and I couldn't find and Evangelion budget.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just looked this up because you got me curious. The Dam Keeper used 3DCG to help when laying out scenes, but the actual animation isn't 3D.</br>  <br>Because anime is a mistake he won't bother to fix as long as he gets paid.</br>  <br>Google isn't turning up this interview, would you mind helping me out here?<br><br>And, follow up, was he only talking about animating vehicles and robots, or animating in general? Cause animating a person is night and day different than a robot.</br></br></br>  <br> No <br>Then your comparison is useless.</br></br>  Probably because Goro is a failure.  <br> Cause animating a person is night and day different than a robot. <br>Yes, a robot has many details and moving parts and a person don't.</br></br>  <br>Hey, quick question, which do you think is harder to animate/eats up more render time<br><br> Moving parts on a robot <br><br>Or <br><br> Cloth that moves or does literally anything besides look like solid plastic <br><br>The answer may surprise you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's talk about real things. They don't animate clothes or anything much in Sidonia for example. And yes, it's harder to draw a detailed robot frame by frame.</br>  <br>What does any of that have to do with your standard TV series tier CG?</br>  Watching traditional animation die has been extremely unpleasant and I resent living to see it.  <br>Not him, but people have more moving parts in CGI due to how many bones you have to put in their face for proper expressions.<br><br>This is what a barebones basic facerig looks like, you have to put in more bones if you want more exaggerated expressions like what SOL anime normally does.</br></br></br>  I can't find it, it was on /m/. Need to go now. Remember, kids, that 3D anime is shit. You can't make anything as great looking as Patlabor movies or Ghibi with a normal budget 3D.<br><br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IsMT<wbr>pSDAGxM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> people have more moving parts in CGI <br>Not in anime.<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iK1j<wbr>lQNcmns</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Let's talk about real things. <br> They don't animate cloths <br><br>So, lets NOT talk about real things, lets talk about inorganic things like robots, as opposed to real things like moving cloth.<br><br>That's fine, just confusing.<br><br>  They don't animate clothes or anything much in Sidonia for example.  <br><br>Because they are organic, moving things and would be very expensive for a CGI show, as opposed to a show like Bleach which loves it's cloth shit.<br><br> And yes, it's harder to draw a detailed robot frame by frame. <br><br>Okay, even condeing that and pretending I didn't not only point that out but detailed reasons why robots are so much easier(No, 'moving parts' is not an issue when its a robot and you don't have to worry about rigging in depression like skin) in that big double post, what makes you think that having one section be easier than the 2D way would make it cheaper?<br><br><br>You do realize that they still probably have that bone structure, right? At best, they're missing the nose and upper cheek rigs, lips and eyebrows and eyes have to be exactly like that for it to work.<br><br>Yes, it does have to look and be THAT complicated for that basic a result.<br><br>No, it's not fair.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Harlock was budgeted at 30 million <br><br> Ponyo: $ 27.600.000 <br> The Wind Rises: $ 30.000.000 <br>Harlock has much more details sfx, breddy good animation and fps. That's the real thing. Hands down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always love how they put a shit ton of pistons in there, just to show off the animations.</br>  <br> they still probably have that bone structure <br>If robots don't then they're harder to animate. If they do, it's the same.</br></br>  <br> So, lets NOT talk about real things, lets talk about inorganic things like robots, as opposed to real things <br>Real things = real anime that was made.</br></br>  <br> Because they are organic, moving things and would <br>You talk about some theories like with paperman that MIGHT become relevant SOMEDAY. But now it's just a 3D with some bad filters. And 3D in anime is a lazy garbage.</br></br>  <br> Harlock has much more details <br><br>Bullshit.<br><br>Harlock's animation is not even close to the level of Ponyo, and if they had even dreamed of fluid physics anywhere near this it would have inexplicably added 5 million to the budget just for that dream.<br><br> SFX <br><br>Name me ONE effect in Harlock that looks anything like the fish scene.<br><br>And Ponyo was still CHEAPER<br><br><br> If robots don't  <br><br>Correct, robots, having no facial expressions, don't<br><br> then they're harder to animate. <br><br>...I... what?<br><br>If Robots DON'T have that detailed bone structure for their facial expressions, each of which have to be carefully manuvered to not look derp-faced(and, looking at it, they didn't even succeed all the time) they are HARDER to animate?<br><br>Giving you the benefit of the doubt and say typo.<br><br>But, no, a facial expression will always be harder to animate than moving parts on a robot, because facial expression will always require symmetry and subtlety on a different leve.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey, did you hear about the new Miyazaki short? It took him 3 YEARS to make!  <br>Looks almost the same shit to me in terms of quality.</br>  <br> ...I... what? <br>Google skeleton animation. And anime facial expressions are always primitive and they follow same old several patterns. Forget your Disney, we're talking about the low tier here.</br></br>  <br> Congratulations </br>   le I hate miyazaki meme <br>Love this meme.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Which do you think added a ton more render time to this scene, that detailed surrounding area or Captain Harlock's cape? Remember that, in this scene, that cape does not look remotely real.<br><br>Again, the answer may surprise you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obivous that animating people is more time consuming for movies. But for TV series it's just the opposite. People look like shit and their faces are barely animated.</br>  <br> Forget your Disney, we're talking about the low tier here. <br><br>This IS low-teir for cgi, you think Elsa's rig looked anything like this? or pic related? Damn, I wish I could find my old pic, it made her look like she fell face first into a pile of spikes.<br><br>This rig in pic related is what you would need for basic expressions, it even leaves out the nose and upper cheeks entirely too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now we can hate him for 3D. I hope he will make something bad, I need more fuel for my hatred.</br>  <br>Harlock is awful looking. Even the ships look worse than Battlestar Galactica let alone the characters.</br>  <br>Looks simple as fuck like I said. And it's the hardest part because every other objet is a simple bunch of fixed shapes that you just need to move. Also no keyframes. 3D is much, much easier for anime than 2D.</br>  <br>I remember someone saying that the making of Yozakura Quartet was dirt cheap, I'd like someone to provide number though.</br>  <br> But for TV series it's just the opposite <br><br>Damn, any /co/ browsers have Giancarlo Volpe's tweet on this? I dunno if he'll listen since it's an amiercan produced show, even though outsourcing and so on, but he said straight up It's literally the opposite, that 3D costs DOUBLE what 2D does, even when comparing simple shows like pic related to Young Justice.<br><br><br> Loos simple as fuck like I said <br>Somewhere, a 3D animator is crying.<br><br>It's not simple.<br><br> And it's the hardest part <br><br>Now that, at last, you got right.<br><br> because every other object is a simple bunch of fixed shapes that you just need to move. <br><br>...Sure.<br><br>Which means that, of course, even at it's most basic, it's way, way harder to do a person than a robot, and this is assuming you<br> Don't do cloths <br> Don't do anything complicated with the face <br> Don't give him any moving parts on his hand, like a gun or something <br> Don't give him any clothing that moves <br> Don't give him anything that needs a lot of rendering, like detailed hair  <br>and<br> For the love of god don't go near water <br><br>Sure, if you strip down literally all of that, CGI is cheap, and easy.<br><br>...Now apply that to 2D and tell me that wouldn't be so fucking cheap the only debate would be if you wanted to pay for it or an extra large pizza, and so much easier to do you could do it in Flash animation and would see zero difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Mah nigga.<br><br>I'm willing to crack my monitor for this fistbump.</br></br></br>  <br> amiercan produced show <br>Unrelated to this topic.</br></br>  <br> In 15-20 years anime will become full 3D. <br><br>I will stop watching anime when that happens. Fuck that. Anime's main appeal over Western animation these days is the fact that most of it is still animated traditionally.</br></br></br>  <br> more impressive <br>That's really more of an opinion. Is there any study or survey or something related to what people think of 2D to 3D animation?</br></br>  <br> japanese CG is magically different </br>  <br>That's not what he was saying. He was saying the higher-ups believe that the audiences find it more impressive, without making a statement that this was the case.</br>  <br> Sure, if you strip down literally all of that, CGI is cheap, and easy. <br>You finally understood. Bravo.</br></br>  <br>Which one are you talking about? The mediocre first series, or the actually pretty decent 2nd series?</br>  <br>Thats exactly how I like my medicine and my cars, based on witchcraft and no airbags.<br><br>Ill take my polio please with a side of sail-powered travel and a good VHS to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah I see. My bad.</br>  <br> most of it  <br>I wouldn't go that far.</br></br>  <br> CG is more impressive <br>That's so retarded.</br></br>  <br>His emphasis on theory seems to imply he thinks they're wrong, actually.</br>  <br>Of course I'm taking about the shitty first series when giving an example of well animated 2D TV series you shithead.</br>  3D modeller/Lighting artist that works on TV shows here (albeit not very good ones)<br><br>Any questions I can help answer?</br></br>  <br> muh technical advancement <br><br>Leave that to videogames, idiot. Not everything needs to change.</br></br></br>  <br>You are literally retarded. Japanese 3D is different because it's a fucking different country with different prices and standarts. They make student tier shit for pennies compared to professional US shit that costs and makes tons of money.</br>  <br>Low quality bait tbh.</br>  <br>How much more does it cost compared to traditional animation?</br>  <br>Whether or not they're wrong, or what he thinks really, all that really matters is how the show does I guess.<br><br>Since the Green Lantern got canned, I don't think it was very well received. Then again I'm thinking of the film, not the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Payroll?</br>  <br>Damn, knew he would run off from that.<br><br>Oh well.<br><br><br> . Is there any study or survey or something related to what people think of 2D to 3D animation? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>The 10 year period between 1999(which was Pixar's firs big 'hit') and 2009 in the American Film market, when a variety of 2D and CGI animated movies were released in tandem and one consistently made more money of the other regardless of quality.<br><br>The turning point was either Atlantis getting Shreked, Treasure Planet bombing so hard it left a crater in Russia for some reason, or Princess and the Frog getting utterly decimated by Tangled.<br><br>Long story short, exectuives looked at all the successes of CGI and were like "Oh my gosh, kids want CGI!" and the lack of successes in 2D and went "Guess they DON'T want that!"<br><br><br>...So you're just going to keep pretending that sentence after didn't happen?<br><br>Okay. Didn't think you had a comeback to it anyway, but was kind of hoping you did just to see what you would pretend was super expensive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madhose, what have you done?</br>  <br>The issue is that the market isn't broad enough to tell whether or not traditional vs cg methods actually affect audience turnout. It's all specious conjecture.</br>  <br>Have you ever animated something with cells? We need to know if it's easier to make 3D than 2D or not.</br>  <br> It's all specious conjecture <br>Right, that's what I had in mind.</br></br>  <br> Since the Green Lantern got canned, I don't think it was very well received. <br><br>Different problem.<br><br>Because it was CGI, it was expensive as fuck, and thus needed toy sales. One problem.<br><br>Green Lantern TAS came after Green Lantern, the movie.<br><br>Green Lantern, The Movie bombed really, really, really hard.<br><br>So hard, no toys got sold, period.<br><br>Which meant a bunch of retailers had a bunch of Green Lantern Movie stock they couldn't move rotting on the shelves.<br><br>So when it came time for orders for GLTAS toys, guess how many picked up and ordered them? Yeah, zero.<br><br>Nobody wanted to touch this toxic name, so no toys. No toys, no incoming revenue. No incoming revenue, no possible way to cover a CGI show's massive costs.<br><br>So they canned it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pretending that sentence after didn't happen? <br>What sentence? I'm talking about anime, not theoretical stuff. If guys that make anime say that it's easier, I trust them. And all 3d I see in anime is lazy ugly shit like in Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>Do shows usually set up lighting in an environment so that it looks correct for pretty much every angle, or do they change the lighting for each individual shot?</br>  <br>Exactly this, I'd forgotten about it. <br>Thanks, Anon.</br></br>  <br>WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING LIES. Simpsons, Futurama and South Park are 2D. A load of other popular shows are 2D. BTFO.</br>  <br>I'm not sure on a per episode basis, especially in japan. But the average artists for tv animated shows at a junior level is looking around 30-40k a year. Mid level being around 45-55k.<br><br><br>I'm a mid level artist 3-4 years in the industry<br><br><br>Cels are definitely a lot harder and more time consuming than 3d animation. A lot of 3d animation I see in anime is really poorly done, maybe for a lack of budget or skill, I'm unsure.<br><br><br>I actually think they made money on the movie, quickly looking at wikipedia<br><br><br>For environments one person sets up the the light so it looks correct at every angle. Typically for characters they have a light right associated with it so you rotate the lights accordingly. The compositor then makes it blend (color correction, ect) and checks for continuity between shots.<br><br><br>I mean with the advent of animation programs such as toonboom 2d animation has gotten relatively cheap (and cheap looking depending on the show)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm talking about anime, not theoretical stuff. <br><br>No, you're only talking about hypothetical stuff. What something might cost if a lot of variables were suddenly removed, and trying to ignore how much it does cost in actual productions that have been made. <br><br>And I'll prove it.<br><br> nd all 3d I see in anime is lazy ugly shit like in Sidonia. <br><br>Sidonia's budget Vs Naruto, per episode, please.<br><br>Or One Piece, or Gundam, any action show of your choosing really, you decide.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>light rig* associated with the model</br>  <br>Cell animation is antiquated, 2D animation is done digitally now.<br>On the small scale, hand-drawn animation is infinitely easier than 3D, though on the larger scale, 3D can be done quicker even if it might be more expensive.</br></br>   10 minute <br> 3 years <br>So hes waiting for 3D animation look better and then make the movie 1 week after release?</br></br>  <br>How many triangles on average in a single frame? How long do the shots take to render? Do they go all out for photon lighting or rely on something else? What's the main 3D editing program you use?</br>  <br> No, you're only talking about hypothetical stuff. <br>I talk about what I see in anime.<br> And I'll prove it. <br> Sidonia's budget Vs <br>OK, I'll wait for you proving that. Also some info on difficulity from real nip animators. Until then I will shut up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably in development hell if it takes that long, or he's trying to learn the tools himself.</br>  <br> I actually think they made money on the movie, quickly looking at wikipedia <br><br>Misconception, Wiki only lists production budgets, not budgets including marketing.<br><br>Here's it with marketing<br><br> http://pro.boxoffice.com/statistic<wbr>s/movies/green-lantern-2011?q=green<wbr>%20lantern</wbr></wbr> <br><br> Worldwide Gross: $221,901,172  <br> Total Budget*: $275,000,000 <br><br>So, on the box-office front alone, they lost about 50 million, and countless more in those toy sales, since it only made Domestic $116,601,172, which reflects a VERY low kid turnout and that's where the vast majority of toy market sales come from.<br><br>Fun fact, the toys got into prototyping stage, but never out of it due to lack of orders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will /a/ cry for him like /v/ cries for Iwata when he dies?</br>  <br> Cels are definitely a lot harder and more time consuming than 3d animation. A lot of 3d animation I see in anime is really poorly done, maybe for a lack of budget or skill, I'm unsure. <br>Thanks a lot.<br><br><br>Talking about cells I meant 2D. Also they've shown cell animation in Shirobako, no? Why is it so blurry if it's digital then?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll have a party when this bitter old overrated hack finally dies.</br>  <br>We gonna be full dere then.</br>  <br><br>Because he's the saviour of anime and now he'll become the saviour of 3D CG.<br> Actually Etotama already saved it quite well. </br></br></br>  <br>Too bad every other part of it was mediocre.  Well, Uri-tan's VA was a nice surprise. </br>  Who cares about 2D or 3D? Anime's storytelling has gone to shit since 2009.<br><br>Anime is dead. Real anime fan will look for older anime to watch instead of seasonal shit.</br></br>  <br> triangles in a single frame <br>Millions, but everything get's subdivided. for modeling that stuff, It's typically "be smart with your models". No 5million poly rocks that you'll never see up close. Rule of Cool.<br><br> How long do the shots take to render? <br>Always too long. But this highly depends on the show and the renderer being used. At one studio you could render most passes locally except for like sets, at another you have to throw everything on the render farm. At my old studio you aimed for under 11 minutes for a single frame of an environment, but there wasnt much lighting.<br><br> Do they go all out for photon lighting or rely on something else? <br><br>For the lighting, depends on the art style of the show, budget, time constraints and ect. They don't typically go all out on the lighting, and even in some cases game engines do a better job. (which I think valve was briefly trying to push with Source Filmmaker)<br><br> What's the main 3D editing program you use? <br>Most studios either use Maya or 3dmax. Every large studio runs their own custom scripts for everything though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also they've shown cell animation in Shirobako, no? <br>Are you talking about the episode with the Chucky ED? That just had digital composite to feign the look of older animation processes.</br></br>   3 years of development for a 10 minute short <br> 3 years <br>Looks like Miyazaki is aiming for the Boyhood audience</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> Most studios either use Maya or 3dmax <br>I thought that Maya is more common. Hm.</br></br>  Miyazaki is still feeling frustrated that Osamu Tezuka died before Miyazaki could one-up him. That's why he moved on from manga to anime because he felt there was no way to surpass Tezuka's legend. And that's why he made a bunch of edgelord shows to one up Tezuka themes (Miyazaki failed) and now he's all bent out of shape because he still can't outdo a dead man.  <br>It will take him to learn about things then create something special. I hope.</br>  <br> And that's why he made a bunch of edgelord shows <br>Miyazaki? He always says how he don't want to force his pessimism on children. And he made lighthearted shows.</br></br>  <br>Maya is the industry standard for sure.</br>  <br>I can tell what you are trying to get across and believe that some day we'll have the technology. sidonia tried to do it but even that show at times went DEEP into uncanny valley. I just cant see 3d anime as an option because of how creepy it could look if a studio has a low budget. I mean just think of if evry anime looked like kingdom hearts 2 cutscenes</br>  <br>That sounds more like Tomino but he has his own style of getting his message across</br>  Hey. Dumping some supernatural shogi manga. It looks like those who died a heroic death are chosen for a shogi tournament, or something. 2013, ongoing.                                                                                    Where did it all go wrong?  The emotionless protagonist.  The shitty, vapid, worthless princess.  The stupid convoluted plot.  <br>IMO Inaho is the MC everyone wants in other series like Fate but now that kind of character exists everyone just hated on it.<br><br>but still that ending just got pulled out of the director's ass</br></br></br>  When Butcher left.   Inaho <br> Slaine <br> Vershime <br>Pick all of the above.</br></br></br>  <br>Inaho was great personality-wise. If the series had competent writers who could make him look capable without also turning him into a boring gary stu or making everybody else act like retards so he looks better in comparison then I think he could have been really great.</br>  When everyone except the bad guy survived being killed.  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was nothing convoluted about the plot, a fucking monkey could follow it from start to finish and proceed to fling his shit at the monitor.<br><br>G Reco had a convoluted plot. AZ's plot was just contrived and stupid.</br></br></br>  It was great how every time Inaho showed up to save the day that woahwoooahoowoah track played  MC didn't fuck Slaine on screen.  <br>Inaho was the worst thing about the show, it's like the writers sat down and said "how about we take Kira and remove the only thing that gives him any character (i.e. struggling to deal with being a soldier)". He was already bad in S1 when he was basically carrying the deucalion on his back but the shit really jumped the shark when he survives a bullet to the head, gets a magic computer eye, multiboxes the entire UFE army to defeat clone martian, and has the commander explicitly state that a fucking highschooler in a trainer suit is winning the war for earth.<br><br>And no, I'm not a slainefag either. Slaine was also horribly written, but for different reasons. AZ just shit the bed with pretty much everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>The princess was useless after episode 3.<br><br>Inaho's personality was never developed after episode 1.<br><br>Rayet was sidelines.<br><br>Marito was pointless, seriously pointless. <br><br>The writers were pussy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Somewhere around half way through the 2nd Season.  <br>Aldnoah.Zero = Gundam SEED<br>Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season = Gundam SEED Destiny<br>?</br></br></br>  <br>episode 2</br>  <br>I swear the stupidest shit could be happening on screen but I'd still somehow enjoy it if they were playing a hype track.</br>  There's not enough best boy porn  <br>I don't care what they say about Sawano, he's a great composer. I just wish more people would recognize Gundam Unicorn as his magnum opus.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3jy<wbr>KiqQy5u8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>L-i-t-e-r-a-l-l-y who?</br>  <br> best part about A/Z <br><br>implying it was not fact that they kept using Wikipedia physics buzz words to explain shit,and inaho some how figured it out in 10secs</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you think this is a great animu.</br>  <br>No, I seriously don't know who that is. Then again I never picked up S2.</br>  <br>You know, funny you should ask because had anyone asked me before AZ aired I would have laughed in their face for even insinuating that a mecha worse than GSD could be made. <br><br>Looking on it in hindsight now I honestly lean toward AZ being the worse of the two. Inaho and Slaine were both disasters of character writing, a bunch of the other characters didn't even need to exist, but the real straw that broke the camel's back would probably be Crutons junior. The fact that the writers had the gall to introduce an at the time unmentioned character 2 episodes before the finale for the EXPRESS purpose of trying to tie up their trainwreck of a plot was insulting.The only reason I would see myself rewatching AZ over Destiny if there was a gun to my head would be the length.</br></br></br>  <br>Poor character development, failure to properly explore major concepts and characters, Klondike's shoehorning, and a flimsy ending.</br>  <br>When Inaho dropped Slaine into the ocean. Seriously, why the fuck would he do that?</br>  <br>Learn to read filenames, you fucking   dummy  </br>  Everything.<br><br>The only thing it did right was shitting on slaine cocksuckers, which was very funny every time it happened.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you fuck off, i say this time and time again, Gundam Seed &amp; Destiny is criminally underrated. Don't compare that trash to any gundam at all.</br>  <br>this, even SEED destiny is better than A/Z</br>  <br>Anon, I would have just taken the bullet instead</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127957<wbr>481/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> What do you have to say to express the feeling of being cummed inside? </br>  <br>That works.

They're the easiest part of Japanese to learn and are very difficult to translate without it being awkward</br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br><br> difficult to translate <br>You mean impossible to translate. There is no English equivalent to honorifics. Culture and language have inherent ties, so you can't pull something out of one culture and expect it to naturally fit in another. "Bro" has a vastly different connotation from how translators try to use it in place of onii-chan or aniki, and nobody calls everyone "mister" in English like they do with "-san" in Japan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There may be no english semantemes equivalent to honourifics, but context-specific uses of words like "bro," "sir," "mister," etc. can mean pretty much the same thing depending on their inflection, syntagmatic associations, and accompanying body language.</br>  <br>that being said japanese body language is so different from normal people (american) body language that there is no point trying to translate honourifics.</br>  <br>So just leave the honorifics in.</br>  Why do they do the fucking finger thing to their mouths?  <br>come on guy everyone understands -chan and -kun and the feelings they convey. It adds a more human element to the dialogue.</br>  <br>It's a  monster secret </br>  Every time I see this show all I can think about is that Anon and his thread about her voice.  <br>I think you misread my post. I'm arguing for honorifics in subs. Trying to remove them or replace them with awkward English nontranslations is bad.</br>  <br>Because we have functional ears.</br>  <br>That's his point. Leave -chan and other honorifics in instead of trying to substitute some vague English approximate.</br>  Mikan's VA.  <br>What's the point of omitting them from the subs if you're already listening for them?</br>  <br>Are you serious? Subtitles are not captions. They translations. If it isn't a translation, it doesn't need to be included in the subtitles. This is equivocal to if a character speaks spanish or french, and the subs just kept them as spanish or french-- utterly pointless.</br>  <br><br>yeah my bad</br></br>  <br>Names aren't translated. So, should they be omitted or localised in your anime?</br>  <br>So you're saying that if a character uses Engrish in a sentence, that part should be left blank?</br>  <br> If it isn't a translation, it doesn't need to be included in the subtitles. <br>So all of Commie's memesubs then?</br></br>  <br> equivocal </br>  20 minutes.  <br>Their getting worse.</br>  <br> Their </br>  <br>Right on queue.</br>  <br><br>stop</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry, I didn't realize people were so adverse to phonetic puns.</br>  This episode is shit so far.  <br>The Alium parts are pretty cute so far.</br>  aizawa first appearance failed, it was shit  <br> Arguing at an individual word level <br>Translations are done with regards to ideas, not just words. If you were to translate a sentence in which a name is used, of course you aren't going to omit the name since the translation would no longer have a proper syntax.<br>Omission of honorifics does not disrupt syntax, however. <br>"Localization" is just as bad since it doesn't try to translate an idea, merely acting as a substitution.<br><br><br>Why not?

This manga is Nisekoi tier.</br>  Sorta disappointed with this episode. Not only is it out of order (Mikan appears before Aizawa), but they skipped one of the best parts of the chapter (ie, Dumpire and Kuromine playing old maid.) I'm a little worried that they're going to try and cram the plot without all the comedy.  <br><br><br><br>Well, I can't really disagree with those dubs, can I?<br><br>Does it turn into Nisekoi 2.0 later on? <br> Even if it does, I would still read it for dumpire-chan </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is nothing like nisekoi.

They even used "friendzone" in this episode.</br>  <br>go watch the op again</br>  this is so fucking bad nobody is even fansubbing this  So this is from another of his manga?  <br>At least you are being honest with your trip, tripfag-kun.</br>  <br>Oh, you meant Akane.

This should be illegal.  Is Densei the same age as Youko's parents?  Well then.  <br>She's pretty cute, but cuter in the manga. They skipped the Old Maid scene.</br>  <br>One of the guys looks like the MC of that so I guess you're right.</br>  <br>Why is she so stupid? This should be illegal.<br><br> Also, she looks way better and/or cuter in the manga. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm disappointing you feel this way, but your opinion doesn't mean shit.</br>  <br>I just want OP subs so I can sing along ;_;</br>  <br><br><br>There is even proto Oka</br></br></br>  Mikan's voice was better this week.   read chapters 1-80 in the span of a week <br> when I originally inspected the chapter counter it went as high as 84 <br> today I continued from 80, waiting for it to catch up at 84 <br> chapter 85 had just came out 4 hours earlier when I was sleeping </br></br></br>      <br> not binge reading manga <br><br>it's like you don't even read at all</br></br></br>   wagging dongle     Yeah Alien seems like a fucking bitch, What's wrong with her.   yfw the MC actually has balls in the manga to confess   <br> 80 chapters in a week <br>How?

There's not a drop of fat on it.</br>  <br> wide hips <br>Disgusting.<br><br>Flat chest and a flat ass is literally perfection.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They should've let Xebec make the adaptation, then everyone will turn chubby instantly.</br>  <br>Stop jerking off to men already.</br>  <br>Then you should probably stop jerking off to landwhales with cowtits.</br>  <br> What are you, Irish? <br><br>Nah tha' was uncalled for.</br></br></br>  her voice is actually pretty good  I feel the dumpire's voice is too high-pitched and not 'tomboyish' enough.  <br> dumpire <br> tomboy <br>Have we read the same manga?</br></br></br>  <br>I mean, the dumpire is obviously not a tomboy, but I feel her voice could have been deeper and maybe more rough. If I think of a really good example later, I'll post it.</br>  <br>fucking hell, I love the smiles this guy draws</br>  Have any of you /a/nons become a "Cool Beauty" yet?  <br>dude, wait for the principal, the girl with the pink hair and candy, to show up. I think that's when I really started enjoying dumpire's antics.<br><br>The show is currently moving at a snail's pace right now; i have no idea how far they'll actually get by the end of the season</br></br></br>  Wait, what?<br><br>I thought Orange doesn't find out until much later if ever?</br></br>  <br>i think she uses it as a bribe, but she never actually got to listen to it... I think.</br>    <br><br>That was a photoshop of Kuromine and Shiragami in front of a love hotel, I thought?</br></br>  <br>Orange never actually finds out about her being a vampire or Alium being an alien, but she's come very close. Also I would think that a reordering device wedged in a creampuff wouldn't work very well.</br>  <br>Always have been, anon.</br>  <br> that filename </br>  <br>ARISE, MY MORONS</br>    This ending is so fucking good, any news on when the full song is going to release?  <br>at least they are nailing orange</br>  <br>OP at the end of August and ED at the beginning of September I think.</br>    <br> ed <br> good <br>Are we watching the same chinese cartoon, anon?</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna nail orange, too.  ;_; </br>  it's me or the insert song was awkward ?  <br> still not as good as in the manga. The ost is also not that good </br>  <br><br>Everyone's voices are better in the manga. The only voice that is comparable is Asahi's.</br></br>  Aizawa is too cute in the anime.  <br>maybe YOU won't</br>  If you fuck External Unit Nagisa, would she feel it?  MINMI deserved much more than this  <br>go read the manga, filthy secondary, it has been addressed</br>  Can't wait for more tiny Aizawa shenanigans.  <br>Can't wait for Dumon to save the entire medium.</br>  <br>Gonna knock ya around a little pardner how's that sound</br>  <br>I enjoy the ED, it's a chill groove</br>    I want Dumpire to suck my blood.  <br>Is there a program to do these?</br>  <br><br>I don't get it. If you look at this guy's older works and the more recent chapters, they look similar, but the beginning of JWWW he has a completely different style.</br></br>  <br>He tried doing something different, but it didn't work out so he reverted to a style he was more comfortable with</br>  <br>Maybe he was trying another style but it didn't work. I guess that's why the art style changed so quickly.</br>  <br>What if she sucks your blood through your dick?</br>  <br/>  So in this harem the MC is not dense? And is that even possible, a harem MC that not dense?  <br>That's probably a good way to do it. I imagine a lot of blood runs through an erect penis.</br>  <br>Dumpire is the dense one. I guess that make her the MC.</br>  To be honest I'm liking the adaptation more than I thought I would, though the artstyle is less charming and more generic.  <br> downloading upscales </br>  Osaka-ben best ben.  I looked for a jitsu wa thread in the catalog to talk about last chapter, didn't know the anime was airing this season (thought it would air alongside heavy object for some reason).<br><br>I have mixed feelings.</br></br>  <br>Anon, could you please be a 12-year-old retard somewhere else?</br>  <br>It's known that CR's 1080p streams are higher quality than their 720p streams, even taking into account the upscaling. Go ahead, compare them yourself. Optimally, using CR's 1080p stream downscaled to 720p would be best.</br>  <br> kek <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br> not downloading upscales to piss people off </br>  <br>replace commie with fff</br>  <br>They can both be as bad or as good as each other. It depends who's working on the release.</br>  I want to make Yoko a single mom  Are we going to see more UFO spanking?  Oh man, I started the manga and thought it was a bit dull but once Akane showed up everything changed for the better. It's crazy.  Was there spanking in the beginning of the manga? I thought that was only in a chapter 110+  <br>Someone post the "the reason for all this" image</br>      <br>It was there  <br> but they changed it a little to look more like this</br></br>  <br>looks like you cant handle the Cool Beauty</br>   this wasn't a story about the MC and his bros <br>Why can't we have nice things?</br>  <br>jitsu wa 2: a story about cute, but dumb strippers you want to exploit</br>  So why did they get a 60 years old man to voice Sakurada?  <br>The story's also about his bros, surprisingly, just to a lesser extent. Or is it greater extent? Fucking Shima, man.</br>  <br>Because his secret is that he's an old salaryman trying to relive his high school days.</br>  <br><br>In an uncommon occurrence, MC isn't dense this time. Of course, a non-dense MC in a romcom means the romance would actually progress, so they make the main heroine dense instead.</br></br>  <br>I was hoping that he's actually a zombie.</br>  <br>Not even her denseness can stop progress </br>  <br>A zombie of adult society. After working day in and day out for 30 years, he mindlessly shuffles back to the place where he last felt something</br>  <br>I shudder to think of what Shima would do if he didn't have any friends.</br>  <br>Confirmed for shit taste. Go back to whacking it to action figures, pleb.</br>  Better than the first episode, couldn't shitpost this episode as i did with the first episode. Looking forward to the next episode.

The manga is great, they are doing a shit job with the overreaction faces.  <br>BD preorders after the first episode were dismal.  And by "dismal" I mean "twelve". Which is astoundingly shit.  Granted, it's really early in the season to be making those kinds of judgments, and this series starts off pretty slow to boot.<br><br>The reaction faces don't reach GOAT levels until Dumon's debut.</br></br></br>  <br>but you are as dumb as this show</br>  <br>ouch</br>  <br> Jitsu wa and Rokka no Yuusha doing worse than literally everything <br>Someone's asking for another fat man and little boy</br></br>  <br>Quickly?

It is nice to see an anime where the MC has a group of males friends.  <br>In a perfect world</br>  <br>I remember tat thread but it had maybe 15 replies when I went to sleep. Wish I saw how it turned out now.</br>  <br>It's a shame we'll never to the parts where they become somewhat relevant.</br>  Do you mangafags have the same predicament on deciding whether class rep or shiragami are best girls?    <br>The best girl is  Densei </br>  <br> Everyone showing and jiggling their dongles </br>  <br><br>Well at least her ass isn't bony like dumpire's.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> predicament <br>While I can respect Dumpire and her fans for good taste, Alium just trumps the other for me.</br></br>  <br>Why's that anon? I'm going to start reading the manga now so I can avoid posting stupid questions. But so far from the anime I see that they both have great qualities about themselves.</br>  <br>Best girl is actually Karen, the angel (or bakangel), who is also the class president.</br>  <br>Read it and form your own opinion about best girl<br>Some unspecified groups may be a bit more vocal than the rest about who they think deserves to win</br></br>  <br>Alium is basically the second MC of the series as it shifts to her perspective a lot and we get a good idea of what she's thinking and how she views things. She's also absolutely bro-tier and always gives it her all, even if she knows she's going to lose.</br>  <br>I just have a bad habit of taking fan opinions and keeping it in mind once I read a manga, bad in a sense that I could end up with a biased opinion once I'm done reading but oh well see you guys once I'm done</br>  With all the weird non beta male MCs this season I'm happy this one is around. It's not overly good but it is nice.  <br>The best girl is dumon. Second best is the slut.</br>  <br>Sasuga /a/</br>   wake up <br> see this <br>What do?</br></br>  <br>Spank her</br>  Why is nobody bothered that a girl has a screw in her head?  <br>Oshiri penpen</br>  <br>Threesome with her and her robot suit.</br>  <br>As far as they can tell, it's just a weird hair accessory. I'd say people would are more bothered that Dumon has horns to be concerned about Alium's screw.</br>  <br>Well, best girl is Alium and second best is Dumpire.<br><br>They're all pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't read the manga and I was wondering if it was a special hairbow before the reveal</br>  <br><br>They're just relieved that one of the main characters doesn't have their screw loose.</br></br>  <br>this is going to be a thing now isnt it</br>  I wasn't expecting much from this, but not all I can think about is the little alien girl being fucked  <br>SAVING ANIME</br>  <br>She's actually less cute in the manga at the point the anime is at. She gets cuter, but the anime made her cute from the very beginning.</br>  <br>Dumon can make it look like her horns come off though, so people just think it's a fashion accessory. I bet she put something in the town's water supply or something which is why everyone is fucking dumb.</br>  <br>More Alium is always good.</br>  <br>And she drank some, too, and that's why she's so fucking retarded herself?</br>  <br> I bet she put something in the town's water supply <br><br>I believe that something is called "harem logic"</br></br></br>  <br>Has she lost control of her life?</br>  <br> A plot twist that actually surprised me <br><br>Many people that read the manga thought she was going to be a Frankenstein instead of an alien due to the screw.</br></br></br>  <br>Do not sexualize the Alium. She is pure.</br>  <br>She probably wasn't that bright to begin with</br>  <br>That's exactly what I thought for the ten minutes between noticing the screw and the reveal</br>  <br>She's just the cutest.</br>  <br>She's the hero we need</br>  <br>She's absolute bro-tier</br>    <br><br><br>  Is this some kind of NTR manga? </br></br></br>  <br>It's not NTR if she was never together with Icecreamine to begin with.</br>  <br>  Yes <br><br>A better question is   NTR doujinshi when? </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>When will there be a What If she didn't turn him down?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this going to actually get an ending or is it going to turn into fantastical girl Nisekoi?  <br>Well, as far as the love stuff goes the MC and Main Girl are already officially together in the manga.</br>  <br>I doubt the anime will get there. Preorders are really shit too so it probably won't get another season.</br>  <br>Well of course the anime won't get there, won't even get to where Granddumber shows up.</br>  <br><br>Sounds like I should bother to read the manga</br></br>  <br>It's a pretty quick and easy read compared to others. You should be able to read through it in a couple of days</br>  <br>Considering Future Mikan said that there are many different timelines or something similar, then it wouldn't be too far-fetched.</br>  <br><br>It starts slow though, but picks up speed as the other characters are introduced.</br></br>  <br><br> NTR <br><br>IT KEEPS HAPPENING<br>  How pure is she, /a/? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Slutwolf gets cucked by Dumpire <br> Werewolf gets cucked by Eromine <br><br>We are dealing with some kind of theoretical Hyper NTR here</br></br></br></br>  <br>improved version</br>  <br>I'm saving it, but I don't approve of what it is.</br>  <br>Now all we need is for Slutwolf and Werewolf to cuck each other.</br>  <br><br>I'll probably pick it up after I finish the series I'm reading then</br></br>  <br>It is obviously a computer programming bug.

All of the members except for RinPana contribute to the group in some way. <br>Honoka - leader<br>Umi - lyrics<br>Kotori - costumes<br>Maki - composer<br>Nico - idol things<br>Eli - choreography and dance<br>Nozomi - group name, and bringing everyone together<br>Rin - ?<br>Pana - ?<br><br> all of their designs are generic technically compare the main 3 to any main idol trio <br>No it's not. When you're standing next to girls with blue, orange, yellow hair of course Hanayo would be bland in comparison. Even Kotori who has brown hair has a more striking color than Hanayo's. <br><br> bad how? <br>Because that's all what her character is. The fact that Maki and Rin still needs to push her because she's still too shy just shows how insubstantial her character development is. <br><br> aside from eli, umi and rin they... all have shitty squeaky voices. nico and kotori being the worst for that.  <br>Honk, Maki don't. Nico's voice has never been squeaky or high pitched. <br><br> &gt;last one is not even worth acknowledging <br>Could expand on this, but I'm already running out of spaces. <br><br> considering half the members also have the qualities listed. especially with that last point <br>Like what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see, you could make your own eli thread, but it will follow the same path as all ll threads:<br> post your fav raibu <br> people calling her a shit or agreeing with you <br> other people post their fave raibu <br> repeat <br> honk <br> pic of no honking (who came up with that? fuck you) <br><br>also, honk</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw lesbian bestiality <br>Damn Nico you went too far</br></br>  <br>Not the anon you're replying to, just playing devil's advocate here.<br><br> Umi - lyrics <br>She also did choreography prior to Eli and still does it sometimes<br><br> Nico - idol things <br>I guess you could argue Pana does the same thing? I mean I don't really see much of a difference in their idol fandom.<br><br> Nozomi - group name, and bringing everyone together <br>She brought together Eli and you could argue Nico. That's 3/9 including herself, which is about half of Honoka's count. Also after the group formed her job basically became groping duty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nico idol things <br>nigger what. that is fucking meaningless. along with honoka who does nothing as leader and nozomi who... just serves to grab boobs. <br> hair color means neat design <br>all of their hairstyles are just the same anime shit. hanayo included. that being said, hair is kind of irrelevant<br> bad character development <br>dont blame her for that. blame the shitty anime because honestly it hardly focuses on anyone aside from kotori, nico, maki and umi. the others are pushed to the side generally. and keep in mind, i said generally. girls like eli, honk and nozomi still have more prescence for no reason<br> nico voice not high pitched <br>my sides have deployed becaus you must not have fucking ears<br> members of rabu raibu are literally just stereotypes bro <br>honk- ditzy leader who is hopelessly goofy<br>kotori- air headed long hair girl<br>umi- generic submissive jap girl who is traditional<br>maki- brat rich girl<br>nico- skinny flat chest who wants to be center of attention<br>nozomi- le generic lesbian with big boobs<br>eli- foreign beauty senpai<br>rin- autistic cat girl<br>even rice is a stereotype of shy girl who eats lots. to say JUST HER is at fault of this is absurd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  my main problem from LL character discussions is when people say that some of them are groundbreaking characters. fucking please  <br>none of them are tho. you can enjoy the characters and even waifu them but god DAMN if you say theyre groundbreaking...</br>  Umi is love.  <br>umi a shit</br>  <br>Why would Umi a Nico?</br>  <br>Nobody in their right mind would try to argue they're groundbreaking characters, and they don't need to be. You just find one that fits your tastes to the T and watch her sing and dance in cute outfits.<br><br>It's not a very hard concept.</br></br></br>  <br>to be fair, ive only seen it happen in the jp community</br>      <br>Post more Umi.</br>  <br><br>see what the fuck i mean? <br><br>complete garbage</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is? Your post?</br>  <br>no, umi. nice try tho.</br>    <br>Stay mad Nicofag.</br>     only teenagers can pilot evas because that's who watches anime  <br> better give immature, uncoordinated, emotionally fragile children control of huge expensive murder robots </br>  It not about the robots anon, its about teaching you a life lesson  Holy shit, she is perfect.   I don´t actually watch the series and I am making shit up   <br>then please explain to me why only teenagers pilot the evas.</br>  <br><br>there's the anime reason (which I forgot, but I feel has something to do with being born in the right year or some shit) and the real life reason (OP's theory)<br><br>it is possible for the two to coexist in harmony</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pilots need to be born after the second impact to be compatible with the unit cores and the soul of the mother of the protagonist is trapped inside Unit- 01 so Baka Shinji is the only one who con truly pilot it.</br>  <br>The EVAs are their mamas except in case of Rei and Kaworu who are form of Lilith and Adam thus they are the mamas and papas</br>  <br> Pilots need to be born after the second impact to be compatible with the unit cores <br>of course they do. that's just good science. I'm not denying the story had a supposed reason for it, but you have to admit its a little contrived.</br></br>  damn that was awful<br><br>it never quite explained why the second mur mur was a villain but then again it was pretty poorly written in its entirety</br></br>   watching anything this season  <br><br><strong style="color: red;">(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)</strong></br></br>  <br>Yeah, this season's shit.<br><br>I'm just watching some old animu instead.</br></br></br>   watching anime ever   Shit, I haven't anything from this year   shitposting    watching        &lt;     Are you faglords ready for the next episode with tons of Papi's ass, Smith Legs and HORSE PUSSY? <br><br><br>also  there is any page for the live watch? </br></br></br>  <br>Snake /d/<br>Centaur /mlp/<br>Papi /out/<br>NTRfish /cgl/ maybe? or /y/<br>Suu probably /asp/ or /u/<br>Spider /d/ (bondage) and maybe /ic/ or /fa/ with the acting chapter<br>Lala /x/<br>Smith /int/<br>Darling /an/ probably</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly wouldn't, depending on a few things. I've been in a position of jealousy before, but I look back on it and realize how selfish, pathetic, and restrictive it was.<br><br>If the situation was a parallel to MonMusu, I'd actually be pretty happy having 5 god-tier blood brothers move into my home, as long as they checked their petty jealousies at the door and didn't treat it like a competition.</br></br></br>  <br>/x/phile here. This is great. Here for the sweet monster pussy.</br>  <br>The evil dead chapters were fucken awesome, I wish there were more chapters because it was a really good concept imo.</br>  <br>Do you have a folder of reaction image for Bird cafe? Could you upload it if you do, I love the manga and I can't wait an update.</br>  Did she just ditch her old place because Clarines seemed cool?<br><br>A</br></br>  <br>Also Shirayuki thread</br></blockquote>]
