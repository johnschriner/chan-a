Tens of thousands of women in one city raped and killed.

Japan denied everything not only while it was happening but even after film of the event was smuggled out.<br><br>There's a difference between one soldier forcing himself on a local and a conquering ground force systematizing rape on an entire population.<br><br>So like I said.

Only the crazy hardcore right wing Japanese netizens out right deny that Nanking massacre happened at all. Though needless to say, a lot of no-life jap otaku keyboard warriors deny it as well.

Nothing about Japan's terrain is in any way unique to it. Mountains exist elsewhere, as do plains, cities, and forests. The Japanese "optimized" their tank a bit for their terrain in light of the fact it isn't expected to go anywhere else (and thus doesn't need things like desert operations capability and huge intake filters), but that doesn't mean that other tanks wouldn't function just fine in Japan.<br><br>Modern MBTs are by design supposed to function just about everywhere. Just look at other island nations like Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, all of which operate "conventional" MBTs (Leopard 2 and PT-91) just fine. The Leopard 2, Abrams, Challenger series, etc. were all designed to operate globally either due to a desire to promote exports (Leopard 2) or because their operators needed the ability to deploy anywhere globally (Abrams, Challenger). Korea, incidentally, has a fuckton of mountains.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe magic and gods were inspired by people who passed through the gate and back?</br>  <br>Serfdom was used extensively in the HRE, which was essentially slavery; you were bound to the land, and forced to work for the local lord.<br><br>Churches had massive power back then, and were given a share of local land for their own use.<br><br>It was a bad time to be a peasant, that's for sure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I recommend you look up the rape of Nanking anon. <br><br>The peacetime Chinese government after world war 2 killed more chinese people than the wartime japanese ever did. Please also note the difference between war and peacetime for China. There's been a lot of anti-japan rhetoric by both China and fans of china ever since Japan refused to hand over some of its islands to China because they sit in an area where there could be deep sea oil. Some of the history rewriting has even occurred on wikipedia where many chinese rewrites had to be reversed.<br><br>China is quite unashamed with its various tactics as hypocrisy is not in its dictionary. For example, it tried to force its way onto the organization membership of nations that share arctic territory borders in order to secure fishing rights there. Currently, only countries which have shared arctic borders are members of the organization which meets to portion out fishing, navigation, and occupation rights. Obviously, China is no where near the arctic but that doesn't stop them from trying to force (or bribe) some of the organization's member nations into proposing China as a member.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I'm not agree with your reason, I agree with "re-bomb the fuck out of them" part. A-1 studio should be ground zero</br>  <br>In modern times, there is "wage slavery" but it is unlike older slavery models which tied people to land. The wage slavery model ties people into groups or classes of people. Of course, such people typically would live in certain lands that the upper classes don't live so in one abstract sense, land is still a factor.</br>  Elevens have become Westernized so much I'm not sure they could ever go back to the old Showa-era militaristic Imperialism.<br><br>It could happen, for sure, but it would take a long time for such sweeping changes to occur; you'd need at least a generation to reeducate the children.<br><br>Even with all their economic troubles and woes, the average person in Nippon still lives far, far better than they did pre-WW2. It would take some serious shit going down for things to change, and I cannot see that happening.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong century dude.</br>  <br>To add to that, type 10 uses a ceramic armor of some kind which JSDF claims more resilient than the standard Armour. I don't believe it till I see it but Japan did spend money researching on the topic.<br><br>Also type 10's design philosophy is different from K2. While K2 is designed to beat down enemy tanks head-on, type10 is designed to get them based on info from recon drones etc preferably before enemy get in the line of sight and either annihilate the targets or run away. <br><br>Name wise both K2 and type 10 are tanks but type 10 is more like a striker with better Armour and firepower that Abrams.</br></br></br></br></br>  But they can make awesome bros.  <br> Malaysia <br> island nation <br>It's a peninsula</br></br></br>  <br><br>All tanks with modern FCS are designed for battlefield networking. The Type 10 is not special in this regard, it just got a fancy video to promote the capability. In the US Army this capability is provided by cavalry scouts (the unsung heroes of armored warfare), helicopter reconnaissance, or via drone for units equipped with them. <br><br>Abrams has better armor than the Type 10, and almost certainly better penetration against likely threats. While people like to make a big deal about how the Leopard 2A6 has an L/55 gun and the Type 10 has an L/50 vs. the Abrams' L/44, the Abrams has much better ammunition as the US has invested huge sums in developing more advanced penetrators. This is why the US intentionally decided against using the L/55. Their ammunition is already plenty effective with the L/44 and the L/55 would require recalculating all of their ballistic tables and actually make the M829A3 too fast (its lower MV is designed to make it less likely to set off ERA on contact).<br><br>The Type 10 is impressive for what it is, namely an almost purely domestically-made tank focused on maintaining a low weight and high mobility. But it isn't an amazing wonder-tank, and at the end of the day, there are just no substitutes for mass. Those extra 10 tons of armor matter.<br><br>And Japan is no longer interested in building more tanks, their strategic doctrine is changing from expecting to repel a Soviet amphibious invasion of Hokkaido (which the Type 74 and 90 and to a lesser extent the Type 10 were designed around) to a focus on strategic mobility, using wheeled vehicles like the MCV rather than heavy tanks that are hard for Japan to deploy with its limited sealift capability. The threat is no longer a mass invasion but skirmishes in the disputed zones and islands against China. Tanks aren't so good for that role unless you're an Amerifat and have a whole fleet of ships designed to support them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what if she became Emroy's new apostle after rori.</br>  <br><br>inb4 Borneo.</br></br>  <br>That would actually fit her quite well.</br>  <br> COBRA COMMANDER </br>  <br>Are you joking?<br>Attach a short blade to each one of those ears and she will gouge your motherfucking eyes before you realize what is happening!</br></br>  <br>She'd be like 60 by then though.

For the purpose of avoiding attacking the same target and friendly fire, the platoon leader is given the capability to assign a target for each unit via BMS;automated target allocation is available. Target acquisition is enhanced by the shape based threat detection system which recognize MBTs, Armour vehicles, airborne threats, static targets and enemy personal. <br>I might have mistranslated some bits but hope you will forgive me for that.<br><br>Now I don't believe the auto aim is good, it would require human elements to prevent shooting a random target. The tank's FCS design is very experimental and would be dangerous for Peace keeping operation and such. For strictly defensive war-fair where you can plan well, however, it might work well. <br><br>As to Armour and penetration idk as I said and type 10 is probably not designed for anti-tank missions, but hard to imagine any new tank being totally useless there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh, an another thing you paranoid freak. <br><br>Japanese majority does NOT glorify imperial days.

Will they ever stop pretending that the narnians actually have a chance? Will the show get better?  <br>I still can't figure out who she was in the manga.</br>  <br><br>Kurokawa</br></br>  <br>I hardly remember her either. Does she ever even do anything?</br>  <br>She's the doc of the group.</br>  <br><br>Well she's the squad medic I think, and she's in charge of the infirmary when  the JSDF opens a station in Akusho </br></br>  <br> Will they ever stop pretending that the narnians actually have a chance? <br>That's part of the plot.<br>Basically the JSDF was hoping that the Empire would just sign the peace treat already so they could start prospecting for oil. But the Empire for the majority of the war simply refused to believe they are that outmatched. Much like Imperial Japan, the Empire believed for far too long that they stood a chance on at least getting decent peace terms. For half the story the Emperor genuinely believed that he could get a peace treaty without paying any gold or offer any land. That was insanity.<br><br>It doesn't help that the Japanese negotiators are soft-spoken and humble in behaviour. This gives the impression that the Japanese are weak and thus could be defeated. In comparison the Empire politicians screams and threatens.<br><br>The result is that the war lasted many times longer than it needed to be. And many died for no benefit to anyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pretending that the narnians actually have a chance? <br>They never did. Three japanese hobos and a pachinko machine devastated the whole army with only broken bottles and unwashed socks as weapons as soon as they went through the gate. The rest is just exploration and negotiations.</br></br>  <br>She's the first to notice something wrong with Tuka, and wants to help, though Itami keeps telling her how she'll have to take full responsibility, instead of just trying to help a little, and backing out as soon as things got hard.<br>Ultimately she backs off, but really she's pretty altruistic. She even considered taking some of the prostitutes back to Alnus, but realized that they would probably end up the same either way.</br></br>  <br> and a pachinko machine </br>  <br>Now I remember. She had that talk with the angel prostitute before the earthquake.</br>  <br> She even considered taking some of the prostitutes back to Alnus, but realized that they would probably end up the same either way. <br>Her issues is that the prostitutes don't really mind being prostitutes. It is just a job like any other. The particular monstergirl even told her that she enjoyed the fucking. Her trying to "rescure" that girl is just moral grandstanding. Sure, some of the girls might want other jobs if they could, but not all of them.</br></br>  <br> She tries to assassinate Lelei and fails <br>Wait what, for what purpose? Does it mean Pina's personality in WN is different compared to LN?</br></br>  <br> Wait what, for what purpose? Does it mean Pina's personality in WN is different compared to LN? <br>Pina in the original is an antagonist. And the only way she could ensure that the Gate closed forever and thus stopping JSDF destroy her nation, is making sure Lelei dies.</br></br>  <br><br>They're cutest when they wiggle to indicate emotional states, like a cat or something.</br></br>  Any anon here have the image of Idolmaster shitty design comparison? I need it for research.  kuri  <br>That's only true of modern prostitutes. <br>In the past, sex was cheap and exhausting and dangerous.</br></br>  <br>Maybe STDs don't exist in the GATE world.</br>  <br>HALP</br>  <br><br>I don't have it anon, sorry</br></br>  <br>Pretty much necessary if China decides to stir shit up</br>  <br>Who does she get shipped with?</br>  <br> In the past, sex was cheap and exhausting and dangerous. <br>For the monstergirl prostitute, being exhausted and live in danger is the norm in her world. Getting her moved to JSDF territory would make her work safer, sure, but she wouldn't stop working. One of the prostitutes complained that the JSDF never asked for their services and suggest they are impotent.<br><br>The point is that there are other people that needed saving. Actual slaves. The prostitutes might live a hard life but at least they are free-citizens.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Who does she get shipped with? <br>Due to wacky circumstances, Pina decided it would be best for everyone if she marry Itami. The issue being of course, that at that point she is not in any position to force her hand and Itami is already surrounded with women. Basically she knows having Itami be her husband is a good thing for her nation and she likes him too, but it is just too obvious to everyone that she would get the better part of the deal. Ironic that Itami might in fact be over-qualified and out of the Empress's league.</br></br>  <br> Otaku <br> over-qualified for an Empress </br></br>  <br> &gt;Otaku <br> &gt;over-qualified for an Empress <br>Lord Itami, partner with Rory the Reaper, slayer of dragons, and a couple of other honours that he earned in the side stories entirely by accident. Basically Itami stumbles into adventures against his will and come out of it with herculean accomplishments and myths. The guy is a walking legend despite not wanting to be famous. Things just turn out that way.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's another world anon, shit can get weird</br></br>  I'm sorry to be that guy, I stoped the manga when they were going back to Japan for the first time, anyone knows arround what chapter that was?

This comes in extremely handy for, among other things<br><br> Not wasting time on filler <br> Getting an idea if a series is good (especially compared to the Old, Deprecated ""3 episode"" rule). You can watch 9-12 episodes in the same time, or make a decision 3-6 episodes in and save more time. <br> Not wasting time on fetish segments which aren't your cup of tea <br> Superior to skipping because you still comprehend what's going on, but it doesn't waste your time, and if there's something interesting in there you still watch it. <br> You can easily go back and re-watch or slow down (or speed up) depending on if part of a show is not quite your style <br><br>And the main reason<br><br> You can watch far more anime than normalfag casuals do <br><br>Anime is usually a really simple medium with incredibly simple plots, so the story doesn't require a 1.00x speed watch through.

Who wouldn't that one shot</br></br>  <br>Its definitely in the top 10</br>  <br>go read it and find out?</br>  I will never understand cunts like you, OP.  <br> oda cocksucker <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Diamante killed Rebecca's father, who was also Kyros' wife. Therefore, we could have expected Rebecca and her father to unite their respective strengths in order to avenge the mother of their family. However, such thing didn't happen. Instead of making a 2 v 1 fight, who would have been legitimate considering that Diamante has a DF power whereas Kyros is weakened since he has only one leg and that Rebecca is already tired from fighting, Oda chose to make Kyros fight Diamante on his own. Why? For a propaganda reason, I dare say. Oda is from a country with a patriarchical and misogynist culture and he wants to spread it all over the world using his manga as a medium since there are ten of millions of people reading One Piece. It's shameful of him. He tries to make people think subconsciously that men should do the fight while women stay back, it's something that should be obvious to even the average reader. However, since many readers are young, they don't realize that and actually believe Oda is right without wondering whether he really is or not, and thus, Oda has achieved his misogynist objective. It's very sad considering that this is coming from the same author who fought racism with the FIshman Island arc.</br>  <br>No, not that. Just the way you start the thread with bait. For what purpose ? None. Simply for shitposting.</br>  <br>No, I meant that this fight had the worst writing ever. Not that I didn't know what happened with this fight. However I wouldn't even have mentionned it.<br><br><br>He had spiky balls, threw them in the air, they fell on Kyros, and he stood up as if he was perfectly fine.

If you don't agree with him, then speak, tell him your opinion. You don't have to be afraid. 4chan is a place where people disagree all the time and no one will criticize you just because you think a chapter had better writing then someone else believes. Why do you think OP used a question mark? It's because he wanted to discuss with you.<br><br><br>He was mistaken, let him regret it.<br>As for your opinion about this chapter, I also think it was quite forced. It wasn't horrible, though, but Oda could have made it much more natural.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you can fuck off and not buy his manga then though I doubt you do anyway.</br>  <br> Diamante killed Rebecca's father, who was also Kyros' wife. <br><br>almost hurt myself trying to process that for a second</br></br></br>  What are the lengths and girths of the male characters?  <br>When Law cuts Buggy inside his room, Buggy is cut and there is no damage.<br><br><br>You shouldn't tell people to "fuck off" just because you disagree.

I wrote too quickly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You think it's shit writing. That's your opinion. No need to bait people in to an argument. Obviously there are going to be 10s of people defending this, just like every other thread this discussion came up. "Calling out shit" as you say it serves no real purpose other create a 100 shitposts.</br>  <br>So if that's the case, what other variations of 2 and 9 are there to go through?</br>  <br> That's your opinion. <br> pls don't post your opinion of 4chinks k thx <br>Hang yourself you newfagging cancer</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know since Oda never made that official.<br>You shouldn't talk about this kind of pointless thing anyway. <br><br><br>He didn't bait. He gave his opinion and I agree with him to some extent. Don't call something bait just because you don't like it. It's very disrespectful of you. This Sabo chapter was a little forced. Tell me why you don't think so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand your anger, but you're going too far with these insults. I agree with you about Sabo. What do you think about Sabo's entire character?</br>  <br><br>Alright, I think your opinion is shit and you should kill yourself. There is literally no shit story writing in One Piece at all. Not even Rebecca.</br></br>  Everything Sabo story related is cheap and shit  <br>see? Write your shittaste from now on right away instead of being such a dramaqueen all the time you little bitch.</br>  what would have been a reasonable explanation for sabo to not show up for over 10 years?  <br>I didn't think this chapter was "shit". I think it was a bit forced. And no I won't kill myself just because you disagree with me. Even if we have different opinions, we have to respect each other.</br>  <br><br> we could have expected Rebecca and her father to unite  <br>You mean you expected<br><br> who would have been legitimate <br>Who's to say what's legitimate or not..if not the author himself right?<br><br> he wants to spread it all over the world using his manga <br>Now this is some assumption, he's a popular artist. What part of his art exactly isn't meant to be spread around the world? <br><br> It's shameful of him <br>..And he doesn't seem to be ashamed of it, are you?<br><br> He tries to make people think subconsciously <br>If you thought it subconsciously, that's fine. It's sad to try to find "hidden meanings" where there is none. You either understand what he's saying or you don't, you either agree with him or you don't, anything else is just making it more complicated... there's not much of a point in that, don't you think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Amnesia.</br>  <br>Even koala?</br>  <br>Having his own life and trusting ace just like luffy did back at thriller bark when he said that Ace has to go through his adventure with his own friends. After all luffy only rushed to ace AFTER losing his friends and therefore his primary goal for the time. If Sabo would have fought against a big shot who went against the revs during the happenings of the marineford arc, it would have shown that Sabo is an actual character and not just a plot devise/memeboy that Oda uses to have Ace in the manga after killing him off.</br>  <br>We can think up of some ideas together.<br><br><br> You mean you expected <br>No, we could have expected, but you didn't expect because you happen to share Oda's patriarchical mentality.<br><br> Who's to say what's legitimate or not..if not the author himself right? <br>I was talking about whether the fight would have been fair or not, since a lot of misogynists would have used this excuse to claim a 2 v 1 would have been unfair.<br><br> Now this is some assumption, he's a popular artist. What part of his art exactly isn't meant to be spread around the world?  <br>I didn't say it was wrong to want to spread his art. I said it's wrong to want to spread his patriarchical and misogynist culture. You are assuming something I never said. Assuming something wrong is very bad because it's what misogynists do all the time about women. You should change yourself because otherwise, your future will be very worrying. I can guess that many people will affected by you and the way you think. It's never too late to change.<br><br> ..And he doesn't seem to be ashamed of it, are you? <br>Unfortunately he isn't, this is the problem. Don't you get it? And I have nothing to be ashamed of since I am not the one drawing this manga. I am saying what's wrong with it. You are defending it subconsciously because you agree with the patriarchical it's spreading. Stop it right now.<br><br> If you thought it subconsciously, that's fine. It's sad to try to find "hidden meanings" where there is none. You either understand what he's saying or you don't, you either agree with him or you don't, anything else is just making it more complicated... there's not much of a point in that, don't you think? <br>You don't understand anything.

Those nigga have taste</br>  <br>Be careful, intolerant people will accuse you of replying to me.</br>  <br>At the least the tripfags fucked off, thanks allah</br>  <br>Man, again? Robin's, Vivi's, Kid's. Would wear them all.<br> as a former lolita I'm laughing at 11, those are really awful </br></br>  <br> After all luffy only rushed to ace AFTER losing his friends and therefore his primary goal for the time. <br>Even after losing his friends, his primary goal was to go back to his crewmates. <br><br>It wasn't until he found out Ace was going to be executed that he wanted to join the war. If he found out about the severity of the situation at Thriller Bark instead of at Amazon Lily, chances are he would've still wanted to go save Ace.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't have to separate your tastes according to genders as if men and women should always be separated. What's your favorite shoes overall?<br><br><br>No wonder considering how much you insulted them. You should be ashamed of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you happen to share Oda's patriarchical mentality. <br>ayy lmao<br><br> I was talking about whether the fight would have been fair or not <br>"Fair"? Really?....<br><br> You are assuming something I never said. <br>I asked you a question, buddy. And you didn't answer it.<br><br> You should change yourself  <br> It's never too late to change. <br>Fuck you.<br><br>  I am saying what's wrong with it. <br>  You are defending it subconsciously  <br>  you agree with the patriarchical it's spreading. <br>Seriously, I never once said that I agree with him, that's just you.. I don't even know what to say. You're demanding things, you're saying you know better... This isn't much of a discussion is it? But hey, I think I kind of don't care :) So all is good.<br><br>  I'll let you think on your own for some minutes. <br>*cringe*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really mind this at all. I mean, if within the space of 794 chapters an author uses amnesia as a plot device once, I think it's nothing worth getting upset over. It's a passable explanation.<br><br>That said, I would've been completely fine if it was never explained at all and just left as a minor plothole, because that's all it was in the first place. I would've preferred it if this chapter had continued on from the last one with a few more glimpses at other characters around the world rather than it be entirely focused on Sabo. That said, it's not shit writing. It's unnecessary exposition.</br></br></br>  <br> She was a victim of two groups and forgave both of them. She is a very great person. <br><br>perhaps im remembering shit wrong but when exactly was she a victim of fishmen? When Arlong kicked her?</br></br></br>  <br>Brook, Chopper and Robin.</br>  <br> Here are the Goroawase combinations: <br> 0 maru, ma, rei, re, nai, na, wa, o, zero, ze <br> 2 ni, ji, futatsu, futa, fu, bu, pu, nu, ne, tsu, zu, ju, nyu <br> 9 kyuu, gyuu, ku, gu, kokonotsu, kokono, koko, ko, go, ki, gi, kin, kun, gin, gun, nain </br></br></br></br>   news about Ace's execution reached even Imple Down <br> Iva figures out Luffy is Dragons son + Ace is Luffy's brother -&gt; Ace is Dragon's son too (can't blame for it) <br><br>Why the hell did he agree to break out from ID, if the news surely reached the Revolution Army.<br>In that case Dragon would make his own move to rescue "his son".<br>It was too risky for the breakout.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyros spared her more bloodshed you stupid fuck. The whole reason she was taught a bloodless fighting style was for this reason<br><br>How dumb do you have to be to miss the themes of a fucking kid's comic?</br></br></br>  <br>Lolita ?</br>  <br>That's the issue. I can't pick just one. If I could I wouldn't have picked three. <br><br>I'll say Brook as a tentative answer because they are pretty nice shoes.</br></br></br>  <br> ayy lmao <br>You are not even trying to answer properly. This is very lame of you.<br><br> "Fair"? Really?.... <br>I never said it was my opinion. Why don't you read things properly? I gave you a lot of time. Use it correctly instead of speedreading things and making wrong assumptions, it's not the first time you do it. You have to think.<br><br> Fuck you. <br>No.<br><br> Seriously, I never once said that I agree with him, that's just you.. I don't even know what to say. You're demanding things, you're saying you know better... This isn't much of a discussion is it? But hey, I think I kind of don't care :) So all is good. <br>You clearly agree with him, as a matter of fact, you try to deny my points without even trying to use proper arguments, which prove you are hopeless to prove me wrong even if you are unable to. All is good for me because it allows me to shows how wrong you are, but all is bad for you because you won't change. And I want you to change because I am worried for your future.<br><br> *cringe* <br>Cringing about yourself is a good thing but the next step is to think about why you were wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know Oda definitely has their dong sizes written down somewhere, right?</br>  IGNORE THE REBECCA FAG YOU IDIOTS  <br> Even after losing his friends, his primary goal was to go back to his crewmates. <br>nope that's the point: If he had his friends with him, he would have done the same as he did in Thriller bark. He would believe in Ace. He didn't because Kuma raped his crew beforehand. That connection is obvious, because in thriller bark lola outright told them that the vivre card suggests death, but luffy didn't go, because he wasn't raped by Kuma back then. Because he did belive in Ace's fate and FRIENDS. He literally found out about Ace's fate at thriller bark. He didn't belive anymore after the chaos on sabaody.<br><br><br> you <br>anon pls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kokonotsu <br><br>as in the fashion</br></br></br>  <br>I admit it might have been better if dragon just didnt let him go to marineford for the sake of revolutionaries not getting involved, although it would be hard to believe you could stop sabo. But just as well, he needed a reason that he didnt appear there so there it is</br>  <br>As a shoe salesman, I can say Sanji's and Crocodile's would sell most, followed by Franky's and Luffy's.<br>Nami's design is alright, but the colors kill it.<br>Perona's would sell plenty if they were for little girls.<br>I remember seeing some shoes like Robin's at the 70% off stand</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Army might have been miles away and I think Iva-chan was under the impression that Dragon was on his way to Marineford as well.</br>  <br>Tsumegeri Guards with the shitty hero water.</br>  <br>People on the ship talked about her at first as if she was a parasite, especially Arlong. Fortunately, they changed thanks to Fisher Tiger and she forgave them on the spot.<br><br><br>That's wrong. Rebecca wanted to save her father and should have been given this right. Why don't you understand that? If Rebecca was a man, she would have beaten Diamante with her father and Oda would have called that a marvelous family combination. But he didn't because Rebecca is a girl and he doesn't want to make girls fight because he thinks they should stay aside and let men do the fighting.<br><br><br>Okay.

As much as he loved Ace and Luffy, he was no longer aiming to become a pirate. He no longer had the same goal as them. And besides, when he left to be a pirate and was gunned down, he had already decided to leave them for an undetermined amount of time. After Ace and Shanks left Luffy they didn't do anything to contact him either for years. As for being a revolutionary, it's not like they can just send regular-ass mail and hope it's not traced, and how would you send mail to Ace and Luffy anyway? They lived out in a fucking jungle, no address or anything.</br>  <br><br> You are not even trying to answer properly. This is very lame of you. <br>But there is nothing to answer.

(Sabo broke it for reason) <br>Plus a promise about they never bother eachother's route if it isn't neccessary. And Sabo shouldn't know about Luffy and Ace thought he's dead.<br><br> not being at Marineford <br>He was on a secret mission without a Den Den Mushi (or if with, he doesn't even bother to answer the call) and the news about Ace was captured and his execution didn't reach him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She was a victim of two groups and forgave both of them. She is a very great person. <br>The point is that she wasn't the victim of any "group". "Group" in this context is racist.

It's quite different you know... Trying to deny it would be saying <br>You didn't. I already explained everything. However you keep trying to deny my posts without making a point because you know that I am right and are frustrated at this thought. It's not right. If you disagree, then you must think and say what you disagree about. Then we'll discuss. It's alright for you to be wrong, I won't blame you, but try to help you.<br><br> this stuff ^. This is denying someone. <br>I never said what was wrong was to deny someone. It's to deny someone without giving proper arguments. You seem to have bad reading comprehension skills because you keep twisting my words. I will assume you aren't english and don't master the english language well enough yet. Try to think a little so that you won't make any bad interpretation anymore. Take your time.<br><br> Well mate.. :^) That's a waste of time. I don't care the slightest for you, you shouldn't care for me either. Don't lie to yourself pretending that you care, because you don't ;) <br>Even if you don't care about me, I care for you. Don't be pessimistic about yourself, there are people who care for you in this world even if you don't think so. Are you often alone? Well, you have me now.

I'm fighting for your future. If you don't understand that, you will never change. When IRL shut-ins are told to change, they try to get away and to be alone, so it's not surprising that you do the same online. You are afraid of changing, so you run away from reality. It's too bad if you don't come back but your life won't become better like this. Instead of staying close-minded, you must try to think properly in order to become a mature adult respectful of other people. Believe me, as I am probably older than you.</br>  <br>Yeah. It's all kids arguing against kids. Fucking stupid. 4chan is a goddamn shithole because of this immature underage faggotry. Makes me mad.</br>  Let's just post a link to the Rebecca porn and stop replying.  <br>I don't care about not being liked. Anyway, let's talk about One Piece. What do you think about this chapter. Don't you think it was kind of forced, like I and another person said earlier?<br><br><br>Hello, it's been a long time.

At Thriller Bark, Luffy assumed that Ace was probably in some kind of fight and he believed he'd be fine eventually, because A: Pirates fight and B: Ace was a really fucking strong pirate. Whether he had his crew or not, had little to do with his decision to go to Marineford, it was the fact that he found out Ace got captured with no chance to escape that made Luffy want to go. Luffy also flat out said that he wouldn't be able to be of much good if Ace was in trouble and that Ace hated getting looked down upon. <br><br>He felt the same when he found out about everything, but still went because the threat to Ace's life was that much greater that he didn't care about all of that anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hello. I am trolling you right now with this very post.<br><br>Can you handle the crushing mysoginism? How are you dealing with the absolutely disrespectful display of male, white imperialism conveyed within my words? Does it annoy you? Does it make you angry? Good. I have dedicated all of my existence to the Patriarchy. Within this very post, you catch a glimpse of your worst enemy. I was trained from birth in secret compounds, where we learned how to harness and use our powers as heterosexual cis caucasian men in the oppression of women, homosexuals, trans, black, and any person unlike us you can think of. Only a few chosen ones, who show the highest concentrated Patriarchal power (PP) are let into those compounds. My sole goal in life is to carry out the will of my masters, and I have learned to take enjoyment from it, as have all the others who grew with me. We were nurtured in prejudice, and released back into society, where we now hunt for minorities to oppress, with normal, everyday lives serving as a disguise. And we are not few. We are many. One of the advantages of working for those in power is the ease to blend into any everyday societal role. Anyone around you could be one of us. Your father. Your brother. Your neighbor. The shop owners, the gardeners, the cab drivers, the cops, every man around you could be one of us, and you'll never know, for we are taught to keep our training a secret and take it to the grave. But still we work, in the shadows, to maintain the power of the Patriarchs. You are but one of many victims, one I have chosen to illuminate, to forcefully shove my thick hard redpill into, but worry not, I am high enough in rank within this organization that I can do it with no repercussions (I am Order of the High Fedora, by the way, with a PP of over 10000). I just thought it amusing. And no one will believe you if you tell them, anyway.<br><br>I hope you enjoy your uphill, meaningless battle. We have already won it long ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>excellent taste</br></br></br></br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>Since it's a copy/pasta then there's no point in me replying to this. I've already read many things like this, it's not very interesting even as trolling. Sorry.</br>  <br> Luffy also flat out said that he wouldn't be able to be of much good if Ace was in trouble and that Ace hated getting looked down upon. <br>That's the point, he ignored his principles, because he tasted comlete defeat by Kuma right beforehand. maling him turn 180 and helping ace</br></br>  <br>Buggy? Croc? Daz? Is that really you?<br>also top ship</br></br>  <br> Law x Kyros could be nice. <br><br>i'm...</br></br></br>  <br>The lowest of the low was Zoro refusing to fight Monet because she's a woman. Like what the fick, Zoro is a badass that doesn't give a shit about anything, he cracked a bitch's skull in Weasky Peak and now he can't hit women?<br><br>That shits all his promise to Kuina, since he basically admitted that women can't fight men and that her despair was justified.<br><br>I'm not even a feminist or anything but Oda's misogyny is embarrassing even be Shonen standards. At least Kubo and Kishimoto don't spare women from brutal fights and treat them like little flowers, Nnoitra was pretty much humiliated bu Nel for being a misogynist prick, but no, Oda has to make sure that women know their place and don't even get involved with male affairs.<br><br>The text of the Genderswapped Supernovas are just sickening. Are you seriously fucking telling me that just because them changed sex all their ambitions and hopes vanished in the void?

He helped ace, because he, after losing his friends like that, realised what ace is probably going through as he was in that situation since thriller bark as the news confirmed. without his people ace was all alone - just like luffy. If luffy would have read the news during thriller bark, he would have believed in ace an wouln't try savin him. thriller bark and impol down luffy are not the same.</br></br>  <br>conqueror's Haki has been there since Chapter 1, Shanks used it on the sea king</br>  No chapter this week?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KQJ<wbr>y0Q-td10</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>MMD Time</br></br>  <br>It's Luffy, holy sheet.</br>  <br>No.  You should read the entire chapter from now on because it usually tells us on the last page when we're not getting a chapter for the next week. </br>  <br>I love his crazy eyes</br>  <br>What am I supposed to look at here?</br>  <br>i think even sanji wouldn't bother to fight that 'women'</br>  <br>By the way, you are probably , got frustrated about not being able to answer since you implied you wouldn't anymore, and had no other choice to use a copy/pasta to reply without revealing your identity. People usually never suddenly use a random copy pasta, especially a very bad one like this, so it makes me think that you are a young teenager who discovered 4chan recently and is convinced that bad copy pastas like this are effective. It would explain why you behaved in a way as stubborn as a young shut-in refusing to listen to his parents. I understand the way you think because I studied psychology. You should try to grow up before trying to act like an adult because it's bad for your self-development.<br><br><br>I understand your point. However, Rebecca also wanted to protect her father, who was deeply injured. Kyros couldn't even stand, but Oda made him stand because he wanted to show how men and fathers are stronger than women according to his patriarchical ideology.<br><br><br>Oda takes a break from time to time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At least Kubo and Kishimoto don't spare women from brutal fights and treat them like little flowers <br>fuck off. I'd rather have women be spared from brutal fights (though there are clearly counter examples but whatever. since people like you ignore counter examples anyway) and be able to pursue their own dreams and ambitions than have their whole life and actions revolve around male characters. <br><br>If Oda doesn't want to fuck up his female characters that's on him, but at least his female characters can hold and act on their own. They're not tied down by some male love interest and their dreams/goals have nothing to do with one too. I'd take Nami and Robin any day over shits like Sakura, Hinata, or Orihime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a disgusting page.

On the other side there's the fanservice, a lot of shitty perverted characters and shit like the Monet thing. <br>I don't understand Oda on this, never have.</br></br>  <br><br>here's the first one for comparison</br></br>  <br>Just to joke with his readers. But it's still pointless.<br><br><br>His female characters are very restrained.<br>Sakura is a good character. She is a strong woman who can fight for herself and cares for her daughter.

Because his gear and pencil stache and look is saying "hey look at me, I'm a bad boy," but his words and actions are those of a goddamn pussy. He may as well be an errand boy for a REAL man, like Souma. Hell knows why he's still here with that pussy-ass attitude, he was probably as big of a wimp BEFORE he came to Tootsuki and got wrung out. Souma should have challenged him to a Shokugeki and blown him out the window when he was burning through those second-years after Stagiare. A fucking useless character, who KNOWS he's useless, and stuck with the second most useless character on the show (Meat) who exists to blush and act like the whore she is.

It's worth it, while the anime has been a really good adaptation so far the manga is still superior. As for the gap, probably enough material for another cour after S2 ends, maybe 2 depending on where they end it exactly. Plus the manga has much better visual design than the anime</br></br>  The other Isobe Isobee Monogatari crossover is done and over at http://imgur.com/a/rY6Rd.

And I personally like her bitchy look, although she also looks cute when she goes soft</br></br>  At any point in the manga is Erina not a bitch to Soma? Even from an animeonlyfag point of view the author is clearly going to to get them together but she has zero chemistry with Soma, Megumi makes more sense.  <br> better chemistry with Megumi. <br><br>No, it's boring.</br></br></br>  <br>She is a lot more dere after the autumn election</br>  I would read the manga but I don't want to fall into the trap of waiting week by week just for a sliver of a plot progression. I already did it with  SnK  and  One Piece  and now I deeply regret it; the chapter by chapter wait is too painful. I might have considered doing it with Shokugeki no Souma if the manga was close at all to finishing, but from what I hear it's only about half way or something.  <br><br>i wouldnt even call it halfway, they're still in the first year<br><br>and it's actually getting really popular so the authors might drag it a bit longer</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded</br>  <br>I was under the imppression that erina was joichiro's daughter who was adopted because of her god ter taste</br>  <br>Why doesn't SnS have a cute mascot like Happy/Kon/Chopper?</br>  <br>erina is their cute mascot</br>  <br>Wouldn't watching the anime be a week to week wait too unless you're one of those marathon guys.</br>  <br> erina <br> cute </br></br>  <br>I only like marathoning manga. With anime, I can watch weekly or marathon it.</br>  <br>mascots are cancer</br>  <br> and it's actually getting really popular so the authors might drag it a bit longer <br>God I hope not. I hate it when they drag it out for the sales, and/or never end it.</br></br>  <br>Meat is best for Souma but we get no character development from her</br>  what the fuck is the point of karaage arc  <br>To use useless meat before it spoils.</br>  <br><br>Leonora &gt; all</br></br>  <br>Bit of a breather between hotel arc and long as fuck tournament arc.</br>  <br>It's simple fun and we meet another elite 10, starting the nigga events later on.</br>  Doesn't Erina's character CD get released today?

Look at this form  <br>If gigganigga was a bishounen he would have been one of fujos favorites.</br>  <br> when all the anime and manga characters worth dressing up as are white <br> implying <br>What about cosplays for all-Japanese casts, dingus? There's literally no visual difference between Asians and whites in anime anyway besides hair/eye color.<br><br><br>Fucking jeez.

Mild seafood allergy with a severe shellfish allergy. </br>  So back in the day, Gin was #1 and Joichiro was #2. Joichiro's cooking present-day makes Buddhist monks forsake their vows; has Gin kept up with his cooking or has he been behind the director's desk too long and lost his edge?  <br>Dojima doesn't even have his own restaurant, he works for other people instead of working for himself.</br>  <br>That sucks. My only allergy is alcohol, but it doesn't bother me at all.</br>    <br>I want to see more of this Takumi.</br>  <br>I am only allergic to kiwi fruit, and only in raw form (I can eat it in yogurt just fine). <br><br> <br> Mad Takumi is best Takumi </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's kind of depressing, his level of talent and ability just being dropped like that.

Remember they even introduced his sous chef.</br>  <br>That shokugeki was kind of a letdown. It makes sense because it still gives him a reason to want to beat Souma, but I was really hoping he'd blow the fuck out of knifenigger</br>  <br> Working as the head chef for Tootsuki resort <br> Bad </br></br>  <br>NAKIRI resort, not his restaurant, he just works for the Nakiris.<br>Shinomiya called him on that when he was being a retard.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, people complain about the Souma x Alice but that one was really the biggest asspull of the tournament.</br>  <br><br>I know what you mean, but it would have been silly with the hype that giganigga had gotten at that point, and the flags that Takumi had raised. I assume that the author didn't want to end their rivalry prematurely either, as it would inevitably had ended with Souma slapping some Italian ass.</br></br>  SHOKUGEKI NO  DSP !<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CKc<wbr>9cd1ffRI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Which is funny because Shinomiya himself had stopped improving.<br><br>I think people get pretty lost when they graduate because they already think they are so good and get offers to work everywhere and they end up losing their edge.<br><br>Jun is the only exception I can think of, even Shinomiya was lost before meeting Souma.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like I said, it makes sense to write it how the author did, but imagine the hype if Takumi pulled out that smooth Italian cooking and wrecked the guy. Easily best boy</br>  <br>so close to that get too.</br>  <br> 15 mins <br>I didn't realise it was already Friday</br></br>  <br>Why shonen rivalry only works when rival is stronger than MC? Author made Kurokiba and Curry so they would be above Souma. Why can't MC and his rival start at the same level and grow simultaneously, sometimes let MC win, sometimes let rival win. But no, rivalry only last as long as rival is stronger - and when he is finally beaten, he either becomes friendly/joke character or eternal loser trying to catch up with MC (see Vegeta).</br>  <br> 15 minutes to cook an omelette <br><br>Sasuga DSP-san.</br></br></br>  <br> no milk when making an omelette <br>WHAT ARE YOU DOING DSP</br></br>  <br>He does use milk.

And since it's the Nakiris, you know that if he weren't living up to being the best, they'd have replaced him.</br>  <br>Oh, he didn't have it out at the start so I assumed he didn't bother</br>  <br>But it's evident he can't compete with Saiba as of now, there's a huge difference between being employed and running a business.</br>  <br>Read the manga if you haven't already</br>  <br>Read the manga. If you liked the anime I'm sure you will enjoy the manga.</br>  So what episode should Hayama be making his first appearance in? I can't wait to hear dat Suwabe.  <br>Probably at the end of the next episode.</br>  <br> best anime ever <br> that Deviantart-tier pic <br> Megumi <br>I do not approve.<br><br>And read the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The salt from animeonlyfags when he wins will be gold</br>  <br>But Gin is also the head of the entire Tourism division.

It means he has to spend more time signing papers and less time cooking.</br>  <br>Truly shit taste. Erina is, and always will be, best girl. Alice looks like an alien</br>  <br>I can actually agree with that, but it's the exact opposite point that the anon I was responding to was making.</br>  <br> Alice looks like an alien <br>She looks alright in the manga</br></br>  Better res when?  <br>Maybe if you're into "muh Princess" spoiled rich kids which is worst girl usually.<br><br>Taking others things isn't best girl material.</br></br></br>  <br>Anything beats the deredere doormat with self-esteem issues.</br>  <br>you called?</br>  <br><br> Megumi is the self-insert character </br></br>  <br>For the girls who read this, most certainly<br> plain <br> personality issues <br> needs to be saved <br> is actually quite talented if she tries <br> everyone loves and supports her <br> even people she's just met <br>She's basically an otome MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not liking alice </br>   not having Hisako as your best girl. <br><br>Fucking plebs.</br></br>  <br><br>She's the character I relate the most to, and I'm not even a girl.</br></br>  <br><br>Megumi &gt; Alice &gt; Erina</br></br>  <br>Have you noticed she follows Souma around like.

I see.</br></br></br>  <br> How wide is the gap between the anime and the manga? <br><br>As of this week, the manga will have 127 chapters. Episode 15 ended at Chapter 41 of the manga, so we're just under a 1/3 of the way through. <br><br>Give or take that they re-arranged some small details from the manga and added them earlier in the anime, it's been pretty faithful. They have however, skipped an arc which is around 4-5 chapters (35-39)<br><br> Should I go ahead and catch up or just finish the anime and start reading afterwards? <br><br>Go read Chapters 35-39 in the manga as it's the arc they skipped. It's not really important but it does introduce one of the Elite Ten towards the end, so it's worthwhile. Apart from that, the anime will most likely end on a cliffhanger before the preliminary's even finish, so wait until then to read the rest of the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whoops, it's 128 as of this week, not 127.<br><br>My bad.</br></br></br>  <br> Boring = a character that supports MC no matter what but will disagree with him at times. <br> Not Boring = a character who doesn't agree with MC at all and tries their best to make them fail/take them out. <br><br>All subjective my friend.</br></br></br></br>  <br> putting milk in an omelette <br>lol</br></br>  <br>Megumi, Kurase, and that little journalist kid all fits in that category of boring.</br>  <br>I want Hisako with glasses back. That was the best.</br>  <br><br><br><br>The almost is about how she took a nosedive and became some kind of pseudo-tsundere and general doofus during the first days of the stagiaire. In terms of her character overall I would probably rank her above Alice and Erina, but I would like to see more of her now that she has gotten her confidence back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>this guy knoes</br>  <br>She would cut your dick and make a burger with it</br>  <br> I would let her </br>  <br>megumi is boring because she is just the generic supportive moeblob love interest</br>   /ai/ - Idle Activities   <br>Is one of the reasons anon, besides being badly handled and the plot not advancing with their constant ties.<br><br> go fuck yourself <br>That is not very nice.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not wanting to fuck yourself <br>You need to raise that self-esteem anon.</br></br>  <br>Mikan a glutton.</br>  <br>Indeed, I really need it ;_;</br>  <br>Im rewatching it now and its honestly not as bad as I remember after the first few episodes, although I havent gotten to the Aikatsu8 bullshit yet.

I think both are fun, but not AOTS material.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I guess you didn't like SYD either. <br>This post is giving me deja vu.  Different anon, still think it's shit. </br></br>  <br>Except SYD was a lot less forced with its humor and sex jokes then this crap.</br>  <br>if you enjoy modern womyn comedy sure.<br> sex bad puns <br> oh penis penis benis <br><br> but is "fun" <br>my favorite defense straw.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wakaba needs to be at number 2 and its perfect.</br>  <br>It really wasn't. They're about the same.</br>  <br>Dropped 5 and didn't even start another 2 from that list.</br>  <br> modern womyn comedy <br> first episode starts with a woman trying to frame a guy for groping her on the bus for the money <br>If anything, this is /pol/: The Anime.</br></br></br>  <br> They're about the same. <br>They really aren't.</br></br>  <br><br><br>SYD was a lot more hilarious.<br>Shimoneta is meh. At most it got a chuckle out of me.</br></br></br></br>  Binkan (yui ogura) episode when  <br>7-10 replaced with Prison School, Monster musume, Overlord, Fate Illya and you have proved that you understand /a/</br>  <br>That was one scene, go to the GATE threads if you want /pol/.</br>  <br> wanting /pol/ <br>why would anyone want that</br></br>  <br> a world where perverts are arrested and taken away <br> she's allowed to roam free <br><br>She's so obviously a creep and yet no one does anything. Even the terrorist wants nothing to do with her. How the fuck does she get away with it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>  /pol/ don't want to shitpost on /a/ </br>  <br>she's an assburger, she wants to know about sex and sex accessories not for lewdness, but for science</br>  <br>Are you saying there is something wrong with /pol/?</br>  <br><br>I wouldn't say best of the season however I would say that this and monster musume are the most unique and creative so far. I think I like shimoneta the most though because it reminds me of something old Gainax would make.</br></br>  <br>everything is wrong with /pol/, it is a cesspool.</br>  <br>You must be joking. SYD was intelligent with its use of crude humor. Shimoneta grew stale by the end of its first episode because all it does is repeat PENIS VAGINA DIARRHEA.</br>  <br>I was about to post exactly "Everything is wrong with /pol/." and then I scrolled down to see .</br>  <br>I know Shimoneta is shit, but Non Non Biyori is yet another show about cute girls doing fucking nothing for 13 episodes. The fact that /a/ thinks this stuff is AOTS material is pretty sad.</br>   implying feminists would like the idea one kiss makes you turn into a raging nympho   <br><br>Explain yourselves before you post such blatant accusations.</br></br>  <br>seeing as nobody ever posts the fucking title of this fucking anime then no, I can't say if it's AOTS</br>  <br> feminists </br>  <br>I'm convinced the problem with this show is in the translation. It seems to rely on Japanese wordplay and it just doesn't transfer over to English.<br>That or she's generally an idiot who just shouts dirty words whenever and thinks its funny because of the nationwide repression.</br></br>  <br>I know right? Nobody ever watches MANime like Gangsta.</br>  <br>Prison School isn't an anime so good job</br>  <br>It's Shimoneta.<br>Its been said multiple times in this thread</br></br>  <br>This, pretty much.<br><br>I hope you faggots don't report this again because this copypasta is actually pretty good even if it was intended as bait at the same time:<br><br> This show reeks of your typical "liberal" idiocy of "either you have to be an ultra-conservative prude who keeps children laughably sexually oblivious because you think sexuality is dirty, or you have your culture revel in all kinds of perversions and pornography which also do jack shit to challenge the status quo of seeing sexuality as something dirty." <br><br> The anime's title claims that it plays in a world where dirty jokes don't exist. Clearly they do exist, because people register them, except for ignorant children (just like in our current real-life culture, except the age of ignorance is raised). <br><br> A world where dirty jokes actually don't exist would be a world where people don't associate sexuality with perversion in first place. The whole concept of a dirty joke is based on the premise that sexuality is dirty, and hence a joke referencing sexuality is a dirty joke. This is the very same backwards, conservative mindset against sexuality, with the sole difference that now it's not banned but paradoxically celebrated despite still being exercised in perverted (dirty) ways. <br><br> Ask yourself why real-life women and especially young women and girls tend to be less inclined to partake in sexual discussions and dirty jokes. It's because in our current conception of dirty sexuality, the dirtiness serves as a way of demeaning the female side in sexuality. Either a formerly "pure" woman is dirtied, or an already dirty slut's dirtiness is enjoyed. In either case the female side's dignity is sold off for the male side's pleasure. <br><br> Which is why it's also bullshit that the girls in this show would naturally/instinctively find the pictures they're shown to be attractive. <br><br>With "pictures they're shown" I think it means the ones in ep1. They were showing girls in stereotypically submissive poses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its leaking to other boards, that's why, and with that let me tell you that Prison School  manga  is the best this season.</br>  <br> Prison School isn't an anime <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Maybe he means it's a slideshow or something. I dropped it 20 seconds in but it seemed incredibly cheap.</br>  <br><br>it's a manga</br></br>  <br><br>nigger it looks like it was produced by powerpoint</br></br>  <br>/pol/'s ideas and most people who post there are genuinely utterly completely thoroughly fucking retarded. You should believe absolutely nothing they spew. In fact its polar opposite is usually going to be fairly well-supported truth.</br>  <br>It gets better</br>  <br>well while i cant argue with that, it also got an anime adaptation.</br>  <br>I know you are trying to be sarcastic but Gangsta is legit.</br>  <br>I really don't like  sexual objectification  so that first scene with the dominatrix already made me cringe so fucking hard I dropped it like a chimp holding a ten megaton barbell in a super-gravity field.  I'm not good at expressing this level of disgust. </br>  <br>no it doesn't, if it does nobody on /a/ talks about it</br>  <br>Just go back to tumblr or whatever place you came from.</br>  <br>It's alright. I'm sure your fellow SJWs on tumblr understand.</br>  <br>Excellent meme.</br>  <br>i'm being serious here<br>last time i went to the thread it was only manga discussion and images</br></br>  <br>Because sourcefags don't allow people to talk about the anime. But unless you are legitimately retarded you should still know it exists.</br>  <br><br> hurr durr tumblr SJW <br>Every single fucking time since Gaymergate.<br>I don't remember what they called me before that. Maybe it was possible to have at least some anti-sexualization discussion back then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think anime as a whole is the wrong medium for you.</br>  <br>Probably the same thing we're calling you now, Tumblr has been a place of angry landwhales way before that little event. Funnily enough, they'll still objectify guys they like so I never got how they thought they were any better.</br>  <br> watching anime <br> being on /a/ <br> going into a Shimoneta thread <br><br>You make some very strange decisions for someone who is "pro-anti-sexualization".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what is Miyazaki <br> what is every single anime that actually has high quality <br><br><br> we <br>You're not fitting in, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shimoneta is better, you are just trying too hard.</br>  So do we actually like Shimoneta or are we just watching it ironically?  <br>yeah</br>  <br> watching it ironically <br><br>I found ep1 fairly entertaining but didn't feel like continuing because  made me look down on the show and the subsequent episodes are usually bound to be worse than the first.<br><br> Why am I in this thread again? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asking /a/ if 'we' like something <br>/a/ very rarely has an actual consensus on things like this. <br>Watch whatever the fuck you want, whether its ironically or because you actually like it.</br></br></br>  <br>Shimoneta is amazing, it's our AOTS in this sorry season <br>Non non doesn't counts</br></br>  <br>you aren't alone in this thinking. Sexual Objectification is somewhat of a serious problem, but I wouldn't say its quite as big in anime or games simply because the medium itself is so detached from reality. If anything sex in say, advertising is another story. But thats not anime so lets not go down this road again.</br>  <br> lets not go down this road again <br>Well, as it should be obvious from the post that started this, , I wasn't motivated to have a discussion about it in first place. It's usually those who scream tumblr SJW landwhale feminazi who start shit and derail threads.<br><br>Having said that I rest my case and pretend that nothing happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You're not fitting in, faggot. <br>I wasn't the only one telling you to go back to Tumblr.<br><br>Stick around though, I'm sure you can change the place by acting like an angry feminist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it just me or does Komari look a bit pregnant in this picture?</br>  <br>In the 2010's, it's the Liberals who are the oversensitive prudes, and the conservatives are the pro-free speech dirty joke tellers<br><br>No clue why it flip flopped recently. Blame feminism I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>More like you rest your case because your brain is slowly realizing that your argument was retarded.</br>  I wouldn't say AOTS myself, but it's surprisingly smart. Not what I was expecting based on screenshots I saw, but still very fun.  <br>CGDCT is clearly /a/'s favorite genre and NNB is as well-executed of a CGDCT show as you'll find, any year. It's produced as well as ARIA or K-ON. NNB was also /a/'s 2013 AOTY, if you remember correctly, so this shouldn't be surprising at all.</br>  <br>Liberals aren't oversensitive prudes, they just don't want media to portray men as rapist beasts (and glorify this as if it's a positive representation of them) and portray women as wanton sluts who can't get enough dickings from said rapists.<br><br>Back in the time they called sexual liberation "free love." On the meanwhile there's no fucking stain of *love* left.<br><br><br>No arguments have been made in the posts of the person you're quoting. Merely a personal preference was stated. Now stop shitposting and starting to stir up shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about GATE threads specifically, but the anime itself isn't very /pol/ at all. The plot is basically modern Japan vs fantasy world GO.</br>  <br>No I feel you. Im just letting you know not everyone is retarded like  and </br>  <br> I don't remember what they called me before that. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/livejournal/</br></br>  <br>I dunno, it's just always liberals I see about wanting to ban words, censor images, and generally decide what is and isn't moral to say, do, and show. <br><br>Whenever a video game has any sort of ultra violent or ultra sexual content, it's usually college age liberals making a fuss about it, not conservative soccer moms.</br></br></br>  <br> Back in the time they called sexual liberation "free love." On the meanwhile there's no fucking stain of *love* left. <br>Nigga are you serious? It was like that since the beginning</br></br>  <br> CGDCT <br>what</br></br>  <br><br>To elaborate on this, I just counted the number of images on the /a/ catalog right now with "moe" styled girls in them. 86 out of 148. /a/'s demographics are what they are, man. This is a "moe" board, and it always has been. Early /a/'s two favorite anime were Evangelion (largely discussing the "moe points" of Asuka and Rei) and Azumanga Daioh. This season, two of /a/'s three favorite anime are NNB and Working!!! It is what it is.</br></br>  <br>You need to lurk far more faggot</br>  <br> *love* <br>You're being a little obvious.</br></br>  <br>Cute Girls Doing Cute Things. Lurkmoar.</br>  <br>It depends.

Only ARIA has ever made me this happy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128442447 <br> moeshit <br>No, on /v/ it's called moeshit. Only crossboarder scum calls it that. You really need to lurk more or fuck off.<br><br> spoonfeeding info that he can get on google <br>You're just as bad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you actually did that I feel bad for you and you should seek help.</br>  <br>Did you just post your reviews?</br>  <br>Okay, I get that NNB is ~healing~, but since when is it funny? And since when is Aria funny?</br>  <br>oh hey its you again</br>  <br><br>Sure, I'll go discuss Akagami, or Magi, or Souma with /v/. Oh wait.<br><br>Grow up. Not everyone in /a/ is into moeshit.  And I've probably been here for much longer than you have. </br></br></br></br>  <br> you feel bad that I work at home and can fuck around on /a/ during downtime as I please <br>I'm livin' the dream nigga.<br><br>It's pretty fun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok you are living the dream indeed my dear anon no one is denying that but you definitely should seek help.</br>  <br>I personally find NNB's humor to be tastefully and effectively executed, but humor is as subjective of a thing as there is. That being said, I didn't say anything about either of them being funny. Funny things aren't the only thing that make people happy.</br>  <br>You seem confused. There is nothing wrong with not being a fan of CGDCT, but calling it moeshit makes you /v/ tier cancer</br>  <br>The manga has only 2 chapters, is the LN translated already? Because I was wondering where they got their source from and I figured out it was the LN.</br>  Non Non is shit, Shimoneta is the real deal.  <br>W-whoa. <br>No one can be this new, right?</br></br>  <br>The problem isn't liking or not liking "moeshit," it's using the term "moeshit," period, to describe an imaginary genre. The only two conclusions one can come to regarding someone using this term unironically are:<br>- They are an ignorant fuck and need to lurk the fuck moar;<br>- They are using the term intentionally for the purpose of trolling.<br>Either one of these cases is shitposting. Thus, if you use "moeshit," unironically, you are a shitposter and should vacate /a/.<br> seems to like shitposters, as there seems to be a lot of them there.

Do other characters in her series try to experience her softness?<br><br>(Mai has quite a full figure despite being athletic, so I'd say she's pretty soft. Two of her friends like to feel her up on occasion for that reason.)</br></br>  <br>Bewitching<br>Bespectacled <br>Beauty!<br><br><br>Have not, and she doesn't prioritize things like that.

Hotheaded, serious and fragile.<br><br>Never, apart from the one time she wore a tiara as a part of her ballerina outfit for a talent show.<br><br> She has at least some soft parts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Devine, Stalwart and Perceptive.<br>A mere three adjectives of the many I could ascribe to her.<br><br>Not often, Rukia's outfits are usually quite simple, she does not adorn herself in jewelery of any kind unless it's a special occasion.<br><br>Not very, Rukia has a rather petite figure lacking the required assets to appear 'soft'.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Persistent, dutiful, sexy.<br><br>Soft as a plank of wood.</br></br></br>  <br>minchi is kind, hard working and dorky</br>    Playful, Joyful, and Ambitious.<br><br><br>Sometimes. I think that would dampen her active lifestyle.<br><br><br>I think she would be soft in some places but mostly firm because she is quite active.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>me</br>  <br>Streaming?</br>  Draw your waifu  <br>I like your taste anon. I'm a Nozomi man myself, but I can definitely respect your choice.</br>  You and your waifu are attending a ball with all other waifus and husbandos.

Yuzuko is smart, lovely and lively.<br><br><br>She's not the type to wear lots of jewelry.<br><br><br>It's hard to say. She's very funny and does a lot of funny things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Could your waifu beat a Tyrannosaurus in a fight?  <br>This reminds me, does anyone have Kirari as their waifu?</br>  <br>Attempt art.<br><br>Easily, without a doubt.</br></br></br>  <br>Perceptive, Lovely, Persistent<br><br><br>Unless you count her hair pins, she does not wear any jewelry.  Besides our wedding ring. <br><br><br>She's athletic, but she definitely looks pretty soft. Pic Related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai doesn't really do jokes or pranks. She tends to react to things done by her friends instead. One running gag involving her is that she loves the cooking of one of her friends which sends almost everyone who tastes it to the hospital.<br><br>If Mai used magic to boost her physical abilities I think that she'd have the strength and speed necessary to take out a T. rex.</br></br></br>  Your waifu demands intensely pleasurable anal sex?<br><br>Are you skilled and endowed well enough to provide her with it?</br></br>  Is your waifu active? Would she rather hang out with you outdoors, such as a road trip, picnic, or the ocean, or indoors, such as at home, in a cafe, or a restaurant?  <br>She tried to say the English word "leader" and she sounded so incredibly adorable i couldn't stop laughing<br><br><br>She's more of an indoors person but she doesn't seem to mind going outside</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well she is a fun girl but not really a funny one.<br><br><br>No way, she is just a normal girl.<br><br><br>She is totally active, she would choose road trips, picnics and the ocean.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks OP, you're waifu a beautiful too!<br><br>3 adjectives I would choose is - cool, beautiful and quirky<br><br><br>Usually, she wears earrings in the shape of a daimond. At formal events, Erza can be seen wearing more elegant clothes and jewelry. In pic related she is wearing a gold necklace and ruby earrings. <br><br><br>I think she would be quite soft in some areas, but obviously she would also be toned as well due to all her fighting and training. She's actually more likely to feel other girl's softness than the other way round.<br><br><br>I'd say the funniest thing she has done was when she got drunk and started rebuking her other guild members, however she got all their names wrong!<br><br><br>I think she's generally more of an outdoors type so a picnic would be nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does your waifu have any cool or interesting hobbies?  <br>Honk is a very close second</br>  <br>Intelligent, dutiful, driven. Formerly melancholic.<br><br><br>Nope, she's rather plain in that sense, despite the goth lolita attire.<br><br><br>She's hardly "soft", but she turned into a big softie inside as people came to her help in the series.<br><br><br>She isn't very funny.<br><br><br>Shinobu isn't very active and she's more of an indoor person.<br><br><br>She has slightly offbeat fashion sense and likes tea, but that's not massively interesting.<br><br><br>What are some problems in her life you'd be able or like to solve? How about vice versa?<br><br>I'll answer this one; for most of her life, Shinobu always saw the world as dark and in her own words, twisted and ugly, and tried to solve problems via taking them on herself. Through the course of the series she gained more faith in the world and especially when people came to aid. I want her never to feel alone or adrift again - the world isn't sunshine, but it isn't hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quiet, intelligent, sleepy.<br><br><br>Does a hairband count? Otherwise, nothing.<br><br><br>She's small, rather than soft. Small and cute. <br><br><br>If she had a tank, yeah. Otherwise, maybe not.<br><br><br>Definitely not active. But you can still be lazy outdoors.<br><br><br>Sensha-do is pretty cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its called horriblesubs for a reason.</br>  <br>aww shit, you defeated !YUNOcchiS2's script <br><br>How?</br></br></br>  I haven't been in one of these for a few years but I just wanted to say your waifu a cute. Keep the love alive waifuanons.  Say something nice about a random waifu!  <br>so, your waifu is a no name, original piece of whore?</br>  <br>She sings, and plays all sorts of instruments.<br><br><br><br>Mako is a talented individual. I'm sure she won't have difficulties navigating through life.<br><br>Would you set up a small business with you're waifu?<br>Maybe a flower shop, coffee shop, a bookstore, bakery, or even an audio equipment store?<br><br> I think running an audio store with Miku would be incredibly fun. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, she plays vidya and hangs out wirh friends.<br><br><br>I would love to make her a more mature and responsible person.<br><br><br>Fuuka's shyness makes her really cute, also dat short hair.<br><br><br>A bakery or a small restaurant sounds nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erza likes to read novels that are a bit inappropriate, but apart from that, I guess her major hobby is collecting armours to use.<br><br><br>I'd like to help her overcome her fear of letting others into her problems, as she always tries to solve everything by herself. This is a problem she's gradually solving by herself, but still, I would to do anything to help her. <br><br><br>Rukia has a very strong will and I like how she cares deeply about her friends. <br><br><br>I would love to work in a sweet shop with Erza. I'm sure we would be very happy together.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Date ideas with waifu?  <br>Help her every now and then with her job.</br>  Levia-San<br><br>Adorable, strong and funny</br></br>  <br>Lazy, flirty, ace.<br><br><br>Nope, she comes from a reasonably well-off family but you'd never guess it!<br><br><br>Not very. She has my preferred petite figure.<br><br><br>Where to start? The most obvious example is stealing a colleague's shimapan, causing a chaotic chain reaction of pantsu-stealing around the base.<br><br><br>Easily.<br><br><br>Not in the least! We go on dates but nothing beats relaxing indoors together.<br><br><br>Uh... sleeping, eating, reading... interesting to me at least!<br><br><br>Dokuro is hilarious and has a radiant smile!<br><br><br>Fighting the Neuroi. The war is the only problem but she does a great job in dealing with it. She's already helped me through a lot of the issues I had as a result of my crappy upbringing, including anxiety, anger and an opiate addiction. If it weren't for Erica, I'd be homeless or possibly dead. Instead, I have my own apartment with her and I'm a much better person than I used to be. I owe her everything.<br><br> 128437910 <br>Nope, it's not our thing.<br><br><br>If I had any, I'd tell you. We just go out, improvise and have fun. It's wise to have a backup plan in mind to fill in any gaps, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuzuko is pretty active, but at the same time she can be pretty lazy; it really depends on her mood. That would depend on how she felt at the moment, although anywhere would be fun as long as we were together.<br><br><br>She does read a bit, and look up random things on Wikipedia.<br><br><br>Miyako has very nice hair.<br><br><br>Running a coffee shop with her would be wonderful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  strong, sexy, and tomboy  <br><br>Yuzuko is the life of her friendships!<br><br><br>I wouldn't mind if I had a bit of a nest egg built up. I'd love an audio or hobby shop, and she could keep me in check if I do something stupid or end up being sick of something I previously liked. She would probably prove better at talking to people than I.<br><br><br>Take her out to a nice cafe and pamper her a bit. This will also allow her to dress up if she likes.<br><br>What is the craziest thing your waifu has done?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You are waifu a shit.  How many people have hentaifu, do you think? Threads about the latter tend to get quite long.  I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  <br> Oh my, you're too kind. Miku is likewise a talented young lass, as well as being super cute. <br>A bookstore would be great. Maybe with a little cafe at the front so people can drink tea while they read.<br><br><br>Woodland picnics, walks (piggyback rides) through the countryside, that sort of thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confident, Teasing, Controlling<br><br>None<br><br>She has arcane and technological stuff at her disposal so fairly soft, I think she averages at around 2 place in levels of soft in her series.<br><br>Break the 4th wall and be aware<br><br>Easily<br><br>Anything I like, she likes<br><br>Teach her how to play fighting games<br><br> Good luck guessing who she is </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mai is pretty fit and has been out on excursions. I think she's fine with either indoor or outdoor activities.<br><br>She doesn't really have a specific hobby. She just hangs out with her friends in her free time. She's very skilled in swordsmanship if that counts.<br><br>Mai is pretty capable and willing to address her problems. Her main goal is to prove herself to her father, which is something I think she'd want to do by herself.<br><br>I was at the right place at the right time.<br> <br>Miyako shows great persistence.<br><br>Mai is of aristocratic descent so, while she has no hangups about her lineage and isn't snobbish, I do not think it would be fitting for her. Also I wouldn't want that either.<br><br>Deliberately? Sneaking into her school with her friends at night in order to investigate the 7 mysteries of the campus, which ended up setting off all of the building's defensive systems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful<br>Overachiever<br>Cheeky<br><br>She does! She's often shown wearing necklaces and has pierced ears. I absolutely love her silver heart earrings.<br><br>She has a round, soft face, which is noted a few times.<br>Other than that, her thighs and stuff look soft but I can't imagine they're terribly soft considering she's an athletic model.<br><br>She runs track and field, but I feel like she would like a mix of both. Maybe a picnic and a jog, and then cool down with some iced coffee in a cafe.<br><br>She's a 14-16 year old girl who's into loli imouto eroge/media, I'd say that's pretty interesting.<br><br>Shinobu's EGL fashion is super cute!<br><br>I think running a clothing shop with her would be very nice, since both of us are experienced with fashion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Determined<br>Decisive<br>Radiant <br><br><br>Not unless hairclips count.<br><br><br>Only in the sense of having a curvy figure. <br><br><br>Planned and executed an overcomplicated Count of Monte Cristo revenge scheme in a failed attempt to destroy her evil, abusive mom.<br><br><br>I can't imagine how, but I'm confident she'd find a way.<br><br><br>She doesn't like sitting around, and she stays in shape, but I wouldn't really call her "active" in the athletic sense. When she has downtime we relax at home, or get together with friends. About once a year, we plan a sightseeing vacation. <br><br><br>She likes reading nonfiction books, mostly history and biographies of famous leaders. She also enjoys live music, especially classical. <br><br><br>I want to support her as she deals with her history of sexual abuse. <br><br>She wants me to be more self-confident.<br><br><br>She already runs a major fashion label. I'm not heavily involved in either the business or creative sides of it, but it can still be fun and interesting to tag along. Last spring, we got to meet Derek Zoolander!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fighting superpowered bad guys with superpowers sounds pretty cool, and collecting mountains of seductive lingeries is super interesting.<br><br>I have only known improv and last minute, but it has always worked out. Doesn't help, I know.<br><br>Trying to stop an armed robbery when she was probably 10 was pretty crazy, and stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you!<br>Beautiful, intelligent, demure.<br><br>No, she doesn't. She doesn't place a lot of importance on material possessions.<br><br>I'd say relatively. Unless her scars take away from that.<br><br>No.<br><br>She'd rather stay indoors, preferably alone with each other.<br><br>She likes to read. There's also a game she plays with the tiles on the floor of the school, but not much else. Pretty boring.<br><br>Well, the obvious answer would be her anxiety and self loathing. At the same time, I don't want to "solve" them for her, because at the end of the day, they're her problems she has to deal with. I guess I want to be her support, to make her believe she's worth all the live I could give her and to help her help herself.<br><br>Sure! Probably a bookstore; she loves reading.<br><br>Dinner somewhere quiet, maybe a walk in a park somewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw feeling lazy to reply all these questions   <br>I have been too lazy to answer for the past six months.  That and answering the same shit for the 200th time doesn't help either </br>  <br>Sometimes I try to bring some funny questions to break the ice.  Like what would Anon do if he caught his waifu baneposting <br><br>I want people to be innovative with questions.</br></br></br>  <br>Dirty, perverse, and adorable.<br><br><br>On stage, most likely (have to get facial tones right so you don't look pale on stage). Off the stage, I'm not too sure about that.<br><br><br>Sadly, no. <br><br><br>Tell the team working on the Amaburi PV to add  muscular men  in it.<br><br><br>Not a chance.<br><br><br>She's sociable, but would most likely want to stay indoors and work on her doujin circle's latest work.<br><br><br>Writing BL doujins would probably cool if I was into that.<br><br><br>Helping the park she works at to reach its expected visitor numbers.<br><br><br><br>Your waifu has a strong integrity and unwavering morals.<br><br><br>Running a doujin store with her would be a blast, we'd bicker endlessly over which genres should go in which areas.<br><br><br>Go somewhere garden-related. I'll improvise the rest.<br><br><br>See my 4th response.<br><br><br>You have no determination.<br><br>Does she have any erogenous zones? If so, then where?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's very active and much more of an outdoors person, a hobby of hers is climbing high places, like trees and telephone poles.<br><br>Again, she enjoys climbing high places when outside.<br>She also loves to draw, and has an obsessive nature about 'cute things' namely bunnies.<br><br>Throughout her growth as a character she has overcome most if not all of her emotional faults, such as accepting companionship as a positive thing, defeating past trauma, and allowing herself to seek help from others instead of bottling it all inside.<br>I'd like to keep things this way, no matter what it takes.<br>However, as of right now, she is surrounded by danger and death, I wish I was able to provide absolute safety for her, however that is something I cannot do.<br><br>As for her aiding me, Rukia is top tier motivator, she is definitely the 'Get up and go.' force within me allowing me to get shit done.<br><br>I really like Shinobu's hair.<br><br>Why not? Sounds fun.<br>A local toy store in which she both designs and creates cute children's toys while I manage the shop itself.<br><br>Ah, thank you!<br><br>I don't have too many ideas, just relaxing someplace secluded and high up, in a tree, atop a roof or something.<br><br>Giving her powers to a human, committing a felon resulting in a death sentence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Slut, slut, and slut.</br>  <br>I'd love to have a nice relaxing picnic with her underneath a cherry blossom tree.<br><br><br>I think the craziest thing she has done is take on 100 different enemies at the same time, and won.<br><br><br>Apart from the usual zones for a girl her age, she does not have special erogenous zones.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What does your waifu's  navel  taste like?  <br>Kind, strong, beautiful.<br><br><br>She wears a necklace for more formal things, but that's about it.<br><br><br>She's pretty active, but she looks very soft.<br><br><br>Some of her reactions are pretty funny.<br><br><br>Yes.<br><br><br>She's very active and outside a lot, so something indoors would be nice.<br><br><br>Her magic is really cool.<br><br><br>Erica is a great pilot and witch.<br><br><br>I wouldn't mind something like that, but she likes what she does now and I wouldn't want her to stop.<br><br><br>It would be nice to go out for dinner at a small restaurant.<br><br><br>Most of the fights she gets in are pretty crazy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does your waifu appear in a VN? If so, does it contain any CGs where she is naked?  <br>Just go outside, eat, have fun, watch a movie or something, come home, play vidya and cuddle.<br><br><br>Eating food from the floor.<br><br><br>Tasty genki skin.<br><br><br>She does, kinda, and no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, OP!<br>Cute, innocent, wonderful<br><br><br>Only a little if any. She might wear one or two small things like hair pin, but nothing exaggerated.  She would wear our wedding ring <br><br><br>She has soft, smooth skin but she is rather skinny.<br><br><br>Miku isn't really funny person.<br><br><br>I've tried, it was really bad.<br><br><br>No, she is just a normal girl.<br><br><br>Both, but she isn't very active. If we would like to spend time outside, we would just walk around or relax somewhere.<br><br><br>Yes, she sings and she is great. I love her voice.<br><br><br>Nothing serious but she is timid and shy. I would love to help her improve her self esteem.<br>She would heal me from my depression. Just her being her to me and loving me would solve everything.<br><br><br>Shinobu is really smart.<br><br><br>Music or flower shop sounds nice. However I don't really know if that's something I would do because I love programming<br><br><br>If she was real or as waifu?<br>Either way I would go stargazing. Even if she will only be in form of figure or picture on phone.<br><br><br>Sweat?<br><br><br>No special zones, only normal ones.<br><br><br>Yes in few. She does have eroge VNs but I've only played nonH one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cute, energetic, caring.<br><br><br>Doesn't seem like it.<br><br><br>I'm sure Miku is really soft. I like imagining how holding her hand must feel like.  Despair... <br><br><br>There are a lot of cute, funny moments I've seen in videos, but none that have made me laugh really hard. Sucks having a dark/filthy sense of humor.<br><br><br>I don't think so...but being really light on her feet and being petite, I'm sure she'd manage to escape.<br><br><br>Very. She dances beautifully and often. If I had her by my side, I'd probably regain my will to live. I'm not fond of the outdoors, unless it's a relaxing, quiet, and uncrowded place.<br><br><br>Music. I'm interested, to a degree, and I've thought of wanting to make my own, but my creativity is limited. I'd like to give it a try, but I wouldn't want it as a job. <br><br><br>I'm not sure. Although I'd like to make her the happiest girl in the universe.<br><br><br>Same. I've been busy, tired, and depressed as usual, but I thought I'd drop by. Didn't want people to think that I was just another Mikufag that came and went.<br><br><br>Her...?<br><br><br>What kind of weather does your waifu prefer? What kind do you prefer?<br><br> I imagine Miku would like the typical sunny, partly cloudy , breezy day. I prefer rainy days though. I loved the time it rained hard for a week. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  wedding day with wifu<br>wedding night with wifu<br>waking up morning after to empty bed<br>going downstairs and seeing wifu busy making breakfast wearing nothing but an apron<br>wifu happily humming to herself and shaking her hips, not knowing you're watching</br></br></br></br>  <br>If her necklace thing counts, then she does.<br><br><br>Nepgear seems really soft and cuddly.<br><br><br>There was a scene in Mk2, which I'm not sure is removed in RB2, but  naked butler BL game event.  One of the funniest things.<br><br><br>Well, there's the chance, considering she can destroy huge robots and Arfoire.<br><br><br>I'm not sure about the stuff that isn't shown during the games, but I imagine she's somewhat active, when not busy with work.<br><br><br>Her love for tech/robots is pretty cool.<br><br><br>I'm not sure, one would probably be close emotional support to make her feel a lot more confident.<br><br><br>One thing would be 1v1ing the the end boss I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Perhaps Mai would be interested in visiting a museum covering the middle ages.<br><br>Tell her that she's a big girl.<br><br>Presumably just the default ones. Nothing suggests that she differs from a normal girl in that respect.<br><br>She pays attention to her personal hygiene so I think her navel would be clean and thus the same as the rest of her skin.<br><br>Yes, Mai does star in a VN segment that's part of a larger game. She appears naked when she visits a hot spring.<br><br>Mai dislikes cold weather, so I imagine that she'd prefer a warm, sunny day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't disagree with that. <br>Fun, Happy, and Beautiful <br><br><br>Yes, she wears nail polish and make-up and she's always seen with her necklace. <br><br><br>Yes she's very soft. Suzu likes to touch her every now and then. <br><br><br>Hard to say, but I guess her reactions to things. <br><br><br>Does this answer the question? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YbB<wbr>plp1PmiQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>I'll provide her with anything she desires. <br><br><br>I say she's a mixture of both, but leaning more to outside. <br><br><br>She's part of a band. In her spare time she plays video games and plays with her cats. <br><br><br>I want to fill in the emptiness she had in her childhood <br><br><br>Yeah I would probably do an audio store too, sell her albums there and other stuff. <br><br><br>I would like to have a nice stroll in the park with her and then go on a picnic and looks at the sky<br>together. <br><br><br>Fight off zombies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strong-willed, dazzling, priceless.<br><br><br>Don't think so. The only time she'd possibly wear stuff like that is formal occasions.<br><br><br>The softest.<br><br><br>Sounds like a tall order, but I think she could handle it.  Velociraptors are cooler. <br><br><br>Very active. A road trip with her sounds really fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What personal pronoun does your waifu use?  <br><br>War??????????????</br></br>  <br>Yes she is!<br>Cute<br>Energetic<br>Assertive<br><br><br>Does her hair ornaments count?<br><br><br>She's super soft, but she's more on the flat side.<br><br><br>It's more situational for her than just trying to be funny.<br><br><br>Definately not, but I'm sure she'd want to wreck havoc with a Tyrannosaurus<br><br><br>She is active! She would like to hang out, but to more urban paces, like downtown shops, malls, amusement parks, and such.<br><br><br>Of course, she's an interesting girl! I do like the sports she's particularly good at.<br><br><br>I'm not entirely sure. If anything, I'd just want to be there to help her in any way possible<br><br><br>Kobori's hairstyle is pretty nice.<br><br><br>A bakery, for sure<br><br><br>A relaxing dinner in the night<br><br><br>Jump and flip between the school balconies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's usually the once reacting to other's crazy antics, but her losing it during the exhibition fight was quite hilarious.<br><br>Only if she has a tank.<br><br>Hard to say since she's always very busy, but she was really looking forward to the school trip in the OVAs.<br><br>She keeps a mysterious diary about her best friend.<br><br>I'm certainly not the best person for it, but I'd like to mellow her temper a bit, so that she can enjoy herself more.<br><br>Miyako makes cute faces.  Is it frowned upon complimenting your own waifu when no one else does? <br><br>A bakery sounds fun.<br><br>Taking over a school through rebuking.<br><br>Her pointer when attached to a tank gun's trigger.<br><br>Peaches and delicious sweat.<br><br>No, and even if there were it's next to impossible that she'd be naked (barring hot spring scenes with a lot of anti-fun steam).<br><br>Watashi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed.<br>Beutiful, Intelligent and smart.<br><br>In the anime she doesn't but i think in the manga she does.<br><br>She's very soft, and most girls in her school would like to have her figure.<br><br>Caling the police at the 2nd episode of the anime, the first time i saw it i laughed like 5 min.<br><br> tfw not drawfag <br><br>Nope.<br><br>Kinda is, she still loves playing vidya all day, so it's occasional if we would go somewhere.<br><br>Playing vidya, and making vidya!<br><br>I wanna make her more confident, since she got a lot of potential, just she's not aware of how good she can be.<br><br>Your waifu a cute too, anon.<br><br>Everyone's waifu a cute.<br> Along with the anons and trips. <br><br>Yea, but not something like a shop.<br>Running a game company maybe, something big.<br><br>Playing vidya all day until we fell asleep, and cuddle while doing so.<br><br>She haven't done anything crazy.  Yet. <br><br>It happens sometimes, anon.<br>You don't have to answer all the questions if you don't want to.<br><br>Don't know.<br><br> Sweat  ? <br><br>No, nope.<br><br><br>Thought it was the same guy for a while.<br><br>But to answer the 2nd Miku, Spring for my waifu and Winter for me.<br><br>She's just a highschooler, so it's pretty much all the informal ones.<br><br>If you could go to any universe of any anime, where would you go?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not very, and would prefer a nice cafe.<br><br><br>She reads lots of manga!<br><br><br>A nice little book shop!<br><br><br>A nice trip to the mall. We see some nice things, sit on the bench and talk, buy a few things. It sounds lovely.<br><br><br>Overreact to the idea of Mitsuru and MC talking alone. It pushed her to solve her own problem in the end though, so it ultimately worked for the better.<br><br><br>That's lewd!<br><br><br>Watashi<br><br><br>Hers obviously</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All of your waifus are lovely hamsters!  <br>Hmmmm~ a man can dream~&lt;3<br><br><br>Watashi.<br><br><br>Lucky Star world of course.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She currently uses "watashi", though Mai had used "boku" in the past.<br><br>Visiting her universe would be nice, but it's a pretty screwed up place so I wouldn't want to live there.</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully sweet.<br><br><br>Afraid she does not appear in any VNs.<br><br><br>I'm sure she prefers nice weathers, sunny but not humid. That way she can train outside and do missions without too much trouble<br><br><br>She uses a mixture of ore, boku and watashi<br><br><br>Definitely hers of course! It would be amazing to go on an adventure with her!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying I'm not the one getting up early to make breakfast for her </br>  <br>Mysterious, sisterly, cool<br><br>By all means, yes. She seems especially fond of this one aquamarine amulet she always keeps on her person.<br><br>Pretty soft. The other girls tend to be quite envious at times.<br><br>Squeeing while trying to do a cover of Miku's 'PoPiPo' song.<br><br>How well can a T-Rex handle tentacles?<br><br>Somewhat active. She's not exactly a fitness nut, but she does have a figure to maintain.<br><br>She's an active tuna fisher.<br><br>We're both pretty aloof and reserved. If we want to make things work, we both have to learn how to open up about things. Especially me.<br><br>I like the idea of a bakery or a small cafe. With me behind the scenes doing all the cooking, of course.<br><br>Trip to the movies. A nice romantic dinner to her favorite restaurant. Wasting the day away at the local amusement park.<br><br>Either start a relationship with me, or suplexing a tuna as big as her.<br><br>Who knows?  I like to think her digits or the curve of her neck, but I'm eager to find out if there are others. <br><br>Beach weather. The kind where she could frolic around in the water.<br><br>Didn't even have to look at the chart. She uses 'boku'<br><br>....This is a lot of questions...<br><br><br>A universe where one could be with their special one always.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Brave, Beautiful and Cute<br><br><br>Not really. Atleast not for the daily stuff.<br><br><br>The softest.<br><br><br>Hard to say: She makes me smile every day.<br><br><br>Probably.<br><br><br>She is a very active and fit personality. Yes.<br><br><br>Not really. Atleast nothing you could consider a hobby.<br><br><br>Her problems in the show were kinda overwhelming big but i would still do my best to help.<br><br><br>Rias has very beautiful hair.<br><br><br>I would love to work with her. Be it in her business or a new one.<br><br><br>1girl 1boy<br>candlelight<br>sofa<br>cuddling<br><br><br>Jumping in a G0 zone from the top of a huge building?<br><br><br>Thats a question only she can truly answer.<br><br><br> Honey  ? <br><br><br>She makes a short appearance near the end but only in one image and not really related to the plot.<br><br><br>Winter for me. Same goes for her i guess.<br><br><br>Watachi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has your waifu ever accidentally said something that could be perceived as innuendo?  <br>Probably sunny, warm summer days.<br>Nice spring days, when it's warm but not too hot and there is nice breeze.<br><br><br>I daydream about it often.<br><br><br>Watashi<br><br><br>Why start a war when there is virtually nothing to gain?<br><br><br>With her, you mean?<br>Near future sifi worlds always interest me. Places like Academic City or the city from Plastic Memories.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   I love my waifu   <br> Macaroons <br><br><br>Yes, she's the lead character, and I don't think so. <br><br><br> hfw she sees me <br><br><br>Watashi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Peaches.<br><br>No, I'm not aware of any Bleach VNs anyway.<br><br>Due to her outdoorsy nature, spring/summer time suits her best.<br>As for myself, I can handle to cold, but too much heat slays me.<br>Autumn is my preferred season.<br><br>Delightful.<br><br>Watashi<br><br>Nothing special I suppose.<br><br>I'd go to Bleach's universe and promptly die without even seeing her face.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yesterday was Akeno's birthday we had a good time <br><br><br>Beautiful, Sexy, and sadistic<br><br><br>No, no jewelry<br><br><br>She is the softest and biggest in her series<br><br><br>Yes, you know elemental and fallen angel magic obliterate them<br><br><br>Akeno is a very indoor type of person but there are times when she wants to go outside like the beach <br><br><br>Watching porn with her best friend<br><br><br>Id like to be able to solve the problem with the Himejima clan where they stop trying to kill her when she gets close to places they control<br><br><br>Fate is a good housewife<br><br><br>We would set up a bakery just to see her in an apron every day<br><br><br>Just being with her is a good date but going to a restaurant of her choosing <br><br><br>Almost killed a person on purpose<br><br><br>Her breasts are her main ones<br><br><br>Sweet<br><br><br>The Dxd verse though I do believe Dante is in it <br><br><br>Watakushi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Courageous, Curious, Cute<br><br>No jewelry in the traditional sense, though I could say that all the golden decorations are a sort of jewelry.<br><br>Only her face is soft  ;_; <br><br>She can be pretty funny even when not trying to. Sometimes, just believing ludicrous tales of ninjas, other times scaring people by breaking staplers, or simply crying out for help (should I say, halp).<br><br>Gonna have to summon the bigger guns.<br><br>Very active, likes to be outside and question her surroundings.<br><br>I wouldn't say observing people or trying to understand illogical means of operation is an interesting hobby, but it's the most interesting thing in the world to her.<br><br>Well, one of her initial issues is she can't quite come to terms with all kinds of new feelings and how "limiting" her nature is. I would want to support her and be there for her, so she would know such a thing does not need to be a problem.<br><br> T-Rex is the coolest dinosaur! <br><br>Nah, nothing like that. She's kinda soft on the inside and would think nothing of "you can pay later".<br><br>Paintball competition against each other!<br><br> Shoving the embodiment of Death itself into a young boy. <br><br>Silicon, I take it.<br><br>Arena has storyline sequences in VN mode. And no.<br><br>I don't think she ever mentions a preference, and seems equally fine with tropical island and freezing city cold.<br> I hate warm weather, and much prefer when it snows. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As by myself, i would go to her universe and/or go to keion too.<br> But would have to be a girl though, and that'll be the most difficult part. <br><br>She haven't said things like that, but her friends do that often.<br><br>And everyone knows what happens next.<br> Lots and lots of love <br><br>What boards would your waifu browse? Would she shitpost on certain ones, or maybe doing some OC?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Should I post about my waifu here? I want to talk about her to someone, but this seems kind of spergy.  <br>Love always feels spergy.<br>Keep it as simple as you want it to be.</br></br>  <br>just do it</br>  <br>It's as spergy as you want to make it, my man.</br>  <br>Not "spergy" IMO, but like  said, love is always spergy.</br>  With which waifus would your waifu like to be friends with? With which ones would she likely have problems?  <br>Mild<br>Thoughtful<br>Nurturing<br><br>Not really.<br><br>Unwittingly helped pull a prank on  a ghost <br><br>Fortune telling!<br><br>Probably gentler activities, like walking.<br>Knowing me, I'd have to be the active one, maybe take her to a trampoline gym with her sister.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like this, this is what I'm  talking about. I don't know your waifus. I just want to talk about mine and post cute pictures of her. I don't need to speculate about things like this. Are these threads not for me?</br>  <br> wants to talk about her <br> doesn't wanna speculate about her <br>I don't think I understand</br></br></br>  <br>Well, you're free too. Talk about your waifu and love for her.</br>  <br>There's no dicks for you to suck, sorry to disappoint. <br><br> I don't need to speculate about things like this. Are these threads not for me? <br> doesn't like speculation/Q&amp;A shit <br>No, not at all. This is pretty much all they are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The questions have never been required. Just say what you want to say.</br>  <br><br>Alright, sorry to be a bother. Have fun waifufriends.</br></br>  <br>Answering my question, she wouldn't shitpost but doing some OC at /tg/ and posting on /g/ and /v/ often.<br><br>But other than that, she might browse /cgl/ if she wants to cosplay.<br><br>Most waifus got supernatural powers, but she would hang out with everyone.<br><br>You would have to answer the questions though, but some people read what other posts, one example would be me.  But i don't read EVERYONE sometimes, since i don't have enough time <br><br>But if you're here just to talk about your waifu, then just answer the questions and don't talk to anyone then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not a bother.<br>If you wanna just post her, say you love her, then go your merry way, that's perfectly fine!</br></br>  <br>Don't worry anon, also this .</br>  <br>Probably like dirt.<br> That's fine, dirt actually doesn't taste half bad. <br><br>Never really saw her in one, and there's probably no reason for one to be made.<br><br>Any kind of weather would be fine with her, so long as it didn't get in the way of her duties.<br><br>Rejoice, for the VR age is upon us.<br><br>Watashi.<br><br>Hers, of course.<br><br>/y/'s a given, maybe a couple trips to /u/ to help Salama out with how to approach Muse.  All her advances end in disaster. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm guessing that entire depends on Yomiko's mood but I'd say she leans more towards indoors giving her introverted nature, however we'd have lots of picnics outside or maybe on her rooftop and visit a lot of literary landmarks on our outings together.<br><br><br><br>Literature<br><br><br><br>Yuno's smile can even brightens up even the darkest of hearts.<br><br><br><br>Bookshop together would be cute, it'd be closer to independent and not like how modern chain bookshops are run, think more akin to Black Books.<br><br>Actually I'd like to get Yomiko's thoughts on how modern bookshops are run, would be interesting, I wonder if she would hate the idea of coffee shops and bookshops being meshed together as much as I.<br><br><br><br>Library or bookshop, because who says a bookshop can't be a good date spot.<br><br><br><br>Travel halfway around the world to retrieve a book someone stole from her.<br><br><br><br>I'd love to find out but it's never revealed<br><br><br><br>Fleshy<br><br><br><br>Obviously Read or Die's.<br><br>Gundam UC or Leiji Matsumoto's would be fun too.<br><br><br><br>Erica, I think she and Yomiko would get along pretty well, plus they could fly in the Paper Plane together or her Striker Unit.<br><br>How are your waifu's homemaker skills?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cleaning, yes<br>Childcare and attending to injuries, yes<br>Cooking,  eventually </br></br></br>  You wake up one day only to find that you and your waifu  swapped gnders  for reasons unknown.

I love my beautiful miko!<br>We both wish you and your waifus eternal love and  financial income </br>  <br>She knows how to keep house pretty well. I mean, she kinda has to when she lives with the likes of Miku, Rin, Len, and the others. That said, though, I wouldn't mind in helping her keep house.<br><br><br>Go back to sleep, because it's far too early.<br><br><br>If she finds the time for it, then probably /an/ or /mu/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is already best friends with Rias but she could get along with everyone really<br><br><br>/e/ /h/ /ck/ and /fa/<br><br><br>Akeno likes it sunny with no clouds but she prefers it when its nightime I Iike it when it snows <br><br><br>When she licks fingers thats an innuendo <br><br><br>Cooking, check <br>Cleaning, check<br>Tending to injuries, healing magic<br>Taking care of children, check<br>Making a budget, check</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that I can remember.<br><br><br>Erza would be friends with anyone who wanted to be. I can't imagine her having any problems with anyone.<br><br><br>Based on her interests, I reckon she might browse /fa/ and maybe /ck/. <br><br><br>She keeps her room pretty well cleaned so I think she'd make for a great homemaker.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mature, Beautiful, Intelligent.<br><br>Not on a daily basis.<br><br>Very soft, other girls are jealous of her and tease her about it.<br><br>No.<br><br>She's fine with both outdoors and indoors.<br><br>Well she's part of a group, the bassist and singer.<br><br>I'd help her to get more confidence in herself and help her to lose the fear to some things.<br><br>Akeno has one of the greatest figures I've seen.<br><br>I would if that's what I want, but after having to help with the family bussiness I'm not really excited about it.<br><br>Eating, followed by shopping, a concert and bed.<br><br>Nothing that is weird enough to be considered crazy.<br><br>Shower gel?<br><br>She likes almost all types of weather, expect probably storms because she would be scared about the thunders.<br><br>Can't really remember right now, I guess watashi.<br><br>K-On universe obviously.<br><br>/mu/, /an/, /lit/<br><br>Good enough.<br><br>Probably the first thing I would do is tease her about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do you celebrate hump day with your waifu?  <br>To her own of course.<br>Or if you mean together, Rinne no Lagrange seems like a nice place.<br><br>Where do I even start?<br><br>/sci/, /m/, /tv/,  /adv/ <br><br>She'd want to be friends with everyone.<br>Except the evil ones.

Also I think that she'd be able to offer help to anyone else in the same boat.<br><br>Perhaps /k/ due to her interest in swordsmanship or /ck/ since she likes cooking for her friends.<br><br>Mai is pretty kind and friendly, so I think she'd do well with most girls. I think she'd do badly with those that are evil, since she wouldn't allow them to harm others and would thus come into conflict with them.<br><br>Mai is an excellent cook and enjoys doing housework such as cleaning. Also she's good with children and responsible. I'd say that she'd be an excellent homemaker, though she does have ambitiins that go beyond that so she wouldn't be satisfied with just such a role.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Super Sonico The Animation. Where else? <br><br><br>Probably /a/, /v/, and /cgl/. I don't think she's the type of person to shit post. <br><br><br>She gets along with people very well.

Guts is a shit person for other reasons.</br>    <br>Berserk isn't edgy</br>  <br>It surprises me how Hellsing never makes it to these "edgy meymey" threads. It's like some teenagers secondaries make these threads</br>  <br>Yes and the sky isn't blue.</br>  <br>Guts has better reasons to be a shit person</br>  <br>The sky is technically not blue at night</br>  <br>How is it edgy to use the historical past of a character based upon a historical person?</br>  <br>Someone doesnt know history. Vlad was actually raped, probably hundreds of times as a child.</br>  <br>Griifith has been tortured during 1 year , i think it's a good reason to become insane .</br>  <br><br> Implying Vlad wasn't a literal edgelord </br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Griifith going insane was justified but Guts had all but two of his friends killed because of someone who he saw as a very close friend after saving that friend from the torture, then having his eyes gouged out again because of Griifith summoned demons and saw his girlfriend raped in a pool of their friends blood and who raped her? Griifith, both have their reasons to be horrible people, but Guts has way more</br>  <br>Berserk is supposed to be edgy.</br>  You can choose basically any page from this manga if you'd like.  Mandatory  <br> chapter 01 end <br><br>Seems like that escalated very quickly.</br></br></br>    <br>Akame ga Kill. The entire manga.</br>  <br>Magi has a lot of them.</br>  <br> Reverse google image search <br> Finds out its called Molester Man </br></br>  <br> Didn't know/read Molester Man yet <br>Seriously? Get on that shit.</br></br>  <br>Speaking of which.</br>  <br>Why exactly do all these world leaders want to kill Ali Baba instead of Sinbad?</br>  <br>Do they? I thought it was just Hakuryuu.</br>  <br>Just Hakuryuu. For various reasons, most obvious is that he sided with Kouen.</br>  <br>You don't have a whole lot of friends do you?</br>  <br>Wasn't there a manga where the main dude had to kill all his loved ones in order to become stronger? Like this girl confesses to him and he kills her right after?</br>  Which manga is the one thats like an rpg and the dude has to kill his team to level up?  <br> Wasn't there a manga where the main dude had to kill all his loved ones in order to become stronger <br>Yes... that's Naruto.</br></br>  <br><br>Hivemind my nigga</br></br>  <br>Found it</br>  <br>I may regret getting into this?</br>  <br>just Hakuryuu and mostly because Sinbad makes him his bitch every time they interact</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128439562 <br>Yakushoku Distpiari<br>reverse image search helps</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128439562 <br><br>Reverse the image then search it people.<br><br>He bangs her the night before this page</br></br></br></br>  <br> whyboner.jpg </br>  <br>Don't start crying now you little wuss, maybe you'll do better next time.</br>  <br> "edgy" <br> naruto shit <br><br/></br></br></br>          <br> the zombie killa <br>It's not edgy, it QUALITY</br></br>  Any other pussies who can't stand edgyness or is it just me?  <br>Just you  faggot </br>  <br>Who could enjoy it?</br>  <br>Nobody here enjoys it, but it's a whole 'nother thing to actually be pussied out by it.</br>  most of this shit isn't edgy.<br><br>Fags need to learn the definition of edgy</br></br>  <br>We can't exactly just post shapes on /a/.</br>   Every page from Tokyo Ghoul   <br>I know what it is, I was just asking for an opinion. Edgy or not it's a rare plot development these days</br>  /thread  <br>This<br>Pretty much every instance of Kaneki since his hair turned white</br></br>  <br>Usually people who can distinguish fiction from reality</br>    <br>The entire manga is an edgy escalator. It's muh revenge, muh jealousy, muh hate this existence and muh pain all around.</br>  <br>Taken out of context, this just seems like limbs are currency or something in that world. <br><br>Judar probably cut off his hand and tossed it over after this page.</br></br></br>  <br>"I may have accidentally made a baby with you!"</br>  <br> /pol/ in a single page </br>  <br>Looks like a page of bleach translated by manganiggers</br>  I love it do death but damn Bastard is edgy as fuck,  <br>If anyone can be in Hiatus longer than Togashi and Miura put together, that has to be Hagiwara</br>  <br>I prefer this myself</br>  <br>Holy shit why you've got to remind us? I'm sad again.</br>  the entire manga is an edge fest. i expect nothing less from the man that made drakengard.  Goddamn, this is edgy.  this is so edge it becomes funny. you just want her to burn them all.  <br>Well he has always been a lazy fuck.<br><br>Does he even continue this manga or did he finally get tired of it ? Finished a reread last week and would love some closure since I'm reading this Manga for 15 years by now.</br></br></br>    <br>how about light novels?<br> “There is no currency within Slaughter City, any food and drink are provided free of charge. Of course, poisonous ones are not excluded. Here, dead people are the most valuable. The number of human skulls each person possess symbolizes their strength. The blood and skulls of the opponents you’ve personally beheaded can be used to trade for other goods.” </br></br>  <br>I like when it is reasonably edgy.</br>  <br>doge edit when?</br>  <br> It was bothersome, so I killed him. <br>It's lines like these that come off as comedic.</br></br>  Literally edgy  <br>Is this a meme?</br>  <br>Anybody can see that he is being edgy as fuck here.</br>  What's the difference between dark and edgy?  <br> The other girl will never get to have f/u/n time with Ayana </br>  <br>He also probably raped hundreds of women when he was a feudal lord<br>  %90 human history is actually consists of endless rape cycle </br></br>  <br>Rape was pretty common back in the day</br>  She almost lost to the edge like her dad  <br> finger clicking <br>Make it stop</br></br>  <br>It's not edgy if you like it unironically.</br>  <br>Good thing that Dadruto caught that edge with his talk no jutsu and snipped it in the bud.</br>  <br>You will</br>  <br>I don't even like Naruto but Sasuke's daughter a qt</br>  <br>Does anyone have the shop where the clown instead tells a joke</br>    <br> threading your own post. </br>    <br>Define edgy</br>  <br>there's blood and death</br>  I got to say this part was pretty creepy. Loved it.  <br> Idom@ster </br>  new day, a new cat card    So nobody likes Dekoration?  Pretty kitty titty  Too bad P-chan wasnt Mayu's target, I wanted to see her have more animated scenes  <br>People do. The anons in the previous thread were just being cunts as usual.</br>  <br>It is however true that they failed completely getting any popularity.</br>  Momoka, Arisu, Nina group in the anime when?    <br> cow 79 <br>How many of her pictures do you have anon?</br></br>  Are you l@dy cake bros?<br><br>Will TakeP X Kaede canon?</br></br>    <br>Maybe he has other pictures of cows. How do you know he doesn't just really like cows?</br>  <br>A lot of people probably do, it's just Dekoration wouldn't be their favorite</br>  <br>You wouldn't a cat.</br>  <br>They are my favorite.<br><br><br>It's be a miracle even for one of them to be featured.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't mean it in a "no one has them as their favorite" kind of way, but there really shouldn't be a unit no one likes.</br>  You will never make KWSM regreat last night. <br><br>Why even produce?</br></br>  <br>Waiting for Chibiki.</br>  <br>I don't like Rosenburg Angel, Ranko should be with Love Laika</br>  <br>Because I drive to carry on thanks to the healing of an idol's smile.</br>  Kaede best l@dy  Mayu needs more love.  <br>Can't wait what is the content of that scene?</br>  I know Mayu is all about the love, but does she put out?  <br> animeonlyfag <br> watch first two episodes <br> favorite girl is   p-san <br><br>Is this normal?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't watched this but that screenshot makes my dick react. It's like I've read so many doujin with this kind of face and framing that now I'm programmed to feel hot and bothered from it. The choker doesn't help, either. <br><br>Now I need to fap, probably to a Mayu doujin. Hopefully vanilla yandere.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably, he's the only likeable character shown in the first 2 episodes as the other Project Girls are given like one 30 second line the entire episode.</br>  <br>very normal<br>he's the most popular<br> under 2 Kiritos and 2 Shirous </br></br></br>  <br>Did someone say Kaede? Can't wait :3</br>  <br>Its Kaede time?</br>  <br>   under 2 Kiritos and 2 Shirous <br><br>This triggers me more than anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Uzuki was pretty likeable.</br>    <br>Probably should have rephrased to "interesting", Uzuki is objectively among the most likeable in the main cast but she's really damn plain, but it's her schtick so I forgave her fluffy little head.</br>  Soon comrades.  <br>Not soon enough.</br>  <br><br>Can someone spoil me with Mayu's background story?  Are all the BDs out? </br></br>  <br>Broducer being a favourite is common.</br>  <br><br>Shes crazy.</br></br>  <br>I'm fed up with her Ganbarimasu</br>  <br>From doujins alone you can tell that. But I want to know what her tragic story is since apparently every single girl (and trap) in idolm@aster has had some serious shit happen to them.</br>  <br>This show ruined what it could have had.</br>  <br>You'll never live Ganbarimasu as much as she did.<br><br>That said, could've been great if we got cynical Uzuki at least.</br></br></br>  <br> cynical Uzuki <br>Don't talk about nonexistent things.</br></br>  <br>Not really. At most, The most tragic girl in im@s is Chihaya for her front and backstory. <br><br>Most of CG girls are pretty normal girls and it's the fans who have to make things up.<br><br>Mayu's backstory is just that one day she saw Psan during her modeling gig and fell in love. That's pretty much it.<br><br>If you want back stories and drama galore, SideM is chock full of them though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How old is Natsuki?  <br><br>So fluffy. Uzupaca the cutest.</br></br>  <br>Too old for Riina, nya</br>  <br>Chieri has quite a bit of stuff herself.<br><br>While not necessarily deadbeat, her parents are rarely there for her. More often than not, her parents are busy and are never at home.<br><br>Her fascination with Clovers? Its not an obsession with luck but rather, its because she had a very fond memory of her parents involving Clovers when she was a kid. Thus, Clovers help her feel at ease.<br><br>Because of this upbringing, Chieri easily gets lonely and has some serious abandonment anxiety issues.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like ganbarimasu Uzuki enough already but even just a few scenes of cynical Uzuki would have made a great gap.</br>      <br>I'll be there for you, Chieri.</br>  <br>cuck<br>u<br>c<br>k</br></br></br></br>    <br> not a single 17 years old idol </br>  <br>I want Natsuki to kabedon me.</br>  <br>Holy shit you're blind.</br>  <br>Nana please go</br>  <br>But you are blind indeed.</br>  <br>Rin is scary<br><br>But even so, I want to see more of it.</br></br></br>  The best idol.    <br>Best CG, even if she isn't one</br>  <br>I want to brutalize Natsuki.</br>  <br><br>I'm partial to Happy Happy as well.</br></br>  <br><br>She will always be by P's side</br></br>  <br>I already</br>  <br><br>That is not rock.</br></br>  We have the Stepmother<br><br>And the attic<br><br>Then what is the BIg Ball?<br><br>And who is the fairy Godmother</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's just too cute.</br>  <br><br>Yes she is.</br></br>  <br><br><br>it breaks my heart, but I want to see Kirari cry.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't be mean.</br></br>  <br> How I interpreted this image. <br> She suffers of giantism. <br> She need to take medicines to maintain her heart alive. <br> But she is dieing. <br><br>Am I right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>More like she's depressed because she feels like she can never get the P's love.</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/675915/f00340<wbr>f582/<br>She just kept getting ignored by the P and has always felt unloved.

No one would give a fuck about how shitty it was if it had the fanbase the size of Etotama</br></br>  Every anime /a/ likes  <br>If SAO hadn't gotten popular people would never have been regarded as anything more or less than mediocre. But the moment it got recognition if became 'one of the worst anime ever' or whatever people were saying.<br><br>It's like how people were fine with Attack On Titan or Madoka until word about them started to spread further than anime usually does, and then the board simply had no choice but to act like they were terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I guess you're right, but those kind of posts don't bother me too much because you can skim past them pretty quickly. <br><br><br>Just because this is a b8 thread, doesn't mean we can't derail it into a different discussion. I don't think my post () was overly sensitive in any way. I want this to be a place where people actually know shit about anime and can make arguments to back up their opinions as well, but that doesn't mean that if someone likes different shows from me then they should leave. Not saying that every opinion is valid, I'm just saying there's more than one valid opinion. <br><br>I'm speaking in general here, btw. SAO a shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize that for every "implying that show is good," there is someone they are replying to who thought the show was good, right? You're looking at situations where people on /a/ disagree over whether shows are good and saying "Wow, I can't believe /a/ hates all these shows."</br>  Drawfag Thread 1545<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn (embed)<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1544 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> implying <br>It was clearly about the vultured request</br></br>  Requesting Adlet as a Yuusha or a Clothe swap between Adlet and Yuuna.
