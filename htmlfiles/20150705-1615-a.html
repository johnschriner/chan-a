This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris). The orchestral score was performed by the Russian State Symphony Cinema Orchestra. Pretty neat.

But that first episode was money. Everything else sucked, but if you pretend like everything else doesn't exist, it's not a bad anime.<br><br> just keep throwing money at something and you get this: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=avf<wbr>28NLksxE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   01 <br> A Hour long <br><br>So onward we getting the usual 20 mins now</br></br></br>  Anyone planning on buying the BD when it comes out?   thumb-sucking like a baby <br>Just make a full TV series already.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Got a spare 1.5 million US dollars lying around?</br></br></br>  /av/ please<br>make it real</br>  <br>THANK YOU! It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed? The LoGH remake news got a sticky.</br>  <br>It was</br>  <br> stickying an old series getting licensed </br>  <br>Everybody saw LoGH already, who the fuck cares where it's licensed?</br>  <br>Quite the oblivious faggot you are.</br>  LWA made me realize how much anime costs to make.

Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure.

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple. We need some other rules.  :^) </br>  <br>I'm no doctor but you might have legit autism Anon</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Do you really not see that you just answered your own question?</br>  They sure put up a fun show.  <br>A lot of TTGL's episodes made /a/ go nuts.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You're not getting it. Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it.

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame.

Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old.

You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though.

Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about?

You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good.

It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it. <br><br>Well, aside from the endorsements (from Hideo Kojima etc), it started out with some well-known people as well, as Studio Kinema Citrus is mostly ex Production IG staff. <br><br>Wikipedia is telling me that Kinema Citrus also did Yuyushiki and Black Bullet, so I'm starting to understand the whole "artistic differences" spat with Creative Intelligence Arts, which was big on the whole "anti-moe" thing. <br><br>Anyway:<br>http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/2<wbr>2/under-the-dog-getting-an-anime-ki<wbr>ckstarter-back-on-track/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm enjoying it.</br>  <br>Tell me some more how much you don't care.</br>  <br> i can't find myself </br>  <br>I feel kinda sad that the artist had to draw in the shadows for Sucy.

The animation for LWA2 isn't going to break and there is no gameplay or any user input involved. We're just viewers that know the general art direction.

But yeah, she did nothing. </br>  <br>she handed out candy. And if they ever do LWA3 hope to see her doin something really important</br>  <br>But she threw candy to make the parade bystanders happy!</br>  <br>Ursula is actually the little sister of Diana's mom and a "disgrace to the family. The Cavendish family is the most reputable family in the old guard of witches but they have a very "witches-are-superior-to-muggles" ideology and believe witches should be feared. Ursula disagreed and ran away from home. Diana really loved her aunt and went to every event. The guy with Diana in the intro scene of LWA is her butler. One day Shiny Chariot's show stopped without warning because something happened that killed the Shiny Rod's power. The third movie will be parent's visit day and it will deal with this backstory.</br>  <br>i want to believe!</br>  <br>A common mexican name.</br>  If I'm a backer, where can I watch this without torrenting?<br><br>Haven't gotten any emails nor am I seeing anything on the Kickstarter site.</br></br>  <br>ok premise if they had a tv show</br>  Holy shit Akko almost made this unbearable to watch.

I want to bury my face in Sucy's butt though her dress.

SHINY!!! ARCA!!!</br>  <br>That has to be an edit.<br>Don't tease my penis like that.</br></br>  <br>she was adorable</br>  <br>That image was Trigger backpedaling. When you watch the first episode it becomes clear that the dresses are not designed that way.</br>  <br>It's not. You can actually see her bare butt in the episode if you happen to pause it at just the right moment.</br>  <br>Exactly when?</br>  <br>Sensory overload. <br>The wand represents my penis.</br></br>  I just naturally assumed that their school uniforms have some sort of censorship enchantment on them to prevent upskirts and panty shots  <br>A Little Witch Academia without "The Void" it's simply not Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>33:55<br><br>It's near the start of the parade, when Akko is dancing with the brooms.</br></br></br>  <br>That image is fanart.</br>      <br>Literally everyone leaves to go jerk off to Akko's ass. <br><br>Wasn't it from the trigger art book?</br></br></br>  Will Akko ever find out Ursula-sensei is her beloved Shiny Chariot?  Will they have sex?   <br>Akko is a lewd girl that likes to flaunt her booty around.</br>  <br>I bet the third movie will be about Shiny Chariot's backstory and Akko and Diana will finally see eye-to-eye in something.</br>  does anyone have a pic of the scene where Amanda does the broom dance and you can can briefly see her ass? Also, I hope this is popular enough to get made into a series    Was there color turn arounds for all the characters?<br>I need references badly.</br>  Is it me or is Diana kinda obsessed with Akko?  <br>if you look carefully, it becomes obvious that she is wearing panties</br>  <br>its you</br>  <br>Excuse the quality face.</br>  We need a TV series of this so we have more material to scour for loli witch asses.  Is Diana still voiced by the girl who voices Rias Gremory?  Best fucking $110 I ever spent. Thank you based Trigger.  Oh God, I'm super-duper excited and really want to watch it right now, but I'm dead tired.  So this isn't the BDs?    <br>is you</br>  if they are not going to do another kickstarter will they at least sell merch so I can throw money at them that way?  <br>ESPURR!<br>She reminds me of an Espurr. God, it's been bugging me since I watched it.</br></br>    <br>never ceases to amuse me</br>  <br>Yes, Yoko Hikasa.</br>  <br>Yeah, I would really love some LWA merch. I already bought the LWA1 BD off of Trigger's store, but it's not enough.</br>      Nendroid Petite LWA pack with Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Amanda, Constanze and secret Yasumineka.  <br>BEST</br>    <br>I want it!</br>      <br>Thanks nigga.</br>  <br>I want it. I want GSC to make some LWA nendos.</br>      Akko was kind of bitchy in part 2 but it's okay to have a bad day sometimes. <br>I still love you, girl.</br>    <br> that iMac on the left </br>  <br>That does make sense, as much as I don't like petites.<br><br>Gimme a Sucy scale with mushroom base.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't that bad. She got a little grating when she was being selfish about the whole parade, but she's a teenage girl and she's passionate. It happens.</br>  i want to have a ride on sensei's shiny chariot  <br>I still think they could have toned her down a bit</br>  <br>This. In the first half, it seemed almost out of character (compared to the first installment).</br>  The last moments of the episode just screamed Ooshima Michiru's work, so I wasn't surprised when I saw her name on the credits. Based Michiru, making the best soundtracks ever since SnW.   tfw I almost backed the kickstarter but an anon convinced me not to, because the business model was bad for the animation industry or something <br><br>Why was I so stupid</br></br>  <br>the one that did that folk music?</br>  <br>I wasn't able to back it because I had no money at the time. I would have gladly thrown dosh at the kickstarter for all the cool stuff if I had been able to.<br><br>Guess I'll just wait for the BD to be put up for sale.</br></br></br>  <br>Why was it stupid?<br>You got it for free.</br></br>  <br> folk music <br>What? All I know from Ooshima are these big orchestral stuff like you hear in Sora no Woto or LWA.</br></br>  <br>so what percentage of that outfit is life fibers</br>  The cutest witch.  I'm watching Enchanted parade right now. This stuff is Studio Ghibli tier in terms of story telling and near studio Ghibli tier in terms of animation.  <br>I want her to teach me how to dance.</br>  <br>So it's a convoluted mess that looks pretty?</br>  So, if they do a Kickstarter for Little Witch Academia 3, would you donate?<br><br>Assuming similar stretch goals and reward tiers, how much would you donate next time compared to what you donated this time?</br></br>  <br>She did apologize.</br>  <br>I would donate about $50</br>  <br>that fucking gif</br>  <br>I wouldn't go so far in terms of story telling, but I love the art style and it's very refreshing. Characters are also very varied and powerful. I was pleasantly surprised with everything in general. Would donate again for sure.</br>  I want her to tie me down with magic while she   insults my dick and then proceeds to rape me   Was it worth the money you put in?  <br>now that i have some money i will donate!!</br>  <br>Exceeded my expectations. <br>they should have focused on doing a series out of that instead of doing kill la kill imo. This has great potential to become a great series. A shame.</br></br>  I didn't know about this till today, the sticky made me curious and well, it was pretty good, even being that short the story and his little world envelops you, you really care for the characters even when you barely know them, I had a really good time. Is there going to be a full series about it? I would like to see that, all this have lots of potential for more.<br> Sucy best girl! </br>  <br><br><br>I was half reminded of Flash Dance with her routine and was expecting a bucket of water to be dumped on her at the end.</br></br></br>  <br>My nigro.<br>Sucy and Amanda, best girls by far.</br></br>  <br><br>My brothers!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br>I know that Luna means moon in latin, but what is Lana supposed to mean?

Speaking as an artist. </br>  <br>I have faith about they'll make a full serie of this.<br>It was said two or three days ago that Trigger anounced a new anime original, maybe it's LWA.<br>Even if they don't make it we'll still have the Inferno Cop X LWA.</br></br></br>  <br>Lana is wool in italian and spanish, but I doubt it has any relation to it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br> not wanting Sucy's upside-down isosceles triangle body </br>  <br>Same here bro. I didn't know about this series until today either and i was completely drawn in.</br>  <br>Probably enough to get my name in the credits.</br>  <br> Yoshinari will never do a spinoff for his favorite LWA, Diana <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised there were people that haven't seen this yet.</br>  <br>That would be the best news in years. It has enough elements to become a very rich series with lots of stories. It could become an improved version of Shitty Potter.</br>  <br>good post<br><br><br>i commend</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mah niggas</br></br></br>  Trigger said that they're working on 3 original things; the next original TV series (some sort of serious-looking show that has Persona-like character designs) a shorter thing for USPTime and another original that is farther on. Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 but for now fixes and retakes for the BD and theatrical release.  My personal ranking:<br><br>Sucy = Amanda &gt; Diana &gt; Akko &gt; the rest</br></br>  <br>It was everything I wanted, but even better than I expected it. Well worth it. Looking forward to the BD and the tons of extras I get with it even more now.</br>  <br>Amanda stole my heart, but that's not particularly dangerous.</br>  <br>She would be part of the main story in a third sequel; this movie set-up the seeds for her and Akko finally teaming up.</br>    <br>I'd rather draw Sucy  or lotte </br>  WIPs.<br>http://i.imgur.com/A7q6j16.png<br>http://i.imgur.com/AjoNZv3.png<br><br>Maybe do more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 <br>Really? I thought he wasn't too jazzed about LWA. IIRC he wanted to do a psychological drama thing.</br></br>  <br>He said it's still not the perfect LWA for him.</br>  <br> lewds of the LWAs <br>For what purpose</br></br>    <br>Doing God's work. Needs more Amanda and overall broom action.</br>  <br><br>Well, if LWA 3 is the Parent's Day it could have all the drama he'd want.</br></br>  <br> More Constance please. </br>  <br>Will /a/ save anime again with LWA3?</br>  <br>Funded in 3 hours or less this time.</br>  <br>Would be funny if the anime industry's western-like studios caught up with Kickstarter's possibilities by watching LWA and started competing for attention with great projects.

Trigger's track record isn't bad (KLK was a massive hit, Inou Battle was lukewarm, Ninja Slayer is a meme show on Niconico) but LWA is under most elevens' radar, so they'll have to depend on the West again if they decide to do more.</br></br>  <br>I think she  grew up .</br>  Anyone else like how Sucy is drawn without arms until she uses them for something  <br>Oh shit, you're right.</br>  <br>I really appreciate you namefagging, it's much easier to hit the button every time.<br><br><br>She matured.

Erwin knows a lot and he seems to have many connections, so I'm sure he must have seen Keith with Grisha at one point, right?<br><br>Also, I wonder if his dream has something to do with what could be in the basement, what with that suspicious look Zacklay through at him last chapter.</br></br>  Keith and Grisha are Ymir's people. They are infiltrates.  <br> spinoff <br>Nobody cares. But I'm certain Keith must have some extra info on Erwin we didn't know about. Remember the ACWNR isn't canon, so it's possible Isayama even retcons it.</br></br>  <br>Keith should had only retired after wall maria fell. So it is highly likely erwin was with keith on that day.</br>  <br> so it's possible Isayama even retcons it <br>I doubt it. There would be no reason for Isayama to approve of that shitty spinoff thrice, if he was only going to change the story and waste panels on it.<br><br><br>That's what I'm saying. Hopefully some answers this chapter and nothing too superfluous.</br></br></br></br></br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>I love Annie more than anything in this world<br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we will be in the walls for at least one volume.

Who the fuck is this "stiler"? It's just Anniebot as usual.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't quote me on this, but apparently on that cover Isayama did of Levi for Frau magazine, Armin was originally sitting on his lap with his head against Levi's, looking at the magazine. But Bessatsu and Frau wanted him to change it to just Levi.<br><br>Yay, pedophilia?</br></br></br>  <br>Please drop the metafagging, I am not plain-dude and I have no idea who Stiler is.</br>  <br>then he is plain-dude chan. beside we known he/she been a annie fan longer then stiller. Plus stiller actually can defend why he likes annies. It is still dumb but it make sense in a twisted way.</br>  <br>[citation neded]</br>  <br><br>He's a mod from the subreddit who cums over Annie's paps every day, every night, and in every dream he has.</br></br>  <br>Why?

The LM cover originally had Armin in Levi's lap. It was the WIP Isayama posted on his blog. Bessastsu edited Armin by the time it was published.</br>  <br><br>No, I don't. And why, what could I have possibly done to warrant that response? <br><br>(I highly doubt you can find my blog via that image, but just in case you can, don't.)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sauce please. Preferably, a link to the post on Isayama's blog.</br></br>  <br>Ok Jumping Giant.</br>  <br>No, the sketch Isayama posted in his blog only had Armin's head floating around like it wasn't meant to be there.

Despite feeling overwhelmed by Jack's presence, Yuya persists on with his ideal of an Entertainment Duel...!<br><br>Summary:<br>As proof that they have came to form alliances with the City Council, the Lancers have to participate in the Friendship Cup under Reiji's proposal. Furthermore, Yuya is compelled to duel in an Exhibition Match during the previous night of the tournament, and his opponent is the Duel King - Jack Atlas...! In a stadium completely filled with the high tensions of the audience, Yuya feels overwhelmed by Jack's presence, but he persists on with his ideal of an Entertainment Duel...!<br><br>Cast List:<br>Sakaki Yuya<br>Yuugo<br>Hiiragi Yuzu/Serena<br>Gongenzaka Noboru<br>Sawatari Shingo<br>Crow Hogan<br>Narrator<br>Akaba Reiji<br>JACK ATLAS<br>Jean Michel Roger<br>City Council President, White Taki<br>Gale<br>Azul<br>Grey<br>Bolt<br>Melissa Claire<br>Sam<br>Assorted Voices<br><br>Screenwriter: Kamishiro Tsutomu<br><br>Who's ready for crushed EGAO and Yuya getting his ass kicked?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 10+ inches long <br> 5 inches around </br></br>  <br>Aww shucks, too bad its fake</br>  <br> Gale <br> Azul <br> Grey <br> Bolt <br> Sam <br>Who?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beyond ready, Jack had better send Yuuya back to the stone age <br>Wait so Shun and Dennis aren't going to be present for this destruction?</br></br>  <br>I think it's just the voices cast, maybe they're only spectator.</br>  <br>I am ready for WAGA TAMASHI.</br>  <br>Here's the other four protags for reference.</br>  <br>We all know Jack will win; Konami hasn't got the BALLS to reintroduce an old star and hand them an unwelcome loss, lest the 5dsfags shoot their chips.<br>But if Yuya pulls out all the stops and wins this, damn, this series is something else. I'll be rooting for him regardless.</br></br>  <br>But Kaito is in a different dimension.</br>  <br> The Passionate Miserable Kitty <br> Ability: 0% <br>Unless its Yuzu of course then it jumps to 100% ability</br></br></br>   think browsing /a/ will be fun <br> it's just a fuckton of spoilers <br>gross</br></br>  <br>It depends. On one hand, they want to shill 5ds memorabilia. On the other, they want to shill Pendulums. <br>Old versus new, but money still rules.</br></br>  <br> Tumblr gifs </br>  <br> tumblr <br> 250x141 <br><br>How horrifying.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What's wrong with that?</br></br>  <br>What about the four Yus?</br>  <br> the special passionate fighter <br>nice</br></br>  <br> The Special Passionate Fighter <br>I guess it goes hand in hand with this</br></br>  <br>XYZ WINS AGAIN LOL</br>  <br>Oh, well that only confirms the program is full of shit.<br>If Shun were any more hetero the planet would rupture.</br></br>  <br>Not in a L1T meta, and specially not if those insecure Nekroz leave their Djinn-lock bearer in DEF.</br>  How would you tell him?  <br> card game </br>  <br>Some banana haired boy from Sing Crow land half killed your best friend but then your friend somehow got sucked up into some other dude who craves his women about half as much as you do. Your friend is now a spirit guide, kinda like they did in two previous Yugioh series except for some reason he doesn't do shit. He likes to talk about smiles though.</br>  <br>Shun remember when you said you would beat Yuto if he got in your way? Good news.</br>   Yuto isn't aware Yugo isn't evil <br> He contacts Shun through spooky ghost powers and tells him what he did <br> Shun seeks revenge for him <br> Duels Yugo and fucks him up <br> Yuya appears <br> Tries to explain Yugo isn't evil and it's just a misunderstanding  <br> Absorbs Yugo </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuto could have lived and had another ally if he pronounced Yuugo's name correctly </br>  I'am surprised they are waging on only 3 elites to handle Neo New Sawatari Underworld troupe deck, still is unlikely they can beat him as long he gets his pendulum cards turn 1 since we all know pendulum summoning is THE BEST.    Jesus that Gusto doujin.  Tell me anon why does she wanna be DA PERFECT  <br>I just realized Yuto is the Atem, Winged Kuriboh/Yubel, etc. of Arc-V.<br><br>Well I'm stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Well let's see what Sawatari amd his Underworld Troupe has accomplished so far.<br>In episode 48 he removed a monster and damaged somebody by 500 points, but that only resulted in a trap happening that only brought the monster back and damaged him and his partners even more.<br>In episode 56 he just straight up lost by means so prompt and so embarrassing it wasn't worth going into details over, and in Episode 62 he managed to put a monster on a boat.<br><br>I'm starting to think Sawatari really is a joke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kinda wish he was, because giving an hourly reminder to smile doesn't really compare to Atem/Astral/etc.</br>  <br>Will Underworld Troupe get released in Breaker of Shadows? (I hope the set code either BROS or BOSS)<br>More importantly, will we finally get Moonlights?</br></br>    <br>Different Dimension Dicking</br>  <br>I want this one.<br>Though I'm not sure if there are many worthwhile level 11 monsters that can be freely special summoned.</br></br>  <br> THE MAN Gongenzaka sets the best possible scales <br>Now THAT'S alpha.</br></br>  <br>The Pendulum statues are never gonna get released.<br>It would be interesting if Yuzu's bracelet recontract universe'd her pendulums into being Melodious support</br></br>  <br>Name?</br>  <br>Well he's definitely Winged Kuriboh, his weird noises are smiles.</br>   Break out your Elemental Hero deck and get ready to duel!

But choosing Yuma's VA? Fucking really?<br><br>I'm sorry, I don't have any choice but to dropped Ushio to Tora.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope<br>I wish I could give Yuya a hug, he's gonna get rekt beyond belief</br></br>  <br>Yuya will eclipse Judai in the end.<br><br>I mean, seriously, this arc ends in literally anything but Yuya and Yuzu being reunited.<br><br>Yuzu gets sent off to prison, Yuzu gets kidnapped by Yuri, Slifer Red invades and Yuzu ends up with them through a wacky MISUNDERSTANDING, Yugo and Yuya go full DRAGON, Reiji acts like a dick, Bennis goes Ballistic...<br><br>Bad end city.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuya impregnating Yuzu when? <br><br><br>Nope.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I really doubt this would happen. If it was Yugo though, he could maybe beat King.</br></br>  <br>No, she doesn't. Seeing Yuya duel KINGU will probably kick her ass into first gear.</br>  Can't remember, was it ever explained how Yuto and Shun were able to get to the standard dimension?  <br>Willpower</br>  <br><br><br>Why are you so sure about that?

At this rate he's gonna cry about Yuzu to Jack.</br>  <br> Jack walks up and punches him <br>Oh god I'd be heartbroken and laughing my ass off at the same time</br></br>  <br> Scarright Dragon! Direct attac... Why are you crying? <br> Yu.. Yuzu used to clobber me with her crude strong arms as well! </br></br>  <br>You realize crunchy subs are uploaded to nyaa right?</br>  <br>Anyone have this in something better than 2 frames per hour?</br>  <br>In the form of HorribleSubs, yes. Still doesn't justify streaming.</br>  <br>But you're not streaming. You are downloading their subs and watching them.</br>  <br>Nobody said anything about sub quality</br>  <br>But I am bashing streaming, not downloading. Are you missing something here?</br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Still doesn't justify streaming  <br><br>What's the difference? You are still watching the same subs. Why is downloading the subs and then watching them on your computer instead of simply watching the exact same subs online seen as a superior complex?</br></br></br>  <br>Why not? Crunchyroll releases a sub 1 hour after it broadcasts in Japan and it's in HD.</br>  <br>I never thought Yuma's VA was that bad. Not super great, but he uses a lower pitch for Ushio than Yuma if that makes anything better. I just thought it was a funny coincidence. <br><br>First episode of the show was pretty good overall, too. It's a little like what Kotori and Yuma's dynamic might have looked like if there was a little more effort put into it, even though it's the typical 'tsun girl calls main guy a baka' sort of thing.</br></br></br>  <br> oooh watcha say </br>  5Ds manga guy here. Anybody want me to start working on uploading Volume 2? I would have had it up sooner, but I had to move some stuff around and need an electrician to continue scanning.  <br>Cause it's not a superior complex. There are multiple advantages over streaming by downloading.<br><br><br>Only for paying users.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No watermarks from shitty streaming sites <br> Can use hardware acceleration to improve quality  <br> Can watch the episode without an internet connection. <br>Not that guy but the difference is clear.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Only for paying users <br><br>Of course. The fact that you shun streaming yet you download the subs that came from the stream sites is hypocrisy.</br></br></br>  <br>We are talking about streaming. Not subtitle quality.</br>  <br> Can watch the episode without an internet connection. <br>You need an internet connection to download the episode<br><br>And we are talking about Crunchy, who don't have watermarks and only require you to pay an INCREDIBLY small fee which is justified.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crunchyroll is a streaming site.</br>  <br>No shit. What's your point?</br>  <br>But I don't actually use HS.</br>    <br> Will we ever see him laugh? <br><br>One day, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I download FFF. Checkmate atheists.</br>  <br>Serena of all time and forever<br>Reiji<br>Clear Wing<br>Shun vs. Sora 1, Reiji vs. Yuya 2, Sawatari vs. Yuya 2, I'll give the edge to Shun vs. Sora 1<br>DDD<br>YUGO JA NE or the constant &gt;Yuzu gonna snap at Yuya or &gt;Shun will never be happy is gonna get carded</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel bad that Yuya is going to get beat down by the King, but I feel good that Yuzu is finally going to know that Yuya is in Synchro.  <br>Yuya pls leave</br>   people actually defending streaming <br>what has the world gone to.<br> i hope you stream retards dont think that you arent downloading anything by streaming. have you cleaned your cache folder today? </br></br>  <br>Yuya pls marry me</br>  <br>You just said we aren't talking about subtitle quality. We are talking about streaming, and I said Crunchyroll is a site for streaming. Say you insult somebody for streaming GX's or 5D's crunchy subs but then you still download the crunchy subs via HorribleSubs on nyaa. That's hypocrisy. <br><br>Downloading Crunchy's subs yet bashing someone who rather watch the same subs online makes you sound like a dumbass<br><br>If someone rather watch the exact same episode with the exact same subs online than doing what you do and download the subs and watch them on your own time, then that's fine. They could use that time that you would spend downloading the episode, watching it online.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Yugo gets sad that Yuzu leaves him <br> tfw it triggers him the same way Rin 'left' </br></br>  Could Jack beat Serious Gil?  <br> Yugo getting jelly <br>Probably going to happen. NTR-V is real.</br></br>  <br>None of that fee goes to the original staff. Streaming is never the answer, you're just trying to justify wasted money.</br>  is shun the batman of arc v?  <br>Batman doesn't attack innocent people.</br>  <br>Well, I'm just happy Yugo and Yuzu will have actually things to do now.<br><br>Even if it is a retarded tournament arc.</br></br></br>  <br>RIP nameless LDS employees who were lost to the wind forever. At least Marco-sensei and Hokuto are sitting safely in a drawer somewhere.</br>  <br>Not that anon but downloading the episodes or subs online is just as bad. Just as bad as people downloading music online.</br>   Shun finally meets up with Ruri <br> She doesn't recognize him <br> Leo used the same brainwashing technique that Reiji did against Masumi and friends <br> Acts like Sora has been her ally from the start </br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> Yuzu snap at Yuya <br>That would never happen.<br><br>What could happen is Edge Yuya accidentally hurting Yuzu, as the same thing was hinted to happen with Yuto and Ruri, but even then I don't think Yuzu would snap at Yuya.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure if he hugs and kisses her, the memories will come rushing back.</br>  <br>She's your sister, Shun.</br>  <br>When I say streaming, I mean the actual video quality, the framerate, the resolution. Not some fucking words on a screen. In fact, you are making yourself look like a retard for not getting the point after all this time. <br><br>Also, people download HF subs because there is no faster and consistent subbing group substitute. Take the time when SNAFU was airing. CommieSubs churned their episodes out a full day earlier than any other subbing group. Their episodes were watched more than HorribleSubs and even got Nyaa's blue seal of approval.</br></br></br>  <br>No, Reiji is. Reiji has a NEET cave, a boy sidekick, overwhelming power, prep time, and keikkaku. All Shun has is acrobatics, gadgets, and fights. <br><br>Shun is like Nightwing, the first of Reiji's pupils grown up. Sawatari was the next to enter the cave, he's the second Robin, I forget his name because he sucks and unfortunately so does Sawatari right now, Reira is the next boy wonder.</br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't hug and kiss his sister </br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>Will this ever be available for download though? I still don't think there is a rip of Crunchy's 5D's subs. <br><br>Chances are good that these subs will be the far superior subs for GX though.</br></br></br>  <br>cards that are available in standard polyimerization was a card in the first anime</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4827753  <br> allowing people to votebot </br>  <br>The subs for GX are fine though as long as your'e not using gx_st. I believe there was an anon taking the better subs and throwing them over the DVD rips.</br>  <br> Sawatari was the next to enter the cave, he's the second Robin, I forget his name because he sucks and unfortunately so does Sawatari right now <br><br>You mean Tim Drake?</br></br></br>  <br>Someone on NAC is ripping the crunchy subs for 5D's and an anon recently fitted dvd raws of GX with GLL99's subs  https://mega.co.nz/#F!UZEESKjB!8XT8<wbr>uUu5_j9k57Jyvdz34Q</wbr> </br>  <br> I believe there was an anon taking the better subs and throwing them over the DVD rips <br>There was, and he finished, subs are pretty great</br></br>  <br>I guess, I don't remember the Robins other than Nightwing.</br>  <br>He was the third, second died.</br>  <br>Jason Todd.</br>  <br>Oh sorry, then it was Jason Todd.</br>   Sawatarifags still salty <br>My favorite characters are Yuzu and Yugo, and they've been off-screen putting up posters for the last month. At least your boy got screentime.</br>  <br>YUZU PUTTING UP POSTERS? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP FOR THAT EPISODE KAMISHIRO-SAMA</br>  <br>Oh that's good news that he finished. Is it up on nyaa or what? I'm interested in checking out an episode or two to see how he did.</br>  Is it just me or does it make Arc-v a little more likable when Yuya‚Äôs mostly treated as another member of the group like all the others or the voice of reason, rather than being the leader with people clinging to his heels, and we all know how the latter situation ended up for most of the protagonist. They even have the main rival being the leader.  <br>Ebina pls</br>    <br>It was a mega folder, you should be able to find it in the archive, the name he used was something along the lines of GX subber Anon</br>  <br>see</br>  <br><br>It`s here<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>One of my favorite things about Arc-V. It feels more like an ensemble with a focus on one certain character than it does "14 year old's quest to become Card Jesus"</br>  <br>I remember seeing this way back, and thinking "of course I fucking would, and I'd download a house to go along with it".</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anons, I completely missed that post.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh. This arc has been the Yuya and Shun show, with Selena, Gon, and Sawatari starring as glorified meatfields and/or distractions.</br>  <br>My dreams of the Yugo and Yuzu show have been crushed. But at least we're diving right into the Friendship Cup, and with a name like what could possibly go wrong?</br>  <br>Hey at least Sawatari got a piece of Serena multiple times. Why do you think she had to duel so much? It was like her after sex cigarette.</br>  <br>Sawatari pls</br>  <br>Shingo, your delusions are starting to get out of control.</br>  <br>(Ko)Tori's dub voice actress was the same as dub Iris in Pokemon BW.<br>Annoying main girl in both big "kiddie" animu of 2011-2013. How pitiful.</br></br>  <br>Please what? Want me to get my father to pull a few strings for you?</br>  <br>When you download an episode from a fansub group you are directly supporting them. Do you think they do this for free?</br>    <br>Why does nobody believe me, why else would she be sent to her own special cell away from me? I'm too handsome for her to resist.</br>  So according to summaries, Yuya and Pals DON'T escape from Prison, but Reiji strikes up a deal with Jean Michel.<br><br>As a show of good will, the Lancers are entering the Friendship Cup.<br><br>We all know Reiji is going to stab Jean Michel in the back and say "Checkmate" or "PERSONALLY I PREFER CARD GAMES", but for now he and the Lancers are on the side of the oppressive regime. <br><br>Sasuga, Akaba.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like Reiji made a bet with him that if even one of his Lancers win the friendship cup and beats Jack they'll ally with him against Fusion and all crimes pardoned.</br>  So Jack is for sure staying along right? I don't see how Reiji would pass up taking him along unless Jack literally tells him to suck his dick for him to go along.<br> And even then </br>  <br>God I hope not.</br>  <br>Could be some Dragon Age bullshit where Jack will join for the final battle.<br><br>Honestly that will be for the best, because Gundam Seed Destiny style plot will kill development for everyone who isn't Shun</br></br></br>  <br>Yuzu pls contain your raging girl boner for Yuya pls and go shill some new Melodious/Fantasia tunas and synchros so you can powa up your tomato husbando's deck with solitaire powa for his inevitable rematch against KINGU.</br>  <br> Tfw no cute baka blonde dream boy to cuddle </br>  <br> Yuzu pls contain your raging girl boner for Yuya  <br>This is harder to do than you realize Reiji</br></br>  <br>Suffering isn't it Serena?</br>  <br>Though to be fair, Yuya has created or possesses 3 waifu cards in the anime, 4 if you count Master of Pendulum and Noble/Superior Dragon Magician who is the most usable of the Yuzu waifu cards out of her, Trump Witch, Helprincess, and Creation/Synthesis Magician. How many more Yuzu waifu cards will he create before the end of ARC-V?</br>  <br>What is it with hungry Serena and why do they fanartists portray her like that?</br>  Is Arc-V the first yugioh series not to have an awful second season since the original?  <br>Until his entire deck is Yuzu.wav.</br>  <br>The entire first two episodes of Synchro were all about Yugo and showing how great at riding duels he is</br>  <br>Serena has a literal waifu deck though</br>  <br>Because her being a spoiled princess and just wanting snacks is adorable.</br>  <br>Eh, Synchro started good but it got pretty shitty after the first City episode</br>  <br>Serena is actually a Hungry Burger card</br>  <br>Depends on who you ask. Despite only being ~10 episodes, people will declare Synchro to be gutter trash. Personally I don't really have any major issues to pick with it so far.</br>  <br>So far that seems to be the case</br>  <br>So, if Shun is the new Yusei and Crow, will he be the one to beat Jack and re-ignite his Burning Soul?</br>  <br>I'm not a huge fan of Synchro, but I'm sure the Friendship Cup will be hype.</br>  <br>Shun is the new Crow. Yugo is the new Yusei. Jack is the glorious KINGU.</br>  <br>I'd much rather have something like Yugo vs Yuya be the 'big duel' at the end of FC and see more about what's up with the summoning method dragons than a Jack rematch.</br>  <br>We'll find out now that we're out of boring Prison.<br><br>Then again, I'm a simple man. I just want some Yuzu episodes and for my nigga Sawatari to get past the first round.</br></br></br>  <br>The first two episodes with Reiji VS Yuya were great<br><br>Then it got pretty shitty when Yuya VS Yoko was made into a two parter and it was literally a 3-turn flashback duel<br><br>Things looked like it would get great with the Yuzu and Yugo episode but the Riding Duel episode probably turned a lot of people off, including me<br><br>The Lancers VS Security episode was really shit<br><br>The Dennis VS Gongenzaka and Dennis VS Shun Riding Duel episodes were great<br><br>Then the Crow VS Yuya episode was really stupid<br><br>The first Prison episode was also pretty shit<br><br>Yuya VS Tokumatsu was okay but it didn't really deserve a semi-2-parter<br><br>The entertainment duel tournament episode was actually pretty great, best episode in a while<br><br>The next episode looks good but I'm positive Yuya VS Jack will be the highlight of this season<br><br>So far, it's been a rollercoaster just like the beginning of the Season 1 Arc-V</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yugo/Yuya will be highlight if it happens.</br>  <br>Sasuga Neo New Man</br>  <br>People didn't like the riding duel episode? I was happy to see more Yugo dueling and I found the whole goyo guardian thing to be a very nice touch.</br>  <br> Dennis VS Shun Riding Duel episodes were great <br><br> 3000 LP penalty because Shun is just that amazing <br> interrupted ending <br> Shun writing off Dennis as a total scrub until it turns out he isn't, which we already know <br><br>For me the mini prison arc and Gon vs Dennis were the most enjoyable parts, only counting the part of the show that takes place in Synchro world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sawatari. <br> Getting past round 1. <br><br>Besides that I wonder how large the Friendship Cup contestant count is. As big as the Maiami Championship or as small as the Fortune Cup.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dennis only managed to do 900 points of damage to Shun's 3900 </br>  <br>Probably on the smaller side. Just the Lancers, Yugo, Yuzu, and a bunch of dudes probably working for Jean anyway to arrest Yugo/Yuzu.</br>  <br>Apparently it was still enough to have Shun wonder if he could really be from LDS, since he's not abhorrent at dueling</br>  <br>Hopefully we get some entertaining side characters out of it.  ;_; </br>  <br>Yes, the NTR is delicious.</br>  <br>It's probably because people didn't like how Yuzu was written there. Neither did I.<br><br>Although I did kinda enjoy the Riding Duel, just not how Yuzu was portrayed.<br><br><br>Notice how every episode you labeled as bad or meh when things are finally in the Synchro Dimension were actually written by the same guy, save for the Lancers vs Security episode.<br><br>Then again, he looks like the guy who's assigned for filler episodes rather than anything story-related. Got a feeling though that he'll be writing Jack vs Yuya, considering how they're rotating writing episodes since Synchro Dimension started.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DELETE THIS PICTURE</br>  <br>I'm guessing Gale, Azul, Gret, Bolt, and Sam are contestants <br><br>All the Lancers are joining so that's already 6 duelists, 9 if you count Reiji, Reira, and Tsukikage<br><br>Then you have Crow, Shinji, Damon, and Tokumatsu which makes 10 contestants already. As well as Yuzu and Yugo which puts it at 12, 15 if you count Reiji, Reira, and Tsukikage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah i'm gonna need the full image.</br>  <br>Well, that guy is literally the guy who wrote the Quiz Bowl duel. He sucks.</br>  <br> messing with Yuuya's Citrus <br>I hope Jack wipes the floor with you after he finishes with Tomato, Fusionman</br></br>  <br>Yugo going straight to the top. Until he tries to take Serena too and Reiji loses his shit.</br>  <br>If they go full Fortune Cup levels, most of the random assholes will be boring (I only remember the knight guy that Aki raped), but we might get a Bommer tier character out of it.</br>  <br>Sure thing, Fusion</br>  <br>Quiz duel was really bad, but at the same time Yuya vs Sawatari II, and vs Chojiro I thought were among the better examples of a lower stakes duel still being enjoyable without a ton of drama or lives on the line.</br>  <br>Creepy Saa guy that fought against Ruka was the only one that was truly bad, the rest was fine</br>  <br>At least Kamishiro is going to do Yuya vs Jack, so this will be a PLOT episode. Ebina animates the Shun and Ruris episodes.</br>  your all niggers  <br>I agree, especially at this time of the week.</br>  Yuuya fan service when?<br><br>No</br></br>  What is this expression trying to convey?  <br> Best girl <br>Selena<br> Best boy <br>Shun<br> Best card <br>REVOLUTION FALCON<br> Best duel <br>Sora vs Shun I<br> Best soundtrack <br>Yugo's theme<br> Best meme <br>RURI</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Best Girl <br>Yuzu<br> Best Boy <br>Rule 63 Yuzu<br> Best card <br>Toss-up between Creation Magician, Trump Witch, and Beast Eyes<br> Best duel <br>Yuzu vs m-, Yuya<br> Best soundtrack <br>OST 3 track 12<br> Best meme <br>That joke about Yuzu not getting back with Yuya, hahahaha, it's funny, because it's not going to happen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Synchro would be much better if it was how the social structure of 5D's was explored with some plot. Seriously that was the most interesting thing about 5D's was the social darwisim. How do those in the City feel about Satellite residents coming in? How are people from Satellite doing? From that one episode we got exploring that notion was that they were being targeted by a lone shark that was taking advantage of them.<br><br>Other things like education for school age children and how they are integrated in scools arcoss Neo Domino. Then the businesses as well, what's their stance on getting Satellite scum as trash. And what about Crow with his little home delivery service? I'm sure small companies who want to be cheep and hire Crow would be alright but what about the people he make deliveries to? I'm sure there is some social stigma and discrimination people markers face daily.<br><br>Atleast Arc-V shows that Security not only antagonize innocent people from the Commons but also arrest them for no damn reason. Plus there is the rich keeping them down so they won't rise up and see them as diseased rats. Those like Jack climbed up to the top maybe living a better life but are possibly human pets for that proform fir the Tops entertainment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Beast Eyes <br> not Rune Eyes </br></br>  <br>He's telling them to oil up.</br>   tfw despite all Lancers, except Reiji's group, are participating in the Friendship Cup, the only ones who are getting full on-screen duels are Yuya, Shun, Bennis and somewhat Gon. <br><br>At least Sawatari gets new cards every time he shows them off despite not having any full duels. Serena repeats the exact same thing.<br><br>At this rate, I wished she was just taken back to Academia when the Obelisk Force attacked.<br><br>Ninja and Reira are okay though since they're part of Reiji's group. They're inevitably going to be used for Reiji's development anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Serena is so good she can go undefeated by using 3-4 cards</br>  <br>You know that'll backfire soon enough once she gets her next on-screen duel, right? If she ever gets any that is.</br>  <br>it kinda already backfired with jobelisk force maindecking fusion hate.<br><br>She just not learning the use of different startegies like sawatari-san</br></br></br>  <br> She just not learning the use of different startegies like sawatari-san <br>Sawatari stop trying to post in English when you're Japanese, you can't grammar very well.</br></br>  <br>Oh god<br><br>Oh god they're going to have Selena duel Yuzu, aren't they?<br><br>Please no. Please, anyone but Yuzu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You act like that would be a bad thing.</br>    <br>Oh damn <br>This cup is playing with my heart</br></br>  I think it's impossible for Yuya to win against Jack unless he can make something higher than 3k attack  <br>Implying grammar is a barrier to our pendulum pioneer Sawatari-sama</br>  <br>Yuzu is custom built for suffering.</br>  <br> you will never wake Reiji up by pushing his glasses onto his face </br>  <br> Yuzu wins <br> Fun duel, right Selena? <br> ...Selena? </br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it will definitely be animated by Ebina.</br>  <br>I think they're saving the Yuzu vore for later.</br>  <br>D-defusion will save us</br>  <br>I think I've realized why Leo is capturing Ruris and was isolating Serena. He knows Serena is completely devoted to him (at the time), and if the Ruris act like the Yuyas, they're under Highlander rules. Rin and Ruri were both captured, and more than likely they were forced to duel, with one of them being eaten. That left Yuzu to be captured, forced to duel the winner, and then the winner of that had to duel the strongest Ruri, which is Serena, who would then have taken all three to become the "key" for whatever Leo is plotting.</br>  <br>True, but remember, Yugo defeated Yuto, yet Yuto was the one who fused with Yuya. <br><br>Fucking hax Pendant.</br></br></br>  <br>MC Highlander gets special rules, like how McCleod wasn't eaten by the Kurgan the first time he was killed.</br>  <br>Xyz dragon effect yo</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>    <br> V-Vector? </br>  <br>No really, consider suicide. NTR is one of the worst fetishes in existence.</br>   So this Shun guy's definitely an asshole <br> Wow Shun you're such a jerk turning people into cards <br> Okay fine, you're a jerk I can feel some empathy for <br> Okay you're a justified jerk  <br> Okay you're a justified, caring jerk <br> Okay, you're a badass, justified, caring, loyal jerk <br> ... jerk </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Selena is safe until the end.<br><br>Once we get to the end I think the ride might be too fucking crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuzu's going to eat Ruri, so don't worry, Shun will suffer.</br>  <br>Please no<br>He's suffered enough</br></br>  <br>This is the fair trade-off. Make him badass, but make him suffer the worst.</br>  I miss Yuto, he was the best Yuya.<br><br>I bet Ruri will be the best Ruri.</br></br>  <br>Reiji is technically the biggest badass, all he has are some larger than normal daddy issues</br>  <br>Shuuuuuuun what are you doing on /a/? Don't you have some other place to be perfect in</br>  <br>Maybe the rules dictate the loser fuses with the clone nearest to their location?</br>  <br>Must be this<br><br>If Yugo was closer to Yuto instead of Yuya, he'd probably absorb him too.</br></br></br>  <br>He's going to suffer the mo- <br><br>Well no, no Yuya and Yuzu are going to suffer the most.<br><br>Reiji is going to have one hell of a fall though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still remember Yuzu's eyes sparkling during his speech.</br>  <br>So you're telling me that Yuuya, Yuzu, and Shun are going to suffer the most? <br>Why do you hate my heart</br></br>  <br>Hey man, I don't make the rules. I just enforce them.</br>  <br>Pendant wasn't glowing when that happened.<br><br><br><br>It's cuz Yuto gave Dank Rebellion to Yuta.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Yuya throws it away from his deck, will Yuto come back again?</br>  <br>It'll just teleport right back.</br>    How long does NAC usually upload the raws after the episode airs?<br><br>I'm likely going to miss the livestream but I do want to watch the latest episode as soon as possible.</br></br>  <br>Piggybacking off this question: When are the subs usually available in relation to the actual episode timing? Will I have to wait 'till Monday?</br>  <br>1-2 hours for the lq RAW<br>4-5 hours for the hq RAW</br></br>  I'm just gonna play this card, hope you have some good luck in the next 2-3 turns.  <br>I set the scale with Skullcrobat and Camelose and  normal  summon Elephammer. Fuck your shota bird.</br>  <br>I'm getting rid of part of your pendulum.</br>  <br>The scales stay.</br>  Yo  Post cardfus's smug face.  <br>Summon method dragons are soulbound. They go wherever their Yu goes. Like how Yugo's bike got teleported to Synchro because Clear Wing was in there.</br>  <br>That's fine, would you still like to attack me with Elephammer?</br>    <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Sorry Yuuya, but you've got your girlfriend outclassed</br>  <br>The best one.</br>  <br>Guess I lose.</br>  Are there any cards today that still rely on big attack and not just a pile of effects? All the syncro and xyz stuff i see rarely goes above 3k.  Just think, before Fusion attacked Shun, Yuuto, and Ruri would probably have been major crowd pleasing duelists in their dimension. <br><br>Kuriboh</br></br>  Hey guys remember when Kaiba was legitimately, 100% going to kill himself because Yugi slapped a Mammoth head onto his Ultimate Dragon?  I'm going to try to stay up to watch the stream with you guys tonight, is the doyou stream still up, or are we somewhere else now?  <br>Didn't he melt it with those arrows?</br>  Hi. I'm the guy from last week who just realized GX has been licensed in his country since April.  Which one would defeat the other, Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon or Clear Wing Synchro Dragon?  <br>All streams are dead due to sharing, we are here for the 2ch livewatch and later for raws.</br>  <br>The greatest EGAOtainers.</br>  <br>Some decks still do, but good luck winning with them when half the meta has a full field and half their deck gone through searching within the first 3-4 turns and all of their effects completely wipe your backrow, frontrow, graveyard, extra deck, etc. from even being used half the time, and they just sit there and laugh at you because the meta is beyond broken.</br>  <br>Blue Eyes<br>STILL the king BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</br></br>  <br>Rebellion.

OERD doesn't target though.</br>  <br>Clear Wing, the only card Yuya could use to stop Clear Wing is Vortex Dragon and that's not happening because it's either a fusion of Odd-Eyes and Clear Wing based on rough design or something completely different (the most likely case). <br><br>Yuya will just rely on action cards to beat Yugo if they ever duel, which I don't think they actually will honestly.</br></br></br>  <br>CLEAR WING ACCEL SYNCHRO DRAGON WHEN?</br>  How does one have a baby with a time traveling robot?  <br>Gosh, Yuugo's mom has some long hair</br>  <br> Yuya will just rely on action cards to beat Yugo <br>I'm confident this BS is gonna happen with the Jack rematch, and it'll be horrible.</br></br>   Jack will never marry his qt nerd waifu while being congratulated by his adoring child fans <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>The fact that they decided to make the cutest YGO MC the straightest one makes me ask the same thing.</br>  <br><br>wait, so who is right? one anon says the stream is still up, the other says are kill</br></br>  <br>JAADGE</br>  <br>There is another stream, but said stream has a delay of 2min. or so, and it's laggy as hell.</br>  Is Yu-Gi-Oh one of the only anime to consistently produce 10/10 waifus?  <br>Then I found that 5Ds just entered my country on Tuesday.</br>  So is there a stream besides the shark stream that's stable and if so whose dick I gotta suck to get a discreet link to it.    <br>The funny thing is 5Ds got an official sub right as it was confirmed they will be traveling to the Synchro dimension.</br>  <br>Arc-V is so loaded with 10/10 boys and girls it's ridiculous.</br>  <br>How fitting it is that Fusion and Fusion's dragons are the strongest while Eago and Tomoto's dragons are the weakest due to them being from pussy dimensions where the inhabitants actually played duels for fun.</br>  <br>Yet OERD beats CWSD</br>  <br>Standard Blue-Eyes upgraded form's ATK</br>  <br> mfw it's to the point where I can't decide whether or not I want to be Yuzu or Yuuya </br>  <br>The ‚Äúapprehension team‚Äù awaits Y≈´ya and co., who attempt to escape from the Detention Facility!

I figure people buying these up would already have figures of them, are excited for something new that isn't a prize fig, or are looking forward to displaying a themed set of all five.

Please tell.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, didn't happen.<br><br>Only general threads did that (Strike Witches, Im@s , SnW, and the like) did that, and that's hat made buyfag thread different, discussion was kept within a thread and following threads were not linked to each other besides the ones during wonfes.</br></br></br>  <br>James are you going to collect all variants of the seven deadly sins?

What changed.</br>  <br>Anon, threads don't last as long as they used to, that's is in general.</br>  <br>Obvious as well, as the userbase grows the number of buyfags grows proportionally.<br><br><br>Plus, it's easier than ever to buy shit from overseas.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The season?</br>  <br> implying summer ever ended <br>Sure, the kids come and go but the normals have been in here for years.</br></br>  <br> no tail <br>such a shame</br></br>  Euphonium merch when?  <br> Kyanus releasing their cash cows this soon <br><br><br>Hah, prepare for subpar figures by themselves, then some months/years later some better manufacturers might pick the franchise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still waiting for a good Mirai figure.

I've started giving the local kijiji page a shot, may try to paw some off at the upcoming local con in August too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just throw it on ebay. Ebay alone has made me a grand from selling like 6 items. Does not include another 500+ I sold to anons on these sites last week. Give us first pick and the left over throw on ebay for those idiots.</br>  i want this figure now im waiting for it to drop half its price like griffon's previous 1/2.5 figure did   Subtotal: 7,480 JPY <br> Shipping: 6,520 JPY <br><br>wtf amiami/ems</br></br></br>  <br> Ebay is good to make extra money on because most people who buy anime stuff on it either don't know how to buyfag or have too much money to care. The only downfall is getting charged with fees but it's worth it.<br><br> buy six anime dvds for a certain series at FYE on clearance years ago <br> sell them for almost $200 on Ebay last month </br></br></br></br>  <br>shipping won't drop though</br>  <br>Books?</br>  <br>No a single figure.<br><br>Though I guess it is 40cm tall.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I know this is offtopic, but how much ebay charges you for selling stuff? I've been reading their guide and all and it only says ""we will charge a fee" or something along the lines, but not an exact % or whatever.</br></br>  <br>Wow, congrats for making back so much. My shit is far from as valuable as yours, I'm sure, I mainly have a lot of small items so using ebay doesn't feel worth it, especially with shipping/conversion fees and etc. I've also had SOME success with the local kijiji, if my arranged sale for 2 mystery box trading figs work out (selling them 30$ a pop, bought them for ~8 a few years back)<br><br>That said I do believe pic related is something no one in my vicinity can appreciate/would have enough interest in. The figma is untouched (never opened), box is a little banged up but that's about it. I'll try making a list  they're mostly Fate/and Tales of , it's just daunting work.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe do a lot sale?</br>  <br>I want that, sell it to me</br>  <br>That shouldn't matter.... they are taking you are a ride or you picked the wrong shipping.</br>  <br>I only have one option though</br>  <br> Never ever. </br>  <br>Now see that I would slap down money for</br>  <br>I saw the painted version on twitter in the wonfes tag about a week ago. It looks bad.</br>  Is there anywhere decent to get the Patchouli nendo anymore? It slipped under my radar but I'd really like to get my hands on it.  <br>but are you a secondary, i'm not sure I can do business with secondaries<br><br>Shitposting aside, are you serious?</br></br></br>  <br> There are some small fees for bonus options that you probably won't use.<br> subtitled listing <br> listing in multiple categories <br> uploading more than 6 photos <br> making over twenty listings in one month <br> fixed-price listings instead of auctions (these are like those month-long listings) <br><br>At the end of the month you get charged with a final fee that's a percentage of the amount you made from selling stuff, I think it's something like 10%. This is the shit part of using Ebay but if you manage to sell your items over what their value is you're not really losing much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you still have it?</br>  <br>Sounds like they are jewing you then.</br>  <br>Fatefags are inherently secondaries because it's babbies first VN</br>  <br>Depends on how much you want for it, but yes I'm interested.<br><br><br>Wow rude.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No I didn't save it, sorry.</br>  <br>The fee is usually 10% of the final value. There are also small insertion fees that can add up if you sell a ton of items, but watch your special deals. Ebay usually offers a number of free insertions and such every month or sometimes even better deals like 1000 free fixed price inserts or something. Just do whatever it seems will cost you the least and maybe wait for a better deal to show up if you can. Also upcharge on the item and the shipping a bit if you can to cover the fees a little.</br>  <br>amiami plz</br>  <br> 533x800 <br><br>Have the high resolution</br></br></br>   tfw figure gets released you really want and extras are available but won't have enough to pay for it until next week, only to have it suddenly get sold out. <br> tfw scalpers are already charging double the price online </br>  <br>what figure anon?</br>  <br/>  <br>K</br>  <br><br><br>Here's the pic. <br><br><br><br>Thanks for the info and tips, anons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you guys ever worry about your figurines getting all dusty or breaking? Or that you might lose them if you move out from your current place? I don't really buy decorations or unnecessary stuff because of this. My room is quite literally a just bed, desk and computer, but I really want to get some Nichijou figurines. How do you overcome this fear?  <br>fanbook Nozomi</br>  <br>No.</br>  post your preorders  <br>Well if you put a mini paper bag over the head...</br>  <br>only thing I can say is to buy some wall shelves anon.</br>  <br>Alter set is boring and old. I never wanted them. The colors are better here.<br><br>Let me guess, you own the Alter set.</br></br></br>  <br>Your figures aren't going to just spontaneously break. If you're worried about your desk collapsing or something I'd be more worried about your computer.</br>  <br> email me at friedkun@gmail.com once you have a list or whatever.. </br>  <br>back off I called dibs</br>  do I dare buy the vivid butt?  <br>do you have a mother fucking rita mortio figure?</br>  <br>This is true, but as time passes and the quality of the fanbase diminishes  &gt;implying it was ever quality in the first place , the definition of secondaries has also grown lax for me. i.e. only got into the series because of the ufotable anime.<br><br><br>I'd like around 150 I think? But that's without taking in account of shipping, bwuh. 40$+ would suck.<br><br><br><br>O-oh...<br>Someone pls either spoonfeed me shipping recs or teach me secrets to lowering them while ensuring delivery security. Wanting to sell a small thing for 10$ and having to pay the same amount to ship it out is the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck I should have just ordered her off NY as soon as she went up. <br><br>If I forward from Animaru she'll end up costing as much as BIJ's price anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Only the One Coin Grande Kotobukiya collection  which I own the whole set, minus Judith and Yuri I'll probably manage to jew off locally thanks to kijiji . I was at my buyfag high in 2010~2011, I calmed down when they started releasing the Alter ones.</br>  <br><br>Almost everything is a bit off and worse than the illustration. Shame, it surely wasn't simple to design this one...</br></br>  <br>Damn. Would of paid top $ for the alter one.</br>    <br><br>Amazon.jp would have only been like 3200 yen shipping, but it's now 1.6x more expensive. Still considerably cheaper than EMS would be.</br></br>   Sell a nendo on ebay, get fucked over by the buyer, forced to refund  <br> Buyer contacts me today saying they received the item and are willing to pay me back  <br>Guess now I'll be able to get my doujins.</br></br>  <br> Nendofags are retarded <br>Nothing new</br></br>  Hmmm, another Link nendo.  <br>I live in australia and its like the shipping is about 2x more than america even though we're basicly the same distance away. fucking jew cunts asbfduyebgswgfb.<br><br><br>wow thats nice to hear<br>i bought a beelzebub bonus from someone on mfc and havent got it yet im going to dispute that nigger soon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First sexy loli I've ordered in a while, thanks for posting her. Might have missed her otherwise.</br>  <br>Shit happens with postal shipping - wouldn't be too sure it's the buyer that was wrong.<br><br><br>Good to hear.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did he tell you it shipped?</br>  <br> Hi there! I had this sent out on the 16th. If it's not there yet, it will be soon! (sent 7 days ago) <br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>They are stunning to look at, I watched every single one of them get announced/released and struggled with temptation each time, coming out with my wallet unscathed  for better or worse, I seriously cannot tell . Good luck on your search, anon.</br>  <br>Well it might be caught up in customs who knows?<br>I don't know how long you have until you aren't allowed to make a dispute anymore but I'd wait until monday or tuesday if you can before doing so.</br></br>  <br>Why would you dispute it then? After the seller ships it it's not his responsibility anymore. I'm guessing you choose a method without tracking/insurance, too?</br>  <br>Yeah i have bought something from china before that took 5 weeks to get here. I disputed him and got a refund then 2 weeks later got the item lmao. To be fair the item description advertised "30 day shipping guaranteed" or something so i didn't feel that bad</br>  <br>then fuck it, get it for free nigga.</br>  <br>it's a private sale if he wanted to cover his arse he should've added tracking himself</br>  <br>It'd be perfect if she was bigger.</br>  <br>What the fuck. You need to email them and ask if that is right. A 14 inch pvc figure should not cost that much with EMS. Unless you are in South America or Asia accoding to their shipping rates. http://www.amiami.com/top/page/t/fa<wbr>q2.html#2<br><br>According to most sites, that megaman figure is 1.3kg or so not including packaging weight. You are getting jewed.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>No, it's on you to choose tracking. You had the option and you declined, now you shouldn't be able to come back crying for a refund.<br>Try taking responsibility for your actions for once.

I wrapped a tiny piece of scotch tape around itself and put it in where the adhesive is.<br><br>Shit sucks.</br></br></br>  <br>The pads they used just aren't great. Mine fell off 4-5 times the first day but has somehow managed to stay on since.<br><br>On a side note, Mammon's basket has been the opposite experience. It was fine getting her basket to stay in her hand when she came out but the other day I wanted to move some figs around in my display case and trying to get the basket to stay in her hand again has been a complete nightmare.

I know it's based off of what their user desires one they gain Requiem but why doesn't their Stand gain that power in the first place when it's first developed?  I like Jojo because it's surprisingly well-written for shounen trash.<br><br> I love the song "My Funny Valentine" </br></br>  <br> shounen trash <br>Nice meme but it's been a Seinen almost longer than it's been a Shounen now.</br></br>  <br>I thought it's only been in a seinen magazine since Part 7.

I would like it more if it was just a super boost in a stand's power.<br><br>What if part 5 ended with Giorno fighting Diavolo in a big ass forest created by GER?</br></br></br>  <br><br>By the time it's finished, it will definitely be more seinen than shonen.</br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/Lghg0-H1-CM  [ ]  <br>It all ties into the series' musical references, and how Bob Fosse once said that most songs are either "I Am" songs or "I Want" songs. Normal stands are like "I Am" songs, which are about the character's personality, job, or role in the story. Requiem stands are like "I Want" songs; they are about desires and goals.<br><br>There are also "I Am Becoming" songs, which tend to mix aspects of "I Am" and "I Want" songs. Typically they're about how someone is growing as a person or how they're achieving their goals and desires. Stands with multiple "Acts" like Tusk are like "I Am Becoming" songs<br><br> I just pulled that out of my ass, but it works. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more like 7 and a half. also, the first 23 chapters were in shonen jump. chapter 24 is the first ultra jump chapter</br>  <br>It's been Seinen for so long, and Part 7 took so long to complete because it went from publication in a weekly Shonen magazine to a monthly Seinen one. There's more Shonen content than Seinen, but it's always sorta been on the border between Shonen and Seinen.</br>  <br>It's based on what you need, not a direct upgrade.</br>  <br>What if what you need is a direct upgrade? :^)<br>Aside from GER.<br><br>Let's assume possible requiem stands are just upgrades then, what would Star Platinum and Hermit Purple requiem be like?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I would like it more if it was just a super boost in a stand's power. <br>They pretty much are. Making everyone fall asleep and switch bodies is way more powerful than "purge armor and stab really fast".<br>And of course there's GER and Bitzadusto (the latter technically is what you wanted albeit not Requiem).</br></br></br>  Hamon or Spin? Which one is your favorite?  <br>Hamon<br> It'll never ever come back ;_; </br></br>  <br>I meant "super boost in a stand's base power".<br>Which means SCR would have something to do with "purge armor and stab really fast".</br></br>  <br> What if someone was able to use both hamon and spin? </br>  <br>Spin</br>  <br>I've always wondered, if requiems are based on what you need and stands are based on who you are as a person, was MiH influenced by Pucci or was it always going to be the go fast gravity horse and Pucci was just the person who got to it first?</br>  <br>You'd rather SCR have infinite speed like Stairway to Heaven? Boring.</br>  <br>How's come you weebs always call it Hamon in these threads and not Ripple? Is Ripple not a direct translation? <br><br> INB4 muh untranslatably subtle Japanese </br></br></br>  <br> Not calling it sendo </br>  <br>Did Dio want the power to attain Heaven? I never understood Dio's motivation for wanting to reset the universe.</br>  <br>MiH wasn't requiem, just an evolved Stand thanks to two other people/stands and DIO. I'm sure anybody else can achieve it.</br>  <br> Is Ripple not a direct translation?  <br>Unfortunately, "Hamon" is how Lucky Land wants it. So it's how it appears in official translations.<br>I think Ignition-One made the right choice, but their scans are over 10 years old and it's not worth shitposting over.</br></br></br>  <br>Because I'm  Brazillian  and Ripple sounds stupid. But then I might as well call it "Onda".</br>  This is the edit I was talking about yesterday.

He's not going to sound like some cockney street thug.</br>  <br>I mean that's fair. But with Joseph's personality he should have more motion in his voice. Joseph wears his emotions on his sleeve.

Its user is a weak human which can be boosted like in the finale of Pt. 3, but that's not enough in later parts, such as when Jotaro stops time to beat KQ.

And its not like Americans are the only people to eat big breakfasts.</br>  <br>Where on that site does it say anything about energy levels due to skipping breakfast? All I can see is "7. Myth: Skipping breakfast is bad and will make you fat." which is not what we where talking about here. <br><br>I can guarantee you that I have less energy in the morning before I eat breakfast and so do the people I meet in the morning.

It's a pain to cook a full breakfast and the cleanup is annoying. <br><br>Having pancakes once every few weeks and will not destroy a diet or undo weeks of exercise.</br></br></br>  <br>No really, explain it to me. Do people think that when they have a cake after dinner that they will pick up 5kg or what? The log of shit they push out in the morning is heavier than the food they ate.</br>  <br>i don't eat pancakes. disgusting carb and sugar bombs are for fatties like OP</br>  <br>And no one claimed it did. What the fuck are you on?</br>  <br>Never seen an English breakfast?<br>Greasy as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Eating like shit with no exercise will make you fat over time, yes. Not everyone has fast metabolisms, I'd even argue that most people don't, judging by America's obesity rates.</br>  Pancakes are a "treat" here and not a staple because they are an "empty calories" type food. <br><br>I don't put syrup on them because they get soggy fast. I never liked eating anything "soggy" or with a soggy texture such as risotto, soggy pancakes, porridge, etc. I like foods to be either dry or chewy. <br><br><br> I only eat the frozen ones, I put them in the toaster until they are crispy and eat them plain like toast. <br><br>I had no idea you could do that. I lower the heat on the griddle (it has multiple heat sections) and move the pancakes over to the low heat section. That way, I toughen them up a little so they are drier and stiffer without burning. That way, the outsides are actually crispy stiff for the first minute or so off the griddle.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically every white country eats like that, I wouldn't expect a third world nigger like you to understand.<br><br>See </br></br></br>  <br> Peanut Butter is also good. <br><br>People put peanut butter on their pancakes?
