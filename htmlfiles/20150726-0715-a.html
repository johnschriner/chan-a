Does that make any of us wrong? I'm just a little worried that the 'peak' of anime has been and past</br>  <br>I think the peak of anime has past, every season now seems to be filled with watered-down adaptations of existing material. <br><br>Hopefully there will be a manga resurgence, even the worst CGDCT is better than most LN.</br></br></br>  I kinda feel bad for him.<br><br>Anime is a medium that can do so much more than pandering to otakus, but doing anything else simply doesn't sell enough.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dU6<wbr>Cp2cB-30</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Miyazaki did nothing wrong    <br>Indeed.

It's not GSC store exclusive I hope.  All these great figures and new nendos, but no decent new animu related figmas. Come on wonfest, you're killing me here!  What's everyones preorders?  <br>go fuck yourself with this bullshit again</br>  <br>Same as last thread.</br>  <br>Wait for it to really start.</br>  In this time before wonfes, i'd like to make a question for all buyfags.<br><br>What is your dream figure that will NEVER get made? And i'm not talking "anything my waifu", i'm talking about a very specific figure based on a illustration or moment from a show that you are 100% sure will never be made, but you'd buy it instantly if it was. As an example, for me it would be a figure based on this illustration.</br></br>  <br>Go fuck yourself.</br>  Hopefully we'll get a painted huke Saber Alter.  <br>I'd be surprised if we didn't to be honest</br>  I Hope there's MonMusu stuff  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br> print this out on all the computers in a computer lab back in high school  <br> somehow don't get in trouble </br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>This.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br> get a boner watching rape and torture shit <br> this made me flaccid <br>thats so fucking disgusting pls kys</br></br></br>  <br>Help me in starting to dislike the mouth too, I don't want to splurge 200 bucks on her but I'm still fine with the crazy face.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128566046 <br> not wanting to watch tama's cute belly get drenched in cum <br>Fag.</br></br>  <br>The only explanation is that one of your school's higher-ups was into scat</br>  <br>Why does this even exist? It looks like shit and it's not relevant to Miku at all, I'm guessing it's based on some dumb illustration.<br><br>Why would you do that when there are tons of worthy Miku modules from the various Project Diva games?<br><br>Retards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your new is showing.</br>  <br>This is actually pretty creative bait, i commend you for the effort</br>  <br> it's not relevant to Miku at all <br><br>You're right.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't get it if you don't want to splurge.<br><br> shitposting this early </br></br></br>  <br>Miku is worst girl anyway. More Luka and Rin figures please.</br>  <br>Is this bait? It has to be, I refuse to believe that someone in here could be this retarded.</br>  <br>Newshit please go</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br>This brings back memories.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br>holy shit I forgot all about this<br><br>man the early 2000s internet was the best. what ever happened to that spirit of fun and laughing at other peoples misfortune?<br><br>I miss the prank pulling 4chan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, i want a Figma Black Hanekawa, in the cat PJ's. I REALLY want her in the bra and panties, but that seems too lewd for GSC, even though they've released lewd figma's before.</br></br>  <br> GK <br>Fuck I may as well.</br></br>  <br>That's the problem, I still want to and not even the mouth is making me want her less. The exclusive thing stings but on the other hand it means flat shipping, she's also not going to come out before April and I could safe up the money if I wanted to.<br>I'll have to wait for tomorrow for a few more pictures and if there are more potential pre-orders for next year that would fuck me over money wise.</br></br>  <br>What? I don't watch shit anime like Wixoss and it looks exactly like Miku.</br>  <br>Looks really good from behind but this face is a bit creepy. Hopefully he'll look better painted.</br>  <br>Then I would advice to just get it. Not all figs are perfect. May as well get it, especially if you're a wixoss fan. Unless they announce new figs its pretty much your only choice aside from nendroids and </br>  <br> shit anime like Wixoss <br>Don't be so salty Borutos only getting prize figs.</br></br>  Hey guys; just a quick question from a non-buyfag.<br>You guys do group orders for blind box type things? I really want to order picture related but I only want Kaede and not the others.<br>(source: amiami; around $30 for the set)</br></br>  <br>I'd treat them like TCG sets and just buy the bulk to guarantee kaede, unless otherwise stated or sold individually.</br>  <br>Check mfc.</br>  <br>check the myfigurecollection forum, they have a group buys section.<br><br>alternatively just sell the ones you don't want on ebay, it might take a while to get rid of them but you'll probably end up making a couple bucks in the end.</br></br></br>  Not really my thing but that's a good figure.  Nice.  <br>Is that some sort of harpie? Kinda sexy.</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, I've done that before but for a set that I could at least give some of the others away to good homes. I just legitimately only care for her in this set and don't know anyone else that would want the rest (other then /jp but I stray from that place). Maybe the eBay route is the way to go.<br><br>Thanks guys. Have a free Kaede.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sirene from Devilman, http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>235960</wbr></br>  <br>It's my kinda thing but that price tag.<br><br>I just want a harpy to hold me in her talons.</br></br></br>  <br>When and where?

Mostly looking out for http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287569, http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287874 and other monster girl figures (just don't really like Sirene enough to buy that)</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Its Alter, so whenever it will be it'll be late.</br></br>  <br>I like harpies but I prefer slime girls.</br>  <br>A dragongirl or loli lamia would be my favorite to get a figure of.</br>  <br> underwear <br><br>It's shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you like Slimes, congrads, there's at least 5 Melona figures and a revoltech.</br></br>  <br>A figure of a girl with huge tits with a gaping asshole with cum or other accessories that can be put inside it.<br><br>OR<br><br>A figure of a girl getting impaled on a dick so big that it deforms her belly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I already have Megahouse's Melona which is the only good looking one.</br>  <br>Please don't use a picture of Chris while shitposting.</br>  <br>These delicious slender bodies have been made for licking</br>  <br><br>The picture doesn't do it justice, but i have the pucchito and it's adorable. http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>35695</wbr></br></br>  <br>Sorry next time I'll use Kirika</br>  <br>Alternatively a PVC of one of the Milk Pot GKs.</br>  <br>same answer as last wonfes</br>  <br>That's better.</br>  canadafag wet dream  Enjoy the twenty-fifth of July.  <br>Goddamn those vagina bones look gross</br>    <br>Looks cute but I'm more into larger figures.</br>  Finally got this in the mail today.

I'm afraid to buy the Skytube figure, i'd be platinum mad if it arrived broken.</br></br>  <br>10 hours or so</br>  <br>Almost fell for your bait. Good work anon.</br>  <br>her back would work too</br>  <br>Berserk nendos.</br>  <br>Scales of the final fight of Jojo part 3. Specifically the scene where Jotaro and Dio both go in to punch with their stands at the same time.</br>  Just putting this here. Hope they put out a prototype soon.   waifu collection projected to grow too big by the end of the year <br> buy another one of these just for figures <br><br>Am I the only one that stores waifus in closed cabinets and only bring them out when its time to flex my powerlevel?<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/Sterilite-014<wbr>28501-4-Shelf-Utility-Platinum/dp/B<wbr>000063SLI/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Something has always been really off about those to me.</br>  <br>I have them and only Dio has a weird sculpt and paintjob.</br>  <br>Might as well put them back in their boxes if you are hiding them in a closed cabinet</br>  <br>What does this say?</br>  <br>Do you have a room with no window? How do you protect them from sunlight?</br>  <br> waifus <br> plural </br></br>  <br>Also, weren't Dio and The World sold seperately? That's a pain in the ass, too.</br>  <br> not having multiple figures of your waifu </br>  what do you do with your lewd figures?  <br>Pretty sure I preordered them together as a set from BiJ.</br>  <br><br>Unfortunately and surprisingly, nothing. <br><br>Give me suggestions of how to pose my Queen's Blade Revoltechs guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That Tama face doesn't go with that lewd body</br>  <br>Pose them  on top of a hot plate. </br>  <br>I can always build the cabinet without the doors, or keep the doors open for display. Closed cabinets make it easy to keep my figures safe and relatively free from dust and sunlight while still being easily accessible when its time to  fap vigorously .</br>  <br>Get a detolf dumbass.</br>  <br>This figure. Except good and without the stupid actual-feather wings. It's a garage kit that only one was made of. Even the kit never got released as far as I know.</br>  <br><br>I live in a first world country, we don't own hot plates here</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for the Max Factory one.<br>The face of the FuRyu looks weird</br></br>  <br>Somewhat. My displays have curtains, but nothing is stopping people from moving those.</br>  <br>Easier to draw and people don't mind it.</br>  <br>figures won't fade with as long as their not directly positioned in sunlight, you fucking retard. and regular cabinets don't do anything against dust either, as it would need to airtight. but as someone that faps to figures and then hides them away in a closed cabinet, it's no surprise you're so stupid.</br>  <br>he's talking about multiple cabinets. unless it's saber or miku I find that quite unlikely.</br>  <br>Then put it on the induction plate you elitist cunt.</br>      <br> Get a detolf <br><br> Detolf <br> Width: 16 3/4 " <br> Depth: 14 3/8 " <br> Height: 64 1/8 " <br> Max load/shelf: 13 lb <br> $70 <br> have to drive to Ikea to pick up <br><br> Sterilite <br> Width: 25 5/8 " <br> Depth: 18 7/8 " <br> Height: 69 3/8 " <br> Max load/shelf: 40 lb <br> $77 <br> free Amazon shipping <br><br>Yeah, I'll take the one with more space/$.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because noses are ugly. and sometimes they have no nose at all in the frontal perspective. praise non-euclidean geometry.</br>    Don't forget to preorder the 2015 figure of the yearâ¢!  <br> cabinets don't do anything against dust either <br>That's patently bullshit.<br> how circulation work <br>There is hardly any in a cabinet so little dust is deposited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason for a detolf is that it's a display case. To display them from all sides. With that fancy "glass" stuff instead of dead tree dust.</br>    <br>Why is the word year trademarked?</br>  <br>Truly sufferring</br>    <br> those bellies <br>Jesus fuck</br></br>  <br>Vivid Red<br><br>At this point, there is no hope.</br></br></br>  <br> no miyu </br>  <br>I was it lucky to get it used, but in excellent condition for pretty cheap, so I can't complain. But yeah, the Max Factory one does have a better face and better hair, I'd say.</br>  ARIA finally get a new season, please give me a good quality fig of Akari WF!<br>Or better a good quality of her adult self, PLEASE!</br>  <br>Not him but I cut apart a large box, put foil on the side facing out and put it in the window directly across from my figures. It works well and keeps the heat out. The other window I just put a throw blanket over since it doesn't get direct sunlight and you can't see it from the outside.</br>  So what will you ask for uncle WonFes this year? <br>Personally I hope that figure of Millia from Guilty Gear Xrd by Wing shows up.</br>  <br><br><br>who is this fine and classy lady?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger detected</br></br>  <br>I second this.<br><br>I believe they made Vivid blue and Vivid yellow, so why they didn't made the best one ?</br></br></br>  <br> Akatsuki  <br>YESSS</br></br>  <br>They're just building suspense...</br>  <br>Where is she from? Stockings with those shorts + boots + comfy hoodie makes her adorable</br>  <br>She is from Tokyo Ravens.</br>  Any news or hope of the ooyodo nendo this wonder guys?  <br>I didn't see any teasers of her on the gsc twitter, but there was a taihou nendo teased</br>  <br>I hope it's her, all this lack of info is making me nervous she's not being made.</br>    <br>Hate to reply to a frogposter but I'd die for a good Judeau. Even the GK appears on YA approximately once every ten years.</br>  <br>I want the dragon form of nowi way more than a normal scale of her.</br>  <br>Any Momoiro.</br>  <br>Were you unable to read the English on the cover and google it yourself?<br><br>Are you even able to read my reply?

I think she's my favorite Alter witch. I was silly for not pre-ordering her.  What's the word on this Mio?  <br>The English on the cover doesn't say the name of the LN, and your reply didn't say it either.<br>  æ±äº¬ã¬ã¤ãã³ãº </br></br>  <br>Can't say that makes me sad.<br>Their character designs are fairly bland most of the time.</br></br>  <br><br>The Volks witches are really good. I own all of them. If you're trying to decide between that or the Alter one pick the pose you like the most. They're both great.</br></br>  <br>They make scale figures as well as PAK but the quality is normally mediocre to really bad.</br>  Would anything happen to a figure if it was in a car for a few hours and it's like 80 degrees out? It's in a parking garage though so it's in the shade.  When the fuck does Wonfes begin?  <br>Tomorrow at 6pm.</br>  <br>In 30mins time.</br>  <br>It's 1am in Japan, Jesus anon let them sleep.</br>  I need this  <br>You missed it, it was yesterday.</br>  <br>We are two anon, I want her to join my Sol and my futur Ky</br>  <br>Her face feels off to me</br>  <br>A year from now</br>  <br>Depends on the type of figure anon</br>  <br>She physically suffers from her body.</br>  <br>I'm not a fan of titty monsters but she looks amazing.</br>  <br>She's not a whore though.</br>  <br>I agree with the other anon.

Tsubasa is really obnoxious and I wanted Utsutsu/Hajime/Sugane/Katze with Rui, anyone but her or Rhythm.</br>  please no kill rui  I can respect a show that knows where its strengths lie  I am so fucking sick of Gel.  <br>No bully</br>  <br>She deserves it though.</br>  <br>You'll make Utsutsu  gloomy </br>  <br>Did we find out where this is from?</br>    So what's going to happen to Rizumu in the end? Surely it's not going to be an "all's well that ends well" type thing and he becomes a new Gatchaman. But I can't really imagine anyone killing him either.  <br> Gel ends up killing him because everyone just wants Rui to be ok and that's the fastest way to do it. <br> everyone gets on edge with her because of this. </br></br>  <br>Redeems himself by helping the Gatchas overthrow Gel's mind control over the rest of the world</br>  Cthuko when?  <br>Hajime puts him in her chest.</br>  <br>The episode hasn't aired yet, you id---oh. Never mind.</br>  <br>While checking on Nyaa I found the video to insight by White Ash.<br><br> inb4 the singer looks like Rui: I know and it's super disturbing. </br></br></br>  Why can't Rui stay dedd?  <br>Too moe for the living world and too moe for the afterworld. Neither will take him, neither can keep him</br>  <br><br>Because the collective lust after his boypussy of anons around the world made him an invincible goddess. That's why.</br></br>  <br>We Madoka now?</br>  <br>Obviously, but the real question is: will he become the right of the left boob?</br>  <br>What if he becomes  the ass ?</br>  <br> picture mostly centered around ass <br> draws no ass <br>what the fuck artist</br></br></br>  <br>In all fairness there aren't a lot of Hajime ass shots because she's paizuri b8<br>Child bearing hips though</br></br>   insert <br> not using actual episode title "penetration" <br><br>One job!</br></br></br>  <br> Rui's effort to prove his point is now nothing more than public humiliation thanks to Tsubasa <br> everyone rejoices <br><br>I hope there's a catch to this.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Pretty sure in S1 she wasn't reduced to saying the same line over and over.</br>  <br>It's episode 4 of a season where the new alien possibly has the ability to manipulate people's opinion.Of course there is a catch! <br><br>(Also in episode 00 the VO (Sugane?) said that the world was saved "thanks to [...] Rui's trust in people". No way they are going to prove him wrong).</br></br></br>    Cool.  <br>You are fucking retarded</br>  Reminder that the episode is one hour late. Starts at 3:00/27:00 JST.  <br>They could just record that line and save some budget for all those shiny transformations</br>  <br> Tumblr. </br>  <br>Yes, yes, but before that?</br>  <br>That's a bit creepy. They were inserting references of things that were going to happen two years later that happened to be when the sequel aired.</br>  <br>Ask them, they were the ones that found the image.</br>  <br>Eh, too lazy.</br>  <br>Hey, Joe makes the garbage man outfit look good.</br>  <br>Stop being lazy.<br> http://tsubasamisudachi.tumblr.com/<wbr>ask</wbr> </br></br>  <br>T-too shy!</br>  GERURURURU  <br>He'll go to jail like Umeda.</br>  <br>They will be. But won't happen until episode 7.</br>  remember when Sugane was relevant? yeah me neither  <br>Most Gatchaman got their development in season 1 except for Hajime, so she's getting some this season. The only reason why Rui still features and gets fleshed out it's because he's the main heroine of the show.</br>  <br>It's over anon, Hajime, Tsubasa and Rui are the only Gatchaman with any relevance anymore.</br>  <br>Sugane will gain relevance again if he wears a dress and a wig.</br>  I'm sure there is a reason they decided to introduce a new character instead of focusing on the ones they already had  <br>It's Tiger &amp; Bunny all over again, great cast but they tend to focus on less interesting characters. But i'll take Hajime/Gel over Barnaby any day.</br>  <br>More yuri potential with Hajime is the only answer I can think of.</br>    <br>But Hajime is asexual anyway. Or aliensexual at most.</br>  <br>She likes stationary.</br>  <br> likes </br>  <br>You get my point.</br>  Are we sure it's delayed by one hour? I can't moon, but the official twitter didn't say anything about that  <br>She thinks Rui is handsome I haven't heard her talk about finding other characters attractive before</br>    <br>At least Tsubasa isn't annoying. I wish I could say the same for Gel though. I still might drop it if I don't get my fix of OD and Utsutsu</br>  <br><br>https://twitter.com/GATCHAMANCrowds<wbr>/status/624848994166910976<br> æ¬æ¥ã¯æ¥æ¬ãã¬ãã«ã¦27æããã¨éãã®æ¾ééå§ã¨ãªãã¾ãã <br> 27æ <br><br>http://www.ntv.co.jp/program/detail<wbr>/21842309.html<br> 07æ26æ¥ï¼æ¥ï¼3:00ï½3:30 <br> 3:00 </br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>aaah, thank you, I was looking for a 26:55/ 27:00.<br>Saving the second link for the future!</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa <br> not annoying as fuck </br></br>  <br> Thought this was going to be a Gaogaigar thread </br>  <br>She thinks rui's beautiful and cute.

At least Tsubasa fucks up. Hajime is never wrong about anything. Just let Berg take over her body or something, the show would improve tenfold.</br>  <br>Well the show seems to be setting up something terrible with Hajime.</br>  <br>No problem! If you go to http://www.ntv.co.jp/program/ by default it takes you to the current airing program and highlights it, but if you ctrl+F ã¬ããã£ãã³ ã¯ã©ã¦ãº ã¤ã³ãµã¤ã, you will always be able to find the current week's episode time slot.

Since you are so nice, do you know why the stream makes it look like it will air at 24:00? <br>I figured it out as I was typing, is it chinese time?</br></br>  <br>*24:57</br>  <br>It's obvious something will happen with Hajime and Berg Katze</br>  <br>One can only hope for some form of mind grape as Hajime enters an existential crisis questioning her own identity</br>  <br>I-I'm not nice. Yeah, I think it's Chinese/the streamer's time. If I recall correctly, China's timezone is the same as Japan's minus one hour (Japan 25:55 = China 24:55) and there's always lag when streaming, so that might explain the 2 minute difference. I'm not really sure, though.</br>  <br>I dunno, for a psychopathic murderous alien Katze seems relatively alright with her. I'm expecting something else to go horribly wrong first, like Hajime being seriously wrong for the first time.</br>  <br>That'd probably be too much to hope for. I doubt either Rui or Hajime will be seriously wrong this season.</br>  Any significant improvements in the BDs?<br> cthuko BDs when </br>  <br> Any significant improvements in the BDs? <br>No, there are touches here and there but nothing major.</br></br>  <br> cthuko BD <br>Isn't the AnimeNOW release done with cthuko's subs?</br></br>  Doyu or somewhere else?  <br>It is.</br>  <br>In a few years I'm sure they'll do the BDs.</br>  <br>What's the problem then?</br>  Did the streamer forgot?  <br>None, and I'm not that anon.</br>  <br> Stream <br>Where?</br></br>  Started.

You should study for another hour or two and take a break later when the subs are out, the episode is already halfway through.</br>    <br>I like Utsutsu but that hand of life thing takes out any drama this show could have.</br>  <br>It's not Dragon Ball reviving everyone levels of bad yet.</br>  <br>Doesn't it shorten her own life span though?</br>  <br>I think so. It looks like she needed help, too.<br><br>It might be a little late for the warning but don't click the pictures if you don't want to be spoiled.</br></br></br>      <br>Supposedly using that and cloning herself both hurt her. But she does both all the damn time with no real consequences.</br>  <br>I thought those thumbnails with yotsuba were here to hide porn and jokes.</br>  <br><br>I think she can transfer life energy or something. She can use her own battery or someone else's, but it can't come from nowhere. If she pulls too hard on her own battery, she'll die.</br></br>  <br>That too.</br>  It's happening.

A lot of it is just shit from S1.</br>  Will they change the opening next episode in the parts where young gelsadra appears?  So did Tsubaka fuck up as badly as anons predicted last week or does the public trust them more after seeing Bane do what he did.  <br>I'm surprised they didn't already given that you got to see each Gatcha's transformed version in the OP the episode they were going to henshin</br>  <br>One of the greatest scientific discovery of the century!</br>  Looks like Rizumin surrendered after Tsubasa and Gel started kicking the red crowds around saying that he already accomplished what he went there for.  <br>It looks like everything is smiles and rainbows.

Who would hate Josuke?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not a meme faggot, it's faith.</br>  <br> hating Gay Priest <br><br>Gay priest will be arriving shortly to correct that.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh no Kars was the genius that created the mask that created vampires. He was the leader of a crusade against humanity from 2000 years ago that an entire army of humans fought to seal away. Literal first thing they do is impale human beings to feast on their blood. It's later revealed that their race had lived secluded from humanity and didn't need to go out and feed on humans. Kars killed em all, and didn't even leave a woman alive for some reason, now being guilty of genocide against two races of beings.</br>  <br><br>Part 6 isn't going to get animated and neither will Part 4. They animated the part normies care most about, they will stop now.</br></br>  It's kinda ironic that a gay priest got killed by an underage shota.  <br>Kars did nothing wrong.</br>  7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;shit&gt;the rest  <br>It was only Kars that hated humans and wanted to kill them, though.</br>  Gay priest is here now.  <br>Gay Priest might not come to a thread full of heretics.</br>  <br><br>Oh, nevermind, he's here now.</br></br>  <br>Where are you getting this shit from?</br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;6&gt;2&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3</br>  <br> arrow being setup since part <br> getting new powers from the arrow a thing since kira <br> the entire last two volumes spent on finding the arrow for the single purpose of beating the boss and it turns out to work <br>vs<br> strohiem is suddenly on the plane <br> vacano ride into space but that only worked because kars decided to get off the rock, got hit by joseph's hand which shouldn't even be able to pierce his skin, get hit by several rocks which pushed him into space <br> also joseph survives the fall back to earth that should have killed him even if he landed in the water <br><br><br>OK nigga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3</br>  Joseph best Jojo  <br>2 is heavily overrated and it lives only on Joseph being entertaining as hell, most of the other characters are crap and it never compares to the best moments of the other parts.</br>  <br> arrow being setup since part <br>to give stands<br> getting new powers from the arrow a thing since kira <br>getting manageble powers through the arrow. Bites the Dust isn't that powerful and can easily be defeated as shown.<br> the entire last two volumes spent on finding the arrow for the single purpose of beating the boss and it turns out to work <br>In a way that completely defeats all build up, requires no talent or using your brains and is nothing more than 'I stab myself, now I instantly win without challenge". Even Jotaro used his brains to defeat Dio.<br><br>Stroheim barely did anything there except breaking Joseph's fall<br>Kars lost because he got distracted by Joseph using his "your next line will be X" trick while volcanic rocks were clearly flying up everywhere around him<br>The surviving part I'll give you.<br><br>So on one hand we have a MC who wins through sheer luck, the same luck that has saved him his entire life.<br>On the other hand we have a lousy final battle that only happened because Araki wrote himself into a corner, forgetting that they already had a working trick against Diavolo that didn't involve pulling an arrow out of your butt.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128570105#p128577845">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You only hate part 2 because you don't want to look like an animefag</br>  <br>I don't hate any Jojo part.

So maybe he'll become less boring.</br></br></br>  <br> killed all his friends </br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I hate Griffith with every fiber of my being, but he didn't consider them his friends but rather comrades and stepping stones to his own kingdom.</br>  Hey BOYS a few days ago I uploaded they first few pages of 338 translated off someone here on /a/ but he stopped before finishing the translation.<br>I did my best to complete it based on a summary I found and a Korean friend I have on steam.<br>Its probably all wrong, but here it is. 388 translated.<br>http://imgur.com/a/K8IXE</br></br></br>  <br>Are you that guy that wanted to know if humans ever fuck up any monsters?</br>  So what are the odds that Guts and Caska, both being branded, is gonna fuck with the Elfheim protection?  <br> Implying the next member of the JRPG band won't be Silat </br>  <br>haha<br> are there any legit korean speakers here? </br></br>  <br>Griffith is basically medieval reinhard.</br>  <br>The Koreans fucking pirate everything, so they have no reservations about putting everything on the internet as soon as they get it, unlike the Japanese</br>  <br>If I wasn't such a lazy shit that let my Korean slip I might qualify, but as with everything in my life, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you anon</br>  <br> Griffith is basically medieval reinhard. <br><br>No where close.</br></br></br>  <br>I only speak north korean</br>  <br>Is Isma already in it?</br>  <br>Yes, she joined up in the last couple of chapters.</br>  Falconia is a sacrificial site for demons...  <br>Griffith is already on the top, what does he gain from more sacrifices?</br>  <br>Becoming an elder god. He went from Jesus to god and all that's left is elder status.</br>  <br>i love you</br>   Rickart dealing with the fact he just slapped Griffith the entire chapter. <br><br>For years people have been asking for Guts to get off the boat, so can we please get him off the fucking boat?</br></br>  <br>Griffith? I say fuck you punk, Rape my girl and shit, is all junk.</br>    <br> Jesus to God <br> not knowing the Holy Trinity <br>enjoy hell faggot<br>Griffith did nothing wrong</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm tired of motherfucking griffith, Raping my gal while i'm chilling in the shack and showing it in my face and for what?</br>  <br>Aren't we getting a new chapter with a hundred pages soon like first? If so then that may be when Guts gets off the boat.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12855175 <br>Fucking nips and their noble ways</br>  <br>The hundred pages was refresher</br>  <br><br>The holy trinity?<br><br>Santa<br>Jesus<br>Ronald Reagan</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ronald Reagan </br>   Rickert repairs a firefighting machine <br><br>This is called Chekov's Gun. There's gonna be a fire/disaster in Falconia and they're gonna need those things.</br></br>  Whatever happened to<br> *sniff* thank you Griffith, thank you for raping me </br>  When was the last time we saw Zodd? He's not in Falconia.<br><br>Prediction: He's leading the assault on Elf Island.</br></br>  <br> Griffith is already on the top, what does he gain from more sacrifices? <br><br>Strong hints and shit say Griffith = Anti-Christ and that he and/or God Hand want to bring about the end of the world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This shit is WAY more interesting than anything that has been happening on the boat. I sped through Sea God arc and was bored by it all. No drama and it has no bearing on the over all plot. Falconia stuff is great. We're seeing Silat play a major role in the story for once, Rickert is in danger, and Rashkas is gonna fuck things up.</br></br>  <br>Sea God was character development (JRPG party leveling up) and posed more questions about The Boy. <br><br>It was satisfying for me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The main conflict was Mermaid girl, the Island and the fight with Sea God. I cared for none of it. It wasn't very good horror, and the interactions between Isidro and Mermaid girl were boring. Whole thing felt like filler or padding out the story and isn't needed.</br></br>  When was the last time someone was raped?  <br>When did this last hiatus start</br>  <br>One whole year of no Berserk is rape.</br>  <br> wanting anyone else in Guts party to suffer as the band did </br>  <br>This is a popular misconception. The Devil doesn't want to bring the end of the world. In fact, he is against it.</br>  Griffith wants to be the hero of his own story so much, it's cute. I hope he kills Guts and that scheming sandnigger so he can happily lead his big family to peace and prosperity.  Berserk Saga part 2 when?<br>Even though they fucked up a few things in the Golden Arc I want the Black Swordsman arc animated</br>  <br>It just came out today. I'm impressed someone gave a huge fuck and uploaded ASAP.<br><br>I don't mind waiting for a new chapter.  I'm slightly behind anyways </br></br></br>   new Berserk chapter <br> new Farmland Saga chapter <br>Oh i love this</br></br>  <br><br>Movies bombed HARD. We're never gonna get more. They may have not broken even.</br></br>  <br>Disagree. You could say the same about most of Enoch.</br>  <br> Reincarnation of evil <br> Happy ending </br></br>  <br>Why can't a competent animation studio just pick up from where the TV show left off and keep doing its thing? I want out of the Golden Age.</br>  <br>Maybe one day after the manga ends.<br> Hahahahahahah. </br></br>  <br>Why is she so fucking cute? I can't stand it.</br>  <br>It was truly magnificent. Seeinjg the humans working together with the apostles was really something special, and it'll be really hard to see that stuff happening again in such a massive scale. It was also the conflict where Irvine showed his apostle form for the first time, which was awesome.</br>  <br>Ok, I don't get why literally everyone on /a/, or in fact even in my real life friends say Berserk is godly.<br><br>At first I though it was it was created a long time ago, thus human minds automatically think "Old but Gold", but then I started hearing more and more about it and I began reading.<br><br>I honestly on't see the appeal, like help me out here. I think it's just an edgelord manga with things not for the faint of heart thus 4chan likes it. I can't see passed the yelling, raging and bullshit that goes on, easily avoidable situations plays out so stupidly. Is there something i'm missing? Aside from that the art is just glorious, I feel that's the only main appeal to this edgelord manga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The next time we'll see squads of human soldiers and apostles fighting together in formation is when Guts storms Falconia for whatever reason.<br><br>Hawk Lancers riding tamed griffons with a flying apostle captain, backed up by human archers and perhaps a sorcerer or two calling the spirits of the fallen to attack directly or possess footsoldiers to empower them. Shit's gonna be legendary.</br></br></br>  <br>We haven't seen necromancers yet have we?</br>  <br>Guts was doing the hot apostle that killed Corkus in the very first chapter.<br><br>Which begs the question: which apostle or astral creature in this series would you want to make your monster waifu?<br><br>Personally I wouldn't mind making the pseudo harpy with owl eyes for tits apostle my monstergirl waifu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isma is important. Next party member and waifu.<br><br>I have to imagine the next time we see Guts, they are getting off the boat.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to see Apostles get fucked up. Especially the ones that took Guts' arm and eye. <br><br>I also really want to know what more of the sane apostles sacrificed. I consider Ganishka a sane one. He sacrificed a human and was the most powerful one to date, could the others have sacrificed something not human like the egg?</br></br></br>  <br>Berserk takes a very appealing concept and spins it into a well crafted story with a core cast of well developed and well used characters.<br><br>But that's just my opinion. The series may just not be for you. To me it seems you're just lookingat it with an overly cynical eye, trying to find things not to like, but that's just my owm bias speaking. There's really no such thing as a perfect story that everyone likes, so if you just don't like it don't waste time dwelling on it.<br><br><br>Not really. One of Schierke's spells called on a spirit associated with battlefields and death I think, and there's Griffith's communion with the dead, and the effect the brand has on spirits, but no straight up raising a corpse army as of yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Borkoff is a neo hawk so yeah.<br><br>And it's possible other apostles sacrificed something not human. I think the only real requirement is that it has to be of great value to you. Something that's like cutting out a part of yourself and offering it up.<br><br>That said, humans have been involved in every sacrifice. Even Egg's "world" included the people gathered at Albion in the deal. Though none of them were branded directly, they were indirectly sacrificed.<br><br>Ganishka sacrificed his son whom he barely knew, but I think he still loved his son as he saw a lot of himself in him (which is partly why he feared him.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judging that last we heard they were making great headway toward Skellig Isle thanks to their mermaid escort, I'd say so.</br>  Humans and apostles working together under Griffith just pissed me the fuck off and made me hate that retard Sonia. Jesus Christ, I want Sonia to try and lecture Guts and he just gives her a backhand.It'll probably be Scheirke to do that anyway. I just want pages of Guts fucking shit up and everyones jaws dropping because of a human swordsman doing this. I just love that shit.<br><br>God it pissed me off. Apostles are fucking evil pieces of shit that lust for human blood. How does Griffith plan to suppress that? Just kill every apostle? We have never seen a Godhand kill an apostle have we? Ganishka wasnt really killed per se was he? I wonder what the policy is with Godhand and dealing with apostles. Apostles can kill apostles but are Godhand allowed to kill apostles? I really wonder how apostle transformations will work now that the Godhand are in the world. Just create a separate dimension for it to be done?</br></br>  <br>Apostles aren't mindless.monsters. They are capable of holding back. Many have even been shown capable of love, happiness, regret and compassion and a whole LOT of fear. They aren't rabid beasts, they're more like sociopaths.<br><br>Keeping them in line shouldn't be too hard. You just have to establish a power structure and give them something to fear. They rightly fear Femto and see him as their patron and God. Not only that, but the most loyal apostles are also the strongest. You saw what Zodd did to Wyald. Apostles fear death and openly defying Godhand Femto is too dangerous to do on a whim.<br><br>With that in mind, he is also placating their lust for violence with a gladiatorial arena for them to fight and rip and tear and soak in the suffering.<br><br>I imagine those that just aren't fit to hang out in Falconia are sent off on missions outside of Falconia often, much as Wyald was kept busy in other lands and remote areas when he bent knee to Midland as a knight.<br><br>That answer your question?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could be. If there's an assault on Elfhelm I'm also sure Zodd would be part of it. He's always involved in the critical missions.<br><br><br>I also think there will also be another huge battle as epic and massive as the final Ganishka battle, this time involving the astral creatures in Fantasia. <br><br>I don't quite see Guts leading such an army though, doesn't seem his thing. One thought that occurred to me is that just maybe the SkullKnight might. He seems to have a bigger connection, however strong with the astral ever since the days he was alive. He used the Berserk armor created by dwarves; he knows quite well the Elf king and elven places in general; and Flora was for him much like Shierke is to Guts, so another window to understand the astral. He seems more aligned for such a task all things considerd me thinks.<br><br> Hawk Lancers riding tamed griffons with a flying apostle captain, backed up by human archers and perhaps a sorcerer or two calling the spirits of the fallen to attack directly or possess footsoldiers to empower them. Shit's gonna be legendary. <br><br>I think Zodd would possibly lead a flying apostle force, much like he did against Ganishka in Vritannis. He's the strongest flying apostle after all. As for necromancers, while not necessarily as in the art of ressurecting or summoning the undead, on the second chapter of the manga we see Guts battling dead corpses, but just possessed by wicked spirits it seems. Just similar effect. Also, skeletons raised in Fantasia (pic related).<br><br>Personally, I'd like to see Locus and his demon Lancer division pitted on the battlefield against an equal number of awesome Dullahan lancer knights, like this guy in the same pic. Btw, is there anyone else who also wants this same guy to become an actual character in the story?<br><br>And REAL dragons against the flying apostles, while Irvine and his Archer division try to shoot them down from the ground in a massive chaos fuck. Hell yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, fuck apostles. I want Guts to rip them to shreds and stick the DS up their ass.</br>  <br>Also Ganishka was most certainly killed, though not directly by Femto. The wings of darkness manipulated spacetime and redirected the Skull Knight's slash to split Ganishka's vulnerable human core in two. There's no two ways about it, the Kushan Emperor is dead.<br><br>I don't know if the Godhand can execute apostles as they wish. I would assume so, as I've seen nothing to suggest otherwise. Apostles are.told to do as they will, I would assume it's much the same for the angels of the Godhand, except they are usually locked in the nexus and their ability to directly influence the mortal realm is limited.<br><br>Also I would assume the Godhand can still be summoned. the behelit should still work. I wouldn't be surprised if they can even be two places at once.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but he isnt DPS, he is engineer type support. he will increase dps of other team members</br>  I suppose the chapter isn't translated yet, right? I was hoping it gets updated over night.  <br><br>No, i can't into moonrunes. I'll wait for a translation.</br></br>  Griffith did  <br>He can use some of the weapons he himself created too, like the repeating crossbow.</br>  <br>nothing wrong</br>    I want to see guts fight an apostle/human so fucking jacked on drugs and having a sheer amount of hatred towards him<br><br>the closest that comes to this was the slug apostle giga nigger minion but I dont feel it had the good feeling that comes from fighting someone insane</br></br>  translation when  I like that Miura cares about his characters and Berserk isn't full of pointless deaths. In almost every other manga an apostle transformation would be a death flag, but not in Berserk. I remember my first reaction to the fight with Zodd.<br><br> oh, so he is some strong warrior and Guts will defeat him, it's obvious <br> Zodd transforms <br> Well fuck, Griffith's and Guts will kill him to show how powerful they are <br> Zodd slaps their shit and spared them only because of the behelit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sonia to try and lecture Guts and he just gives her a backhand <br>God that would feel good.</br></br>  I am the only one here who roots for GutsxPuck?  <br>It's already up</br>  <br>that's because you're a faggot</br>  <br>can't find it anywhere</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128562831 <br>rude tbh</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128562831 <br>why u do this tho</br>  <br>http://imgur.com/a/K8IXE</br>  <br>Hahaha! What a great story Mark.</br>  <br>or rickert will watch them fill it with napalm and send it out to the battlefield against guts</br>  <br>meh i'll just wait until a non-duwang one appears</br>  Can someone explain something to me? Why does the beast of darkness want Guts to kill Caska exactly? <br><br>What I'm getting is that Guts was so bent on revenge he left Caska the love of his life alone to pursue Griffith, and when he realizes that while killing Griffith and getting revenge is important that his love for Caska is even more important. Then after settling his mind a little bit and deciding to put revenge on the backburner, he finally gets the chance to kill Griffith.<br><br> The beast of darkness,who is the darkness in Guts' soul urges him to kill Caska, because Caska isn't the same woman he fell in love with and that secretly (maybe closer to intrusive thoughts) he only sees her as a reminder of why he hates Griffith and why revenge is important? <br><br>I got that pretty close I think but it all seems kind of hazy with these weird translations</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Caska is the human part of Guts's soul and his past.<br><br>Removes that and Guts becomes full time killing machine.</br></br></br>  <br>Which will implicitly allow him to strike down Griffith and get the revenge he wants?</br>  <br>Yes, but all the beast wants is Guts's full commitment to killing anyway.</br>  <br>That's what I assumed, thank you for clearing it up, while the official translations are good, some stuff is a little weird still. That was the only thing that was really hard to understand though. Thank you c:</br>  <br>I loved it since I first saw the picture. I loved it day -1. Keep up the good work anon.</br>  <br>Guts has to slay at least a dragon. The fucking sword is called Dragonslayer.</br>  <br>Grunbeld will be that dragon.</br>  <br>Schierke should have brown or auburn hair. The green just doesnt fit.</br>  <br>Nah. The rematch between guts and zodd was better by miles.</br>  <br>that would be sum neat poetry son</br>  <br> n-no <br><br><br>I think the natural hair colors just fit the universe.</br></br></br></br>  What is /ber/ reading/watching currently?<br><br>I am, in fact, reading Attack on Titan. It's a very epic, superb manga with a tone closer to Berserk than most manga out there.<br><br>I've also taken a liking to watching Ninja Slayer and Dragon Ball Super weekly because of their flashy combat and jaw-dropping animation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't start studying it then? <br>You fucking manchild</br></br>  <br>The beast is his hatred given thought. It wants to kill and remove casca as guts' top priority.</br>  <br>I'm reading Tokyo Ghoul and watching F/SN  with friends </br>  Will we ever see him again?  <br><br> Ganiska <br> Sane <br><br>Uh, he was as blood thirsty as The Count but on a scale so much higher.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since were talking about this, can someone give me a reason to get back into claymore? I loved it at first but then they started focusing on bullshit power levels too much and the action just got stale with the flashy bleach tier action. Otherwise its been good. But shits starting to feel stale.</br>  <br> Though none of them were branded directly, <br><br>There was a giant sacrifice symbol created there, remember? It covered the entire field.</br></br></br>  <br>Reading up on Kingdom<br><br>So much shit has happened since I dropped it.</br></br></br>  <br> he makes a device for pre-spinning and launching guts into battle like a disc battler </br>  <br>I've only seen the anime, liked the start but as it progressed it became very stale like you said. I have little interest in reading the manga after seeing the ending.</br>  <br>Considering  Gravity Falls  and I plan on distracting myself with endless vidya. The more I play (Especially since JRPGs can last me 50+ hours at minimum) the less I'll think of Berserk and it will make the wait for chapters ache less.<br><br>Even waiting for a series weekly can run me dry since I hate 10 pages of nothing after a cliff hanger or something.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't know if the Godhand can execute apostles as they wish. <br><br>Femto accidentally killed a few and didn't seem to care during The Eclipse when he did some energy ball at Guts or Skull knight (forget which ) but it missed.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably, we'll see what's his relation is with the witch lady, Void and Zodd along with why he became  the Skull Knight. </br>  how can guts fight an entire army of monsters?<br>i think murata has written himself into a corner. He's going to need a huge asspull to get guts face 2 face with griffith.</br>  <br>Very recklessly</br>  <br> murata </br>  <br>he's  a half-apostle <br><br>also,<br> murata </br></br></br></br>  <br>You just saw him dunk like 4 apostles while wearing the berserker armor. I doubt he's going to fight every apostle in Falconia but he's well able to kill what gets in his way quite quickly.</br>  <br>Is this even debatable? Second place is Slan.</br>  <br>Guts will have to go berserk</br>  <br>But what if you had to only ever fuck her true form with all the vagina dicks and stuff?</br>  Lets talk about this badass right here /ber/.<br><br>How powerful do you think he is? Could he become guts' enemy? How hard of a motherfucker was he as a human?</br></br>  <br>I'd prefer they just wait until the manga is over (if it ever ends). Otherwise, the anime will just catch up with the manga, and they'll have to do some OC ending. It'll be the Japanese version of ASOIAF/GoT.<br><br>Not to mention, unless they release it as some kind of OVA series, it'll be censored to hell and back.</br></br></br>    <br> easily avoidable situations plays out so stupidly <br><br>Going to need some specifics here.</br></br></br>  <br> anime <br> catch up with the manga <br> 337 chapters </br></br></br>  <br>The anime ending never happens in the manga though. The problem is the power levels brought into fights, otherwise everything else is great.</br>  <br>He was proto-Griffith</br>  <br>I JUST fucking realized that he uses his antlers as a bow. That makes so much more sense.</br>  <br>There are near none. Anon is too into stupid moeshit or is just baiting.</br>  <br>His power is probably about equal with one of the god hand.<br>I don't see him becoming Guts' enemy any time soon.<br>He was probably on part with Guts as a human (they both used the berserker armor)</br></br></br>  <br>At leadt he didnt sacrifice his friends. At least hes loyal to his remaining ones.</br>  <br>You're implying it wouldn't, at the pace that chapters have been releasing for the last few years? Even if it sticks with a monthly release schedule from here until the end, it's still going to take forever.</br>  <br>are you stupid?</br>  Would there be a worse fictional world to live in than Berserk? Aside from outright apocalyptic stories, I can't think of any other fictional universes where your average person is more fucked, and it seems to get progressively worse with each successive arc.  <br> Would there be a worse fictional world to live in than Berserk? <br>I'm sure that we all know the answer.</br></br>  <br>potentially</br>  <br>Let's say the anime manages to turn 4 chapters of manga into one episode of anime. That leaves about 84 episodes of anime, which would be about six seasons assuming an average of 13 episodes per season. Assuming each season takes half a year to make, that's about three years, just for what is already written.</br>  <br> "Finally Guttsu-san, you have become Beruserkuruâ¢" <br> "After I deal with these faggot-ass monsters, I'm coming for you, Griffisu!" </br></br>  <br>there are several.</br>  <br><br>Griffith's plan better not be the same as the ending to Full Metal Alchemist whereby the entire country is secretly a giant brand and he was luring everybody there to sacrifice them for even more power or some other retarded nonsense.</br></br>  <br>okay so then assuming it is updateing monthly for those 3 years (which won't happen) then we have 10 or so more episodes worth of manga by then and then it's caught up</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128568292 <br> Aside from outright apocalyptic stories <br>Whoops, my reading comprehension kinda died.</br></br>  <br>Falconia was his goal. I doubt he wants to sacrifice it.</br>  <br> I don't know if the Godhand can execute apostles as they wish. <br><br>Femto killed Apostles on whim after he transformed in the eclipse trying to stop Skull Knight.

The whole area was branded and thus they were indirectly included in that.</br>  <br>Considering how she has sex with her disciples every single night, probably yes.<br><br> Octa explains having sex with faeries even though they have no genitalia <br> Puck exists <br> my sides when people ship Puck with Guts </br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck Griffith.  <br>2pure</br>  <br>On top of the fact that Guts also ignored him sometimes to fight other apostles.</br>  I feel like berserk is getting to big for its self and the end is way far in sight. I really hope this isn't going to be a gantz situation.  <br>Gantz used to be one of my favorites, could you refresh my memory on what happened that made its ending so bad?<br><br>I was took issue with the ending on a thematic level, but what with respect to the actual series of events was it that pissed people off?</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder he sold his boipussy to a fat noble for money</br>  dont kill me for this but i have to ask:<br>Is there a colored version of the manga?<br>I watched the anime, liked it and tried to read the manga in black and white, but i cant make out what the fuck is happening. im serious</br></br>  <br>I'm glad you love it, anon.</br>  <br>Manga (in general) isn't colored. Deal with it.</br>  <br>It was for a higher cause. So it's ok.</br>  <br> it was for a higher cause <br>Yeah, it was necessary for him to become a godhand. How much of Griffith's success was due to fate? His life should have ended during his encounter with Zodd.<br><br>But it didn't. He was fated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's like asking "how much of Guts' physical strength was due to fate?". Fucking pointless.</br>  <br>get better eyes, faggot</br>  <br>Kingdom any good?</br>  <br>Where'd he get the magic horse?</br>    <br>It's definitely not pointless in a universe where Guts is literally outside of the bounds of causality.</br>  <br>Muv luv unlimited, Casshern SIns.</br>  <br> Griffith being the Good buy <br> Prophecy: "When the Sun has died five times, a red lake will appear at the West of the city with a name both new and ancient, and it will be the sign that the fifth angel, the Falcon of Darkness, is born. The Angel shall be both master of the sinful black sheep and king of the blind white ones. He is the one who shall bring an age of darkness upon the world." </br></br>  <br> that bulge </br>  If anyone ever decided to attempt adapting Berserk into an anime once more, and going beyond the goddamn golden age, I only have a single request. <br><br>Call it a beggars wish.<br><br><br>It's that  è±æ¾¤ é¦è  voices Schierke.</br></br></br></br></br>  How much more enjoyable would it be if the Skull Knight came out of a gap in space-time and brought with him the God Emperor of Mankind, who then bestows upon Guts everything needed to become a SPEHS MUHREEN?  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>That's one of the coolest monster designs in Berserk, and probably that i've ever seen.</br>   It's time.   Time for what?  <br>hardcore gay sex</br>  Not yet.  What a great week it has been  Hype.  <br>Too bad the anime sucks compared to the manga</br>  <br>it couldn't possibly live up to the standards of the manga</br>  <br>It's literally a 1:1 adaption. The only downside is that its pace is too fast</br>  <br>They're not leaving anything out and now we get to hear the jokes which makes them even funnier, why are you all complaining about. The shower scene was ten times funnier than it was in the manga</br>  <br>The art is ugly (what's with the colors?), the animation is low quality, the voice actors they picked spend all their time yelling, and yeah the pacing is way too fast</br>  <br> what's with the colors? <br>Why you want every single anime to look the same? I think it's refreshing and it goes well with the realistic style. About the rest of your statements, you must be trolling.</br></br>  Stop arguing and let's talk about what really matters: would you?  <br>Not for Gakuto it hasn't.</br>  <br>It objectively looks like shit, go ask /ic/. The shading especially is so bad I feel sick</br>  <br>No</br>  nth for Poor Killua, he was born to suffer   gintoki and hijikata <br> laughing like this with each other <br>Why do I feel like crying?  Are they really leaving? ;_; </br></br>    Didn't we just have a thread? Oh well  <br>My dick feels very good about it</br>  <br>You don't need to love someone to give him a good dicking though.</br>  The last thread was merely some days ago, what the hell? Can't we just decide to have a specific day of the week for this?<br>I'll just leave this here and go away</br>  <br><br> le funny misunderstanding homo joke </br></br>  <br>Is it bad that I really, really want Suna to have a gay crush on Takeo.

Yeah, after the last two episodes I have a strong feeling Suna is going to end up with Saijou</br>  <br>Don't trust Gorilla, there have been to many fake outs this arc, they'll be back eventually, probably to swoop in at the last minute to save Gintoki and crew from something.</br>  <br>Things were different during CLAMP's golden days</br>  <br>Do they even draw new stuff anymore?</br>  <br>That's because girls are into turbohomos, so you can't go wrong with straight turbohomos in shoujo manga</br>  <br>xxxHOLiC: Rei recently came back then when went immediately back to hiatus</br>  <br><br> What are you talking about? We had one on Wednesday and one today. It's been Wednesday/Saturday for months now.  <br><br><br>This page and the salutes in this and the last chapter really hit me hard.<br><br> tfw when your husbando get's a manga canon arc focused on him only to get fucked over multiple times, scarred and then he fucks off to god knows where. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe I watched the entire CCS series when I was little without noticing how gay these two were. Was I that stupid?</br>  <br> every time they got interrupted by Ruby Moon in S2 </br>  <br>Oh? Last thread felt way more recent than that, but I guess that's just me then.

I'm not really interested in swordboys, but it spells good things for the industry. Plus, Alter might deliver some more Tales characters or other Altair figures. And, like I said, I'm always interested in seeing the GKs, even if I can't have them. Companies might pick up popular GKs as well.</br>    <br><br>I had no idea about that, sorry.
