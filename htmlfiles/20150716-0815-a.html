[  (((( ;°Д°)))) <br> /ai/ - Idle Activities </br>  The guide: http://pastebin.com/iDebHQu6  First in passion, you say?  <br>First in something.</br>  I need to catch up with Aikatsu has anything cool happened?  <br>Just Miyabi becoming best girl.</br>    Official PP stamps to commemorate the 1 year anniversary.<br>Can't imagine what you would use them for.</br>  <br><br>That part was adorable, she really looks like she's enjoying herself</br></br>      <br>units and everyone being cute</br>  <br>see <br>In short, this is a thread (read: general) for all shows and things with a target demographic of little girls.</br></br>    I miss Aikatsu so I think I'm going to have to pick it back up later today.  bump <br><br>I'm currently on episode 137.</br></br>   Boring episode. I don't like the Jalapeños at all. <br>And yet again they made Juri wear something that doesn't suit her.<br><br>This thing was cute though.</br></br></br>  Ah a newspaper dress.  I want to fuck Lala.  <br>Me too dude.</br>  <br>Stamp Lala's face on my cheek</br>  <br>God damn, Pink is so sexy.</br>  <br>Shion is very pretty.</br>    <br>pretty dead</br>  <br>Long haired Shion was great.<br> Short hair still cute. </br></br>  <br> loli Shion <br>I had completely forgotten.</br></br>  <br>Why, thank you.</br>  <br> candlejack jokes </br>    Feels like it might be about time for the plot to kick in now. I'll have to start avoiding posting spoilers.    <br>I wanna fuck this little faggot.</br>    How many people watch Aikatsu raw and how many wait for subs? It kind of feels like half and half so there's hardly ever a big discussion of anything.  <br>Since it airs at 5am my time, and Mezashite usually gets subs out within 3-5 days, I usually wait and watch it subbed.</br>  <br>I watch subbed, but sometimes I end up letting episodes stack up for a few weeks before I catch up.</br>  <br>I used to try to catch the livestream and download the .ts if I missed it but I lost my cap source so I just waited for subs since they're out in a reasonable timeframe. I refuse to watch Ohys and there's no decent raw groups for Aikatsu so the Mezashite encode is the only way.<br>I say used to because at some point (ep 133 judging by my text file) I got too pissed of by Madoka so I stopped watching and considered dropping Aikatsu altogether, but I'll catch up some day soon probably.<br>If I do end up dropping it that means no more BDs bought by me, but since another person on /ai/ has buying/uploading covered for now it's not the end of the world.<br>Now why the fuck did I write so much... I'll get back to finishing JPMC 02 now I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you have against Madoka?</br>  <br>Weird, I haven't seen anyone complain about Madoka since before she even joined the shows. A certain group of people thought she would be boring  and were then BTFO , but then she turned out to be a fun, honest, teasing little devil that loves her Akari-senpai.</br>  <br><br>I honestly can't remember exactly what I had against her as this was 2 months ago, but she ticked me off for some reason and made it not fun to watch Aikatsu!, which is a terrible thing to do.<br>I'll give it a try again soon and it will probably be resolved as she's probably not going to tick me off again.<br> I might've been under quite a bit of stress at the time and my mental well-being is always shaky when that happens especially now that I'm not taking antidepressants any more. </br></br></br></br>  <br>133 was when Madoka first showed some real weakness, and had to overcome her fear and face her grandmother to get a premium dress. I guess only you can know why you didn't like it.</br>  <br>I'll rewatch 133 right now to see if I was just really fucked up at the time.</br>  Behead those who insult Madoka.  <br> implying that I didn't dropped it already   sometimes I wonder why I still hang around </br>  <br>I haven't watched since halfway through S2, but I still keep up with the music and performances  because I honestly believe Aikatsu has the best music out of idol anime and love the CG. </br>  <br><br>What the hell are you doing guys, Aikatsu is better than ever right now.</br></br>  Why is Akari so  insane ?  <br>Me three.</br>  <br>You might like her this time around. I personally found her to be quite endearing in 133.</br>  <br>I don't have the motivation, I'm over 60 episodes behind at this point.</br>  <br><br><br>Okay rewatched it and it was fine, not entirely sold on Madoka but wasn't as terrible as I thought at the time at least.<br>I guess I'll catch up till 141 tonight since I have the time anyway.<br> Given that my mental health affected my enjoyment this much it does mean that I care a lot about Aikatsu! since other shows weren't affected this much. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what the hell are you doing <br>Waiting for Banruse to stop being assholes</br></br>  <br> You don't have time until you finish working on MC </br>  <br>Is that a panty shot?</br>  <br> It's why I said tonight okay, it's only 17:10 here... </br>  <br>It needs 100% more Ichigo though.</br>  <br>what should I make mine say? I'm thinking just かしこまっ! but maybe it would be better as a lewder message</br>  Ded Pirates    NOW IT FLIES TOO?<br>This fucking skateboard...<br><br> she really is </br></br></br>    <br>Raw, Aikatsu is the only show I care enough about to watch the livestream  despite having to stay up until 3AM for it. </br>  <br>Hinaki and Sumire go away.</br>  Can I just skip the second season of Aikatsu  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You'll miss a lot of good stuff, including Akari's introduction.</br>  <br>No. Did you even try? It's certainly better when you don't have to wait weekly. There are some good episodes in the first half, and the second half is required viewing if you want to watch S3 and the movie.</br>  I think I'll keep this for future use  <br>But he would be spared of the dreadful DreAcas stealing screentime, auditions, and constellation dresses from the superior girls.</br>  <br><br>It isn't THAT bad but it is a bit boring compared to the first season. You'd need to see Akari's episodes at least, and I think the season gets a little better once they stop doing the whole tie thing - around when Mizuki makes her return and introduces her partner.<br><br>Your enjoyment/tolerance of Season 2 would probably depend on which of the Dream Academy girls you like. If you like Kii, you're in luck. If you like Maria, however, you're SoL. And I don't mean slice of life.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If you like Maria <br>There is anybody besides the little "I also want to be a princess" Japanese girls, who actually like Maria?</br></br>  <br>I like Maria. She's not close to my favourite or anything, but there's no reason to dislike her.</br>  <br>There's no reason to have any opinion on her. She may as well not exist.</br>  <br>That's kind of a negative and pointless opinion. She's there so that viewers can enjoy her, and in-universe she wants to be an idol and just so happens to be good at it. Thinking about it, she's kind of a perfected Fuwari, being an outdoors lighthearted girl but also a princess.</br>  <br>She literally did NOTHING, and had everybody else do stuff for her, while she was busy being cute.<br>Literally Maria Sue. And I don't like the way she got her constellation dress either.</br></br>  <br>It's fun when you take exactly the same screenshots I did.</br>  <br>Those three were really fucking cute.</br>    <br>Somebody set us up the bomb.</br>  <br>I think I've experienced too much Plutia... now I kinda wanna go bully those cut innocent little girls.</br>   you came to the wrong neighborhood puri   <br>It's less the bikini and more the style. Dorothy's is really racy for a 13-year-old and she's posed like a slut. Shion's would probably be okay if they didn't choose the absolute lewdest wrap thing configuration to make it look like she's wearing nothing at all underneath.</br>  <br>I agree with the little girls. This kind of stuff should be left to fanartists.</br>    Alright I just hit the end of the third cour of kira deco. Only 13 episodes left. I'll finish it off tomorrow. Probably.   Spanish and Mexican Cuisine has a deep connection. <br><br>1. A Spaniard is saying that.<br>2. ANYONE is surprised by that.<br><br>The tortilla factoid was pretty interesting though.</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=knz<wbr>UzruxDG0</wbr>  [ ]  <br> So  from  now  on  we're   Prizmmy </br>  <br>EVERY fucking time.</br>  <br>Reina still sounds like the most feminine one.</br>  <br>I don't even know how I messed up those spoilers. Oh well.</br>  <br>I've done the same thing  with the exact same quote  before. I think it doesn't like it when there are no spaces between the tags.</br>  ALIVE    <br>The red-eyed demon is so beautiful.</br>  What are they watching? It looks lewd, going by their faces.  <br>They're watching Skips, you can see it.</br>  <br>Yes, exactly what he said. Skips is lewd.</br>    Is there a stitch of Hinaki doing Juri's thing?  Passion Jalapeno are fucking gay.   <br>Oh, Mizuki has taken up Gardening? I wonder how she's doing in the Second Banana Independent Aikatsu business.</br>  <br>I think that's taken from an old poster.</br>  The one on the left looks like Wakana.  It really feels like some egg manufacturers have bought into Aikatsu. They've changed it so that little girls will remember to buy eggs in future.<br><br>Long-term marketing strategies like this must be risky.</br></br>  This was alright. Do Juri and Hinaki have the most songs of all the units this season? Three that they've performed together so far. <br><br>And with the next episode preview: will this mean that Yuu is coming back? Kokone has already stayed for several weeks longer than she was supposed to. And Miyabi is just hanging around.</br></br>  <br>Where's Mikuru?</br>  Miyabi a cute.<br>A CUTE</br>  <br>Putting the last touches on the garden I presume?</br>    <br>Who left that kiss mark?</br>      puri  So I said I would catch up to Aikatsu, so I'm working on that.<br>134 - Okay I might've had a wrong idea about Madoka that was somehow amplified the wrong way in 133 causing me to stop watching altogether... I actually like her now after watching this episode I guess.<br>135 - For this new character we took a squirrel and modelled a human after it... And it actually worked I guess.</br></br>  <br>I'd pop-step-get her pregnant.</br>  <br>squirrels are cute shit dude</br>    <br>Rude.</br>    <br>136 - The return of Miyabi, still one of the cutest idles around. <br>I'm guessing nobody redid this stitch yet (haven't bothered checking the last 4 weeks of threads), so I'll be doing that when I get my BDs in a few days (and I guess that also includes the 2 Ran stitches from 125).<br><br><br>They sure are.<br><br>I really like squirrels okay, it wasn't my intention to sound rude...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have that UR.</br>  <br>We can be choco squirrel buddies</br>  Stop saying gracias.  <br>Siento, tsumari gomen.</br>  <br> SkipS goes up against the best duos <br> Goes commando <br> Wins <br><br>Passion Japapeno should have gone bottomless to compete.</br></br></br></br></br>    Akari thighs.   Won by half a percentage point <br> Clear leader of the pack <br><br>THE FIX IS IN</br></br></br>  <br> They were the leaders/on top <br> It was clear from the points <br>Yes, and?</br></br></br>  <br>Must lick.</br>    ded    <br>Well I caught up so here's some thoughts I wrote down in my notebook... Why do I even bother...<br>137 - It sure would suck if holding my breath didn't work to solve hiccups since it's probably the most convenient method.<br>It looked like she might not have held it for long enough though, perseverance is important.<br><br>138 - Well this rating system makes about as much sense as fan calls in DMF so I'm not sure how accurate it is (the small difference they needed to win might not be significant enough).<br>Overall I think the execution of this unit cup was nice, limiting to 2 performances/ep and having backstage shenanigans makes for a nice format.<br>I don't really have much of an opinion on the results, but they were okay I guess.<br><br>139 - MISUNDERSTANDINGS, oh well Johnny was cute as hell and the OTP of Bepp x Gakuen Mother seems to be accurate.<br>Also hey Dreaca exists and I don't mind seeing Seira any more so that's an improvement.<br>And that was a cute scene with Sena and Akari.<br>Song was nice too, I usually like it when it's not generic idol stuff.<br>Also I guess Miyabi is still around for now.<br><br>140 - Play episode, not much to write about, but well executed.<br>I liked the cuts to the audience with Johnny theories.<br>Also I'd just like to add that Miyabi was once again the cutest, but that's not much of a competition when she's around.<br><br>141 - Lol Aikatsu 8. Nice slightly terrifying mascot character.<br>It's good to see Hinaki doing more things I guess.<br>And I guess they're keeping Miyabi around until Kokone leaves? I don't remember if they actually mentioned the duration of her stay at some point.<br><br>Anyway with that I'm caught up and I can once again state that it's one of the more enjoyable shows I watch, I was wrong to consider dropping it after 133.<br><br>tl;dr: Johnny was cute, but Miyabi was the cutest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        dedXded  <br>Kyupikon!</br>    /ai/ needs something to give it some life  Miyutan!  <br>What the...how do I make MPC make screenshots the right resolution?</br>  <br>Miyu and Himika do things to my pripara.</br>  <br>Don't use anamorphic video or use mpv.<br><br>I don't think there is a way for MPC to play nice with anamorphic video.</br></br></br>      <br>Rainbow Live: After Story</br>  <br>I want to fuck Mirei.</br>    <br>Rainbow Live: Dear My Future</br>    It's all downhill from here. Time to finish kira deco probably.    http://doki.co/2015/07/15/pripara-5<wbr>1/</wbr>  Best comedian ever.  I want to feel refreshed too.  <br>I want to fuwari Fuwari's non-existent fuwaris.</br>  <br>Me too</br>  <br>I want Fuwari to milk me using her bare feet.</br>  Well fuck    ded     Vampire butt    https://nekketsunikki.wordpress.co<wbr>m/2015/07/15/pretty-rhythm-rainbow-<wbr>live-anime-official-guide-book-toma<wbr>tsu-haruka-bell-interview/</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br>Bell interview was translated I guess.</br>   Literal semen demon   <br> Who would you go out with <br> Hijiri <br>Perfect taste</br></br></br>    Please tell me that's a typo and not an actual thing  And now I finally know where this came from  <br>/pc/scum ruined a perfect thread again...</br>  <br>You're their senpai,right? Take responsibility.</br>  <br> In the scene when she flung around Naru chan’s hand too, when watching that part I felt like « wah, Bell is scary ! »  <br>I had the same reaction.</br></br>     your waifu will never blast you with a pink beam <br><br>Why live?</br></br>   Talk about Chekhov's gun... Or chekhov's decostone as the case may be   <br>The thread is perfect only because you're here, senpai!</br>  And with that I've finished Kira Deco.<br>I'm still not sure what the fuck I just watched though.<br>All those twists and turns in the final couple of episodes, it took a while but shit did finally get real.<br> Coal's chaos dunk was simulatneously hilarious and awesome as a heroic sacrifice <br><br>Subs made my head hurt at some points, but I can't complain too much, because I could just turn them off if they were that bad.<br><br>Peridot is now my favourite jewelpet.<br><br>And I think it'll be a while before I watch another JP series.

A Reona would be fine too.   <br>Not specifically.<br>You'd have to make it from existing parts like .</br></br>  <br> spoiling the color of her panties <br><br>Goddamn it, now I have no reason to buy Lala</br></br></br>   Okay no more from me    /aai2/   <br/>  <br><br><br>The Ichigo I have does not have the ribbon in game but I think it looks more like her than these two.<br><br>Also, someone needs to make a Mirei and upload her to the database.</br></br></br></br></br>   Love Love Minky Momo   <br>What qualifies as useful?</br>  <br>But I thought everyone on /a/ was a cute little girl?</br>  <br>Doesn't that make it all the better that we have a thread about things for us?</br>  Who is the most overrated Anime studio?  Studios I don't like  They made that Manabi Straight show, didn't they?<br><br>That was a cute series.</br></br>  KyoAni  Actually Sunrise.  KyoAni  SHAFT<br><br>Trash animation but disguised as "style".<br><br>Kinda like Apple in computing world, "It's a feature. :^)"</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nobody cares about Ufotable outside Type Moon stuff.<br><br>  Madhouse or Ghibli </br></br></br></br>  <br>You cant overrate Sunrise, since without Sunrise there would not be modern anime industry in first place.<br><br>Sunrise, Toei and TMS ARE the anime. The rest are small parazites eating the food remainders of sharks.</br></br></br>  <br>   Ghibli <br>Nigga, I will cut you</br></br>  Trigger. This entire board was seriously saying they would save anime for months on end.  <br>Its a meme, is not supposed to be taken seriously. Of course everyone knows Yamakan is the only true savior of anime.</br>  <br> damage control <br>Just admit you were wrong about KlK being amazing.</br></br>  <br> Its a meme <br>sure faggot</br></br>  <br>shaft, they are horrible outside fanservise remains</br>  <br> Madhouse <br>They're done some garbage but it's hard to ignore all the good stuff they've made too.</br></br>    pa works  <br><br>Actually taking something like "saving anime" (What does anime need saving from to begin with?<br>How can a single show save anything?) seriously is retarded. <br>I'm seriously surprised anyone remotely intelligent can think "saving anime" is anything more than a joke</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean to quote you<br>I wanted to quote </br></br>  <br> nobody cares about Ufotable outside Type Moon stuff <br>Then why is God Eater getting so much shitposting if nobody cares because it's not TM? Doesn't all the shitpsting mean people care about Ufotable outside TM adaptations?<br>Because GE is an adaptation of a videogame by Bandai Namco</br></br></br>  <br>that sounds overrated</br>  Kyoani or Shaft  Pretty much Shaft. They just produce shit and some faggots pretend it's deep.  I'd say Trigger, people suck their dicks constantly but really the only truly notable thing they've done is LWA. Not saying their other stuff is bad - I'm a fan - but it's not enough to warrant the dick riding. <br><br><br><br><br>Say what you will about the shows themselves, but for those who like them KyoAni delivers with an exceptionally high standard of quality.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but KyoAni fans never approach it like how you're describing. They consistently posture those shows as the best of the season. That implies that the studio makes the best shows and they don't, anymore at least.</br>  Studio Ghibli  <br>TRIGGER, GAINAX and SHAFT.</br>    <br>I'll forgive madhouse pretty much anything for their work on the Satoshi Kon movies.</br>  <br>Thread over</br>  Kyoani<br><br>Same show again and again. Same faces again and again.<br><br>Garbage studio for plebs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Becuase it is a fact that every signle KyoAni show except for 2 of them were AOTS if not AOTY. There is no need to beat around the bush when you are stating facts.</br>  <br>Honestly I think they deserve the praise they get.</br>  <br> Boring CGDCT SOLcrap <br> AOTS or even AOTY <br>Hilarious. <br>They're shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, yeah they constantly make my favourite shows for whatever season they're in, so I'd say they make some of the best. <br><br><br>As far as highly praised studios go, I think Ghibli most deserves it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but for those who like them KyoAni delivers with an exceptionally high standard of quality </br>  <br>Sure if you're a /v/ermin you won't like CGDCT. But anon KyoAni didn't only do that. They had Key, Haruhi and Free. All objective AOTS.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116104 <br> tbh <br><br>Kill yourself and then take your corpse back to /sp/</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128116104 <br>You think I care what a /v/ermin says? It is an undoutable undeniable fact that every KyoAni show is AOTS when it airs. If you want to say no give an example shitposter-kun.</br>  <br>Is that even an /sp/ thing? I see it on /int/ more often than any other board  tbh </br>  <br>Thought it was a /mu/ and /p/ meme  tbh. </br>  <br>tbh I thought it was /mu/</br>  <br><br>You really need to pick up your game m8</br></br>  Ufotable<br>Shaft<br>Trigger<br>Modern Gainax</br></br></br>  Kyoani make some pretty decent stuff but they always play it too safe and just stick to doing really similar series. I like them but I wish they would try something different.    <br><br>Kyoani  tbh </br></br>  <br>You know KyoAni wouldn't include 30 sec stills don't you? And be honest.</br>  <br>While I really do love most of their shows, that's a reasonable criticism. They're clearly a technically talented studio, so I'd love to see them branch out a bit.</br>  <br>They did with KnK and it sold nearly nothing. It is clear that their fanbase wants one thing from them.</br>  <br>They would use lights moving arround and show somthing blurry in the background</br>  <br>In real life? Ghibli and Pierrot. On the anime portions of the web? KyoAni and ufo. Maybe Trigger, but at this point there's so much baiting from both sides that I can't even tell what anyone actually thinks about Trigger anymore.</br>  <br>You say that, but KnK was also one of their weakest shows. They need to try something new + have it be good to know whether or not it'll sell.</br>  <br> Trigger is a meme. Trigger niggers were a reality back when LWA aired and everyone thought they were good. Years later and neo-Gainax is doing better shows than those who have left. <br><br>And it would look better than anything PA or Silver Link ever produced.</br></br></br>  Why do so many people rush to defend Kyoani the second anyone makes fun of it?  <br>Because KyoAni is literally the best studio in the industry. Only plebs can have a bad opinion on based Kyoto Animation.</br>  <br>I like KyoAni.</br>  <br>I'd say PA's best stuff generally looks better than KyoAni's aesthetically (KyoAni wins animation).<br><br><br>People rush to defend almost any studio if it gets made fun of.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Satelight</br>  <br>I don't know anon. NagiAsu had amazing backgrounds but nothing they made looks as good as Hyouka.</br>  <br>Then tell me, why do people shitpost about decent studios?</br>  A1  <br>Uchoten Kazoku was gorgeous.<br><br><br>Because people rush to defend it the second anyone makes fun of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They made a few memorable anime that happens to be some people's favorites, such as K-On or Haruhi. So they get really defensive when you criticize the studio.<br>Some of the things they make are good (K-On, Nichijou, Tamako, Amagi) while some are terrible (Air, Kanon, Hibike) just like any other studio.</br></br>  <br>Why do people shitpost about decent anime?</br>  <br>Because of their obvious flaws</br>   anyone saying Trigger <br>Trigger has a very niche fanbase. If anything, its vastly underrated.<br>They also saved anime.</br></br>  <br> Kanon <br> Air <br> Bad <br>Are you sure you're not talking about the movies anon? Because they were some really nice adaptations.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll bite; Euphonium was hardly a masterpiece but it was certainly good. What makes you say it was terrible?</br>  <br> This is what Trigger Niggers actually believe. <br>How can you be so stupid and retarded?</br></br>  <br>Kekkai Sensen&gt; Euphonium<br>Garo&gt;Amagi</br></br>  <br>Did people like them? I thought they were pretty terrible. Maybe I was expecting too much since I watched Clannad first.</br>  <br>I haven't been on /v/, and I hate CGDCT SOLcrap<br>Stop forcing your boogeyman<br>And I'm <br>I was just replying to another part of your post</br></br></br></br>  <br> Gay Sensen better than anything <br> Gyaru : the non animation better than anything.  <br>Come on shitposter kun you really have to dig deeper.</br></br></br>  <br>If you like Key stories you'll like them. Especially Air was really enjoyable. Didn't really like how they portrayed the MC in Kanon. But they both were really solid.</br>  <br> kekkai sensen  <br>Bad writing, bad pacing, bad animation.

Businessmen in their forties will remember Sunrise due to the huge cultural impact of Gundam. The studio has also been the base in which a forth of current late night anime studios originated or worked for during their early days including Deen, Bones, A1, Manglobe and even Kyoani.</br>  <br>  gainax  </br>  <br>No one overrates them any more because everyone knows they have gone the way of Gonzo.</br>  <br>i dunno, do we count the major overrating of NGE and EoE or is that counted separately?</br>  <br>EoE was done by Production I.G</br>  <br>Kyoani</br>  <br> Gainax <br>Everyone knows it's just a shell at tis point</br></br>  <br> Shaft <br> Animation <br>should've just went with Ufotable/Madhouse/Bones if you really want to baiting.</br></br></br>  <br> implying I was baiting <br>Nisekoi was a lot more fun to watch based on animation than Hibike was.</br></br>  <br> shit story <br> barely passable as animation <br>2/10</br></br></br>  I hate SHAFT and their western fanbase so much.  <br> Not hating any kind of western fanbase </br>  <br>How could I hate /a/?</br>  <br>Are you implying that /a/ doesn't hate /a/?</br>  <br>What are you doing here?</br>  <br>how does one pronounce Ufotable?</br>  <br>Mappa</br>  <br>I hate you f/a/ggots less than other forum, I guess.</br>  <br> trigger niggers </br>  <br>But that is Toei anon.

The second they actually try to do something not TM related, it's a pile of shit and they're exposed for the hack studio they really are.

He's a total hack and should retire or stick to animation/visuals/direction.</br>  <br> their work looks off to me. <br>Personally I just think it looks boring.<br>They need to lay off the CG rotoscoping.<br>Same goes for Kyoani. It has nice shots, but still looks average aside from the random weird camera shots. I'd never watch a Kyoani or a Ufotable show because of their animation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>knk, tamako market, nichijou</br>  KyoAni.  <br>But Kyoani does use CG (like most studios nowadays) and CG rotoscoping.<br><br>Also, while Hibike was very nice, they've produced quite a few weaker shows recently.</br></br></br>  <br> Ufo  <br> CGI 24/7 <br> Implying GE is CGI outside of the aragamis (which need it, because it would be hard to get their detailed designs right otherwise)  <br> Implying judging an entire studio just because of one show isn't shitposting <br>Fuck off, retard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aragamis can't be handled without CG. <br>Yeah that's why mosters were never in anime before digital cels and CG right?<br>And honestly outside of F/Z and KnK #3,#5 everything they have done is the definition of mediocrity. Uninspired direction. Rehashed Soundtracks. Shitty studio overall. Such a shame that Hirao went there.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime is dead and was a mistake.</br>  <br> implying KnK movies aren't all great <br> implying UBW wasn't one of the best things of it's respective seasons <br>Nice shitpost<br>Nice shitpost</br></br></br></br>  <br> CG rotoscoping </br>  <br><br>here<br>Also, what I meant is that CG is the best option to handle the detailed designs of the aragami<br>2D would have to sacrifice details. The aragami are VERY detailed, and CG is the bestt way of not losing any of said details</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean you can have highly detailed hand drawn monsters. Check out any old movie or OVA and you'll see how it can be handled with good talent.<br>Also yeah if you enjoyed KnK#6 and UBW I have nothing to tell you other than get a better taste you fucking secondary.</br></br>  <br>Definitely Ufotable.</br>  <br> Secondary <br> Implying I didn't read F/SN before the anime and before watching Zero <br> Implying UBW wasn't the best adaptation of the source material we can hope to ever get <br> People need to get better taste becaue they enjoy things you don't  <br> Comparing movies and OVAs to TV anime, when movies and OVAs always get a higher budget, and are allowed more production time <br>What an awful shitpost</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean if UBW's adaptation was enough for you have some really shitty standards ufotable drone-kun.</br>  On /a/, Ufotable, mainly by newfags not understand how budget works or how studios make anime and only watched UBW without watching KnK movies.<br>Sunrise is underrated on /a/.<br><br>Shaft isn't overrated anymore on /a/, and KyoAni is just the victim of bait from both sides and loyal fanbase. They're both studios that are very similiar between their anime compared to other studios where it varies greatly. Generally being a fan of a studio is silly because the works they make are not consistent in a lot of ways.</br></br></br>  <br>It's you who have the needlessly high standards<br> Ufo didn't read my mind to replicate how the sceness go , so they're shit <br> Everyone who doesn't share my opinions has shitty standards <br>Can you please fuck off, you shitposter?<br>You tell me I'm a drone, but your blind hate is not any better than being a drone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>SHAFT, Kyoani and ufoTABLE in that order.</br></br>    <br><br>It's actually kind of true, but more accurately the other studios are just kind of small time and realistically everyone depends on Scamco and Jewplex to get by one way or another since their the only anime enterprises with any damn structure and horizontal/vertical integration.</br></br>  <br>Get out.</br>  KyoAni<br>Shaft<br>A-1 Pictures<br><br>I can name a few others but these studios above just pander with way too much mainstream appeal.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think people want to metaphorically hate fuck Scamco is what's going on. Love Live, Gundam, Tales and idolMASTER discussions are downright bipolar.</br></br>  <br>Toei has always, ALWAYS been shit. In the 80s Sunrise got their shit together, and a lot of their shows have fantastic animation (most recently G-reco)</br>  <br> mainstream appeal. <br>What?<br>None of those studios have mainstream appeal, and even considering the jumble that is A1 is retarded. KyoAni and Shaft pander mainly to otaku.<br><br>Sunrise and Toei are the mainstream studios.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;implying UBW wasn't one of the best things of it's respective seasons <br>But it wasn't.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12811405 <br>This.</br>  <br><br>It's more like every current Kyoani show is the greatest of all time to them. I actually recently started watching Hibike and while it's a little better than some of their recent stuff where it seemed like they barely gave a fuck, even with reserved expectations I still find myself disappointed in the characters. Still too moe blob like and overly cutesy, like far more than even your average moe anime. I'm not anti moe either, I don't even mind Jukki Hanadas work with Love Live, just something about how Kyoani does it feels like the gauges are turned up more than is necessary to find a character cute and quirky such that they come off annoying instead and it's always been like this for them. I'm almost tempted to say they're kind of bad at moe and try to make up for it with exaggerated character movements and face pulling which is why you have shows like that selling okay to the moe crowd, but not as well as say Love Live or other idol shows which have become all the rage now.</br></br>  <br> i'll keep saying they are shitposting,that will show them </br>  <br>K-On was incredibly well-recieved and had a very diverse audience</br>   people saying KyoAni   <br> LET SABER GO I don't care about the rest. <br><br>uhh, are you a wizard</br></br></br>  <br>But it was</br>  <br><br>Honestly why I find their fanbase hilarious at best to annoying at worst. They seem to be of the LOVE ME! and PAY ATTENTION TO ME! Where unless everyone accepts their point of view that everyone of their shows is the greatest thing ever than that just won't do and a deluge of shitposting to bury everyone and everything else must immediately commerce to force people to see "the way". It's very fanatical and childish and is really only rivaled by the Fate fanbases antics in recent times.</br></br>  <br> selling okay <br> but not as well as say Love Live <br><br>You have no clue what you're talking about.</br></br></br></br>  Say whatever you want about KyoAni, but no other studio would've taken the time or effort to animate the instruments in Hibike or the water in Free with as much detail as them. You may say that they don't take risks in their storytelling but financially they take huge risks by always looking to being innovative with their animation even if it might cost them some bucks. The only show you could say they cheaped out on since Nichijou is Amagi from all the stills and maybe Tamako Market. This alone makes them worthy of respect even if you despise their shows or their fanbase.  <br>That's true, I think it aired on Jap Disney Channel too, but if you look outside of that one exception (which was originally based on an otaku seinen manga and aired late at night), they're still very pandering to otaku. Free was fujoshi pandering, and they've done otaku LN 'adaptations' too.<br><br><br>I don't find KyoAni's stuff moe even if it intends to be. It feels too fake and lifeless to me, especially K-ON. <br><br><br>All fanbases are autistic and trying to generalize like this is silly as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No need to reply seriously to shitposts</br>  <br><br>A-1 only really has sales since they cherry pick already popular stuff, almost nobody anywhere really seems to like them anymore these days after they decided it was a great idea to ramp up production such that quality control is virtually nonexistent and they release crap adaptation after crappy adaptation and ruined sequels to quite a few popular franchises that other even smaller studios handled perfectly fine. These days they're only really popular with MAL and teenagers that like stuff like Aldnoah and SAO (not saying anything in particular about those shows, just most of the fanbase seems to be between the ages of 12-16) and even they're starting to learn after last season.<br><br>I'd say they're still overrated and get too much attention strictly on account of the licenses they manage to pick up, but they won't be for much longer if they continue to fuck them up and piss people off they'll be the new Deen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ufo.<br><br>They have the money but they lack the talent.</br></br></br>   No-one saying Bones <br><br>Just proves how overrated they are</br></br>  <br>Sure. You're not ignoring the fact that everyone on this board reacts that way.<br> that show was shit <br> no it was great you faggot <br> AOTS even <br><br>You're not much better than the people you're describing. KyoAni is popular on /a/ and they have always been one of the studios that gets attention. You're also ignoring the fact that anti-KyoAnifags come into threads and start shitposting. <br>You fucking faggots always act like KyoAnifags are intruding your personal space when it's the other way around. <br><br>I love this two faced garbage of acting like KyoAnifags only care about on side of the coin even though you people only ever focus on the other. Bravo, incredibly different.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Their shows are all styles with little substances. At the end of the day, people want to see creativity in the plot and character department. Kyoani can't expand the buyer base just by catering to the same group following their style of highschool moe sol.</br>    <br><br>That's because people only know them as teh trainwreck studio since they cherry pick their worst shows to shitpost and ignore all their good ones as well as they're strong OVA and movie work which Japan is well aware of. Westerners these days are mainly interested in the flashy new studios like Silver Link, Trigger, A-1 and White Fox or ones that have had recent quirky hits in the last decade like Kyoani and Shaft none of which are really popular in Japan outside of their biggest hits. K-On for Kyoani, Madoka for Shaft, Kill LA Kill for Trigger, Steins;Gate for White Fox, Ano Hana for A-1 and Non Non Biyori for Silver Link. Of those only two are even originals, while Sunrise has quietly on this side of the Atlantic had at least 5 10K selling since the year has started across Movies, OVAS and TV none of which are necessarily the same genre. It's amazing how no matter what they manage to remain invisible outside of Japan.</br></br>  <br>I respect them as a business, but as storytellers fuck them.</br>  <br>A1 won't fall because they are part of Aniplex. Most popular materials will get picked up by Aniplex and given to A1 so they will always do ok in sales. <br><br>A1 and Sunrise also has a kind of cooperative relationship in which many A1's key animation scenes are taken cared if by Sunrise. If you notice, the animation styles and designs from recent A1 shows resemble Sunrise's as well.</br></br></br>  <br>You realize that they focus on character interactions and not story?</br>  Gainax in its 90s prime was good<br>Shaft? absolutely not, nothing good in terms of visual apealing aesthethics thats not BLOOM OR DARK SHADE RANDOMLY!<br><br><br>Or random highlights, its like a fucking autistic adhd roller coaster to watch some of their shows.<br><br><br>Toei animation was good in the 80s and 90s, then it turned out that latest dbz movie.<br><br>Holy fucking shit, how can it have come to this? that one of the best fighting chereography companies on the planet suddenly turned out one of the worst fighting chereography? <br><br>Of course new people will come and go to a company, BUT.....every company LEARNS WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOES NOT WORK!<br><br><br>Compare any shonen or seinen manga to any western comic, be it american capes or european comics thats too cartoony.<br><br><br>There is not a single good fighting chereography comic out there. The japanese are not stupid, they KNOW what works, only by the power of the editors who dont know shit about anime or manga and its just nepotism how they got there in the first place, can ruin something like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now post Ufotable's.</br>  <br>This is the reason why focusing on a studio like a brand name is stupid.<br><br>Since A-1 is part of Aniplex, they very often adapt the most popular LNs, which vary a lot in genre and style. Most studios have little choice in what they adapt or if they have the ability to make an original.<br><br>If someone says 'my favourite studio is A1' it sounds fucking retarded because A1 have made such a wide variety of shows that are all very different. <br><br><br> ... <br>Please kill yourself you retarded ass tripfag that can't type properly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's sad that Horizon got so little recognition outside of Japan even though it was a better show with better action sequences than the first F/Z airing in the same season. Sunrise's best animation are truly the best when they seriously try.</br>  <br>That is ufo, retard</br>   people seriously thinking that Ghibli films aren't beautifully animated and well designed, even if their scripts are sometimes really bland   <br>It's an objective fact so one can just ignore the autists.</br>  Reading this thread, there are too many damn anime studios.  <br>I can't imagine that pic righteously getting much use.</br>  <br>Gainax go back to making another kill la kill season just to put another foot in the grave.</br>  <br>Holy shit you are retarded</br>  <br> Gainax <br> KlK <br>Are you on special education, or just high?</br></br></br>  Kyoani post Hyouka  <br>fuck off dumbass</br>  <br>http://www38.atwiki.jp/uri-archive/<wbr>m/pages/13.html?guid=on</wbr></br>  <br>4/10 I smirked.</br>    <br>He's a retarded /co/tard that's really fucking new. and knows fuck all about anime.</br>  <br> &gt;implying UBW wasn't one of the best things of it's respective seasons <br>Holy hell get your head examined.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit you're dumb.</br>  I tend to hate the fanbases more than the studios, which I feel neutral about most of the time.<br><br> ufotable <br>Retards actually claiming they have the best 'fighting animation' and the best CGI ever. They tend to shit on every other TM-related adaption if it's not done by ufotable and ignore anything bad such as terrible CGI and QUALITY frames - ufotable can do no wrong.<br><br> Trigger <br>le saving anime maymay<br><br> Kyoani <br>Attracts a lot of pretentious contrarians who tend to hail them as making the best anime of all time. Hyoukafags took it to a whole new level, comparing it to classic literature in terms of writing and Ghibli in terms of symbolism and animation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you on special medication or dont understand the joke dumbass?<br><br>Gainax didnt do it, but those who worked on another gainax project was so simular. Its so terrible that they just copied the animation of it downright to the core.</br></br></br>  <br>Another thing is that A1 doesn't have teams always there for them. They tend to grab a freelancer director and give him the project. Meanwhile KyoAni, Shaft and MAPPA(Ushio no Tora is an exception) have their own inhouse talent for the main stuff.</br>  <br>What? Not him but A-1 being shit is common knowledge, just look at their best sellers SAO, im@s CG and Utapri Evol.</br>  ITT: IRC and /v/ spam KyoAni, the best anime studio.  <br> anyone who likes what I dislike must get their heads examined <br>Holy shit, what a retarded shitpost<br>You're the one who needs to get his head examined, since you seem to be able to understand it's normal for people to like what you dislike, and to dislike what you like</br></br></br>  <br>How can an studio that mostly makes boring SOLcrap be the best?<br>And Í'm not from IRC or /v/, stop with your boogeymans</br></br>  <br>This is false flagging to the max.<br>Even if you think KyoAni is the best studio, you're a retard if you don't think there are people who don't dislike their shows on /a/.<br><br><br>Yup. They outsource fuckloads, way more than other studios do. At least Shaft pretty much has very similiar leading Shaft and KyoAni keep their 'style' similar throughout their recent shows. They're really the exceptions because of this since a lot of other studios don't do this. KyoAni especially since they distribute and adapt what they want pretty much. Shaft is still a bitch to big publishers like most studios.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's bait.</br>  <br> Anyone who thinks UBW isn't the AotS is objectively wrong <br>You're a retarded shitpost. Go back to /v/.</br></br>  KyoAni.<br><br> make SoL high school <br> make cash or at least manabi line <br> fail when they try anything else (like comedy) <br> regarded as one of the best studios because of animation and milking the SoL </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you want to talk about which studio is best or which is worst, that's an alright discussion.<br>if you want to talk about other people's perceptions of which is the best or the worst, that's a worthless discussion and you are probably a child or a woman for even caring.</br></br>  <br>This. It's as retarded as talking about 'the worst fanbases'.<br><br>It's worthless and cancer.</br></br></br>  <br> Not liking boring crap is bait <br>Whatever you say. kid<br><br>Do you have problems with reading comprehension or something? I never said that people who think UBW isn't AOTS are objectively wrong (I don't even believe in objective anime quality) <br>I never even said UBW was AOTS.<br>I said it was one of the best things of it's seasons, but not the best<br>I also said that the dude should get his head checked because his post implied that people with different opinion to his have something wrong in their heads, when it's normal for people to have different opinions</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ebina's episode (episode 02) in almost 4 hours, get in.    <br>Ebin!</br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6-r<wbr>vBsFzXm0</wbr>  [ ]  my favorit girl !!!

The only ones this group really needs are Kurumi(Combat/Scouting/Vehicular Control/Resource Acquisition) and Yuki (Morale/Navigation/Planning). Yuuri used to do Resource Management, but it's not really needed now. At least Miki's trying to learn how to drive.  </br></br></br>  <br>It's up to date now, and it seems to be new chapters monthly.

It should start to sell now or it might not even go over the manabi line. Madoka too started to dominate rankings after ep 3 when Miami got charlotted.<br><br>I know but anime is not bad at all.

As she's nearly done a few times already.</br>  I hope the university girls aren't up to something bad, the poor girls have had enough already.  <br>You sure about that? Try remembering the first chapter. If something is nice at the start, it's going to be a fucking hellhole the next second.</br>  <br>They're  cannibals. <br><br>Alternatively, they're working with the guys in bike helmets with baseball bats, maybe to rob other survivors or something.</br></br></br>  <br>They are clearly plotting for something.</br>  <br>At the best, they'll be indifferent and told them to leave. <br> <br>This is totally plausible.</br></br></br>  Is the manga weekly or monthly?  <br>Because the beta males dies pathetically and the whiteknights is whiteknighting so hard that they died lefting the girls.<br>The alpha male? Don't worry they survive and probably already been rescued.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>That is, if her "Plot Shield" isn't expiring until the end or at least until she found the antidote (which is less likely).<br> Besides, A lot of people is worshipping Kurumi right now, I doubt the author would kill her in a way as mainstream as those (except if he/she wanted a riot) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monthly, releases on the 24th according to Wikipedia</br>  <br>She won't kill herself though<br>She's not a coward</br></br>  <br>Thanks. <br>I can't wait for the next chapter.</br></br>  <br>Lesbian rape dungeon.</br>  <br>Same, it's really grabbed me</br>  <br><br>What if she does it so that her friends wouldn't have to?</br></br>  <br>Dude's probably going to kill her in the most suffering way possible, then ease the pain with the greatest healing ever known.</br>  Do they even masturbate?  <br>There can't be an healing if best girl die. If she die, it will be a downfall into abyss.<br>But I doubt the author will kill her.</br></br>  <br>They're eighteen, they most definitely do.<br>Now, the frequency is debatable, but I believe Miko shlicks the most out of the four main ones.</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br> With the shovel, though. </br></br>  <br> best girl <br>I agree; there's no way Yuki can die. Kurumi's fucked though. <br><br><br>She's been alone for months out of pure spite, so yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably, they're 17-18, combine that with constant stress due to the situation they're in, they need to evacuate the stress, probably by masturbation.</br>  <br>Remember, anything can happen depending on what the author is thinking. There's even a chance where they'll be raped until the bikers saves them or something.</br>  <br>Why only Yuki and her delusions wear blue uniform?</br>  <br><br>And everytime something shitty happens, it turns out to be just fine the next second.<br><br>Just have faith.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A better question would be...Do they masturbate together?</br></br>  <br>"Flick The Bean" Ring.</br>  Why did Shinji fap over Asuka?  <br><br>Again, you're missing my point. They are not separate endings. With EoE, you still get 26, and Shinji leaning to love himself. But without EoE, you only get 26, and it's incomplete.</br></br>  <br> both endings happen and they are one, then neither is incomplete as they make one whole. <br><br>Exactly, with both 26 and EoE you get a complete ending. With just 26 you get an unresolved story and a message that's diminished by the fact that reality no longer applies to Shinji so his epiphany is meaningless in his circumstances, and less relatable as a result.</br></br></br>  What's Anno going to do next?  <br>The message isn't diminished, it's complete in NGE.<br><br>You can add more to it, but it doesn't make it incomplete.</br></br></br>  <br> They are not separate endings <br>According to Anno and co. they are. According to Japan they are. Your interpretation is not fact.<br> you still get 26, and Shinji leaning to love himself <br>Nowhere in EoE does it even hint that. Furthermore, Shinji is used as a placement for Otaku and direct statements against Otaku are included, which is something nonexistent in Eva TV. EoE was made in reaction to the fans, NGE wasn't. This makes them separate no matter what you choose to interpret. I personally believe NGE's ending is superior and more conclusive and consistent in the story they were trying to tell. Plot is ultimately unneeded as long as Shinji's arc is concluded, which is something we don't really get in EoE.</br></br></br></br>  reminder  <br> Walk to home gently </br>  What did they use to bloat up the image like that  <br>waifu2x and photoshop</br>  <br>Kagami best girl, fite me fags</br>        Me as well!        every time    <br> that upscale </br>    <br> that feel when all the threads you start can't even get ten replies <br>Sure feels bad to have elite taste.</br></br>  <br>thank you I try</br>    <br>Nigga what</br>      select all images with flowers    Th-thanks    Kagami Hiragi is all alone at College END    tsukasa        tsukasa is sick!        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Can someone explain this shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably.</br>    What's most amazing is that every time I make this thread, the Spookasa dump I receive is always unique.  everytime    <br>2<br>deep<br>4<br>u</br></br></br></br>  <br>any time</br>  spookasa, newfriend  <br> *sip* </br>  <br>What's there to explain?</br>  Apparently I've got 113 of these.    <br>Where did the idea come from?</br>  <br>underneath</br>    <br>The same place all ideas come from.</br>  This is the first lucky star thread I've been in in years<br>What happened to you guys?<br><br>And how many more pictures is that story?

Enjoy your corner. I'd join you if I could.</br>   lucky star manga is over a decade old <br> lucky star anime is almost a decade old <br>Why does it feel so... <br>weird?</br></br></br>  <br>No turning back anon, look forward.</br>  Is lolicore still a thing?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GRT<wbr>kfczaMXk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>But the future is scary<br>I wanna go back to the time i was more ignorant of things and had fun watching lucky star and haruhi was still huge<br>I just want those times back</br></br></br>  <br><br>I have a few questions. Was all the shit about Konata being obsessed with KyoAni anime shoe-horned in? What's the manga like after they graduate?<br><br><br>I posted a thread a few days ago, but people thought I was just trolling, mainly because I had never seen a Lucky Star thread (I browse /a/ on and off, but it is the board I have visited the most since about last October) and because I said that I tried watching it when it aired and didn't like it. <br><br>Point is, there was no creepy Tsukasa shit. Though I'm glad I came across this, I'm gonna go lurk for creepy pics of other shows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Was all the shit about Konata being obsessed with KyoAni anime shoe-horned in? <br>Well, Lucky Star is a KyoAni anime, so yes.<br>I love that they did that, though.<br><br>Also, I honestly enjoy the fan work of Lucky Star way more than the show. Lucky Star is kind of shit; it could've been salvageable with more yuri, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone here know which artis is behind the inspiration? Like on this one  Giorgio de Chirico is.  Posting undeniably best moment from the show<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q_R<wbr>PZcSZWJo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Oh nvm, I found out in the end.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0OU<wbr>TSQGSbow</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ja nii </br></br>    I am glad your threads are shit. Thus unto the true moefags.  <br>Masterpiece</br>  <br>FLASHING BACK TO 2009 AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT</br>  <br> kind of shit <br>Why do you think that? I thought it was one of the best SoLs I have ever watched. I want to say that it is objectively better than K-On, though I like K-On a bit more because of how emotional it gets. Lucky Star doesn't need emotional baggage to be good, and I think that's why it is objectively better.<br><br><br><br>Just a thought: it probably has something to do with how Tsukasa was drawn after reacting to OP's pic? She also mentions she has to email Konata, which is probably why Konata is also in a lot of the pics.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do you think that? <br>It just kind of bored me, and there were probably some references I didn't get (definitely had to google the timotei scene).<br><br>It's probably partly because I never watched it when it aired. It's probably better suited to a once-a-week watching.<br><br>I did like the segment at the end of each episode, and the dancing outside in the OP was great.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6zJ<wbr>Xi-FU7sA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bait <br>If you're truly OP, don't call it that. It's just yuri.</br></br>    <br> Oh, Konata got some of hair stuck while on train... <br><br>HOLY FUCK SHES NOT ON THE TRAIN</br></br></br>  <br> stuck <br>That looks like Tsukasa did it on purpose...</br></br>  2 hours of sleep lads<br><br>Did some hunting, I now have 593 of these images, admittedly some of them Touhou.</br></br>    Many of these are actually really cute so I must hunt for the absurd ones.  <br>B-but Tsukasa would never do such a thing... right?</br>  <br>she is innocent</br>  <br>You know what? I have no idea anymore. I've lost track of which Tsukasa is real and which one is just a madman's nightmare.</br>  <br>Who's to say there even is a Tsukasa?</br>  <br>Enjoy your stay<br><br><br> 593 <br>goddamn, son. You better fucking put up or shut up. And where'd ya find them? I wanna start a collection</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe I am Tsukasa. Maybe I was jealous of my sister's romance. Maybe I did something I shouldn't have. Maybe I didn't do anything. I want somebody to tell me.</br>  <br>I have a splitting headache so how about filename.<br><br><br>You are not Tsukasa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then who am I? I have been here for so long I can't really remember.</br>  <br> Jealous of sister's romance <br> sister's romance <br><br>Get out of here, imposter! <br><br>I am the real Tsukasa</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not Tsukasa.<br><br><br>This guy is Tsukasa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hi Tsukasa.<br><br>Okay, I'm glad we found her.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> check in on Lucky Star thread at 2 am <br> see this <br>I don't know what I expected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Prove you are truly Tsukasa;<br><br>What is your favorite source?</br></br></br>  <br>"No" would have hurt less</br>  <br>tsuuukasa</br>  <br>It's okay, I wasn't really sure I was her anyway.

When is your father's birthday? When is your mother's birthday? When did your parents marry? Did they marry for love? Or was it an arranged marriage? Why don't you know? Have they never told you?

But thanks for the thought.</br>  <br>H I P S<br>I<br>P<br>S</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like art that gives Konata a bit of a figure as well. She's petite and flat, but still a woman.</br>  <br>These people did something very odd with Tsukasa.</br>    <br>Somebody suggested something cute, that Konakona would be totally oblivious and shy when it comes to lovey dovey stuff, while Kagamin would be assertive, kind of reversing the characters' personalities.</br>  <br>Somebody suggested something cute, that Tsukasa would be a bullying, sociopathical monster instead of sweet and kind...</br>  <br>That might of been me, there are a few doujin that have the concept of Kagami being a beast in bed while Konata is actually kinda shy (but not oblivious) about having sex. I really love those</br>  <br>I purchase pork filled tube products</br>  <br>Tsukasa is no1 ditz/loving/friendly waifu. The forgotten boring main character is the one no one talks about...

Just feels like the place is losing what made it and replacing it with weaker new blood.</br></br></br></br>    I need to share this, since I've only found one other person with a similar experience on an archived thread from several years ago. <br><br>I was downloading some music off of the deep web about a year ago. Along with the music files was a file titled 'konata dance.exe'. Without thinking, I ran it. It seemed harmless at first; all it did was leave a dancing Konata on my desktop. I thought it was cute, so I left it alone. I shut off my computer.<br><br>Next time I booted, I found 2000 copies of a picture of Konata saved on my desktop. It still didn't bother me, since I rarely turn off my computer. This went on for another month or two. Each time I restarted, booting was just a little slower. Eventually, it took several minutes for it to get going, so I tried everything to get rid of it. I deleted every relevant file I could think of, to no effect. No anti-virus could find anything wrong. I tried using a restore point, but I didn't have any from before I ran the executable. Worst of all, there was no help online.<br><br>In the end, I had to completely remove Windows; I'm Linux master race now. Don't let it happen to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Konata is crying on your chest because her favorite anime is taking a turn for the worse. Wat do?

I've always found them amusing, and there were a metric fuck-ton of them back around the genesis of the site due to Something Awful crossover and attitudes being different back then. Tripfags have always been a part of 4chan.<br><br>The site hasn't been fun in a long while, honestly.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H0i<wbr>mue5uHiw</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I honestly feel like it's mostly just a meme.

Let's keep it that way.<br><br>For those who haven't caught up on the LNs you can read Vol.11 chapter 1 here:<br> https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br> The ride never ends. </br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>Did Watari confirm in the Author's Comments at the end that Volume 12 would end the series?</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  Why does Yuki add "kashira" when she's asking questions? What does that mean?  <br>No, nothing like that is confirmed yet.</br>  <br>Nope. He just said Volume 12 are the climax of this series.</br>  Reminder that if double YY weren't both 9/10 and 10/10 in looks, 8man would've already dropped their asses after the 2nd or 3rd volume. 8man is just a huge fool.  <br>Verbal tic maybe.</br>  can we let this thread die until we get chapter 2 translated?  <br>The climax of the series starts with Yukino's request? I like the sound of that.</br>  <br>If Yukino were 7/10 with the same attitude he would've probably been more aggressive in trying to intimidate her when they met only for it to backfire just the same.</br>  Left or right /a/?  <br>Iroha.<br>Always Iroha.</br></br>  <br>We've done this already, even in polls.<br><br>The answer will always be Iroha.</br></br></br>  <br>Dumb cowtits who doesn't know what's going on or sly kouhai already taking off her top.<br>Gee I wonder which one I should pick.</br></br>  <br>You already know the answer.</br>    <br>Every time</br>  Will she ever ask him again?    this anime was terrible  <br><br>No need to worry about that, /yahari/ won't be sticking around for much longer. <br><br>https://archive.moe/tv/thread/58657<wbr>835/#58657873</wbr></br></br></br></br>    Saki is love, Saki is life.  <br> No third option. <br>Pic Related.</br></br>  <br>There is no need for a third option. Though, Komachi would be fine.</br>  <br>Are you into NTR and being cucked?<br>if you do then left.<br><br>Do you want a warm and loving devoted waifu?<br>then right is the only choice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally the first to reply and try to bait.<br>Fuck off back to your camp already.</br></br>  <br/>  Is he genuine?  <br>I like this one better</br>  <br>No, but he's her genuine.</br>  How was their childhood, /a/?  <br>Genuine good taste</br>  PLEASE.<br>JUST END HER SUFFERING;<br>MINE TOO.</br></br>  <br>From the thumbnail I thought they were Satsuki and Ryuko.</br>  Haruno is the best Onee-chan~<br>Always doing her best to look out for her little autistic imouto.<br><br>Haruno:<br><br>  1. “Teehee, you’re playing coy. Big sis won’t forgive you if you make Yukino‐chan cry.” <br><br>  2. “Oh, that reminds me. Hikigaya‐kun. Wanna go out for tea with me if you’re free? I have to make sure you’re good enough to be Yukino‐chan’s boyfriend.” Haruno‐ san threw out her chest and winked lightly in my direction. <br><br>  3. “Yeah, you’re right. It has nothing to do with me,” she said, pulling back abruptly as if jumping away. “As long as you’ve put thought into it, it’s fine, Yukino‐chan. I was trying to help, but I was butting in. Sorry about that.” <br><br>  4. It might’ve been due to looking at Yukinoshita Haruno with a perceptive view that I felt that Haruno-san might in reality be fond of Yukinoshita. <br><br>  5. “That’s what everyone says at first. But they all end up doing the same thing. They get jealous of Yukino- chan, hate her, reject her, and then start ostracizing her... I hope that you’ll be different from them.” <br><br>  6. “That’s fine. If a scoundrel like you is actually being diligent, then that’ll rile them up in one way or another. They won’t grow if the enemy doesn’t keep it together, after all. <br><br> But with her humorous gesture, her opened eyes were looking over at Yukinoshita. <br><br> That gaze caused a baseless thought to flash into my head. <br><br> “Um, could it be…” <br><br> My moving lips were stopped in place by her soft fingers. <br><br> “I don’t like perceptive kids, okay?” <br><br> Suppose that the existence of an enemy is the simplest way to spur human growth. <br><br> Could it be that this person was acting so she could appear as the enemy? I found myself thinking that despite having no proof at all. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nobody sees her suffering.</br></br>  <br>Right is the right choice.<br>We've been over this.</br></br>   you will never kidnap Spyro and force him to translate 24/7 in your basement   Can anyone translate this?    <br>Even if it had Iroha in it I wouldn't be able to TL it because the pic size is too small to recognize the some of the kanji in there.<br>Post a pixiv link or better resolution and wait for that one Yuifag moonfag to do it.</br></br>  <br> small kanji <br>you need glasses man<br> but you're right, there's no Iroha </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> samefagging Irohafag <br><br>topkek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup, you got me.<br>And you don't need to be pissed at the polls because they don't go your way, you know.</br></br>  <br>Your wish is granted.</br>  <br>Albeit the fact that most of /a/ hates her and want nothing more than see her get a truck end, I hope that she gets a good ending. Hopefully 8man can prove her that genuine relationships do exist and make her desire one of her own.<br><br>I think the quote in the picture describes why 8man and Haruno are the way they are and why they feel so skeptical about relationships.</br></br></br>  <br>if you seriously believe that a poll, that was conducted in a thread that has usually 100~ ip's and around 75% that lurking , can't get 5 votes in a min you're an idiot.</br>  <br>nice photo shopping skill faggot.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>No, because next time, he will ask her.</br></br>    Is sensei irrelevant because she plays bass or does she play bass because she's irrelevant?  <br> 444 <br>Confirmed</br></br>  <br>I'm not even mad.<br>I'm half Yukino-kin.<br>Fug you and you trips</br></br></br>  <br>That was like the 6th or 7th poll where Iroha stayed on top.</br>  <br>No, I'm the real samefag.</br>  <br>Wrong sister.</br>  <br>Wow how pathetic,<br>are Irohafags really that desperate?</br></br>  <br>Look everyone it's the last surviving Yuifag.<br>Probably butthurt proxyfag couldn't fuck up those polls or future polls to hide how much Yui is irrelephant.</br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT ANON<br>YOU GOT ME</br></br>  <br> Irrelephant </br>  <br> Irohafags talk about relevance <br><br>Gets me everytime.</br></br></br>   “…Then, that means I’ll just have to ask again.” <br> It was a will brazen and intense that could veil even hostility. Her beautiful eyes were as though they were stars that glowed translucently. <br> It felt like those eyes were telling me: “I won’t make any excuses. So, look at me.” <br><br><br> Crap, I really just couldn’t win against her. If she’s going to tell me something like that with that cute of a face, how could I even say anything back? <br> Suddenly, the words of the fox came to mind. <br> ––Words are the source of misunderstandings, after all. <br> How completely true. <br> You can’t clear misunderstandings. There will always be things you can’t undo in life and your mistaken answers will stay as they are. <br> That’s why instead, you should give up on them and pose the question again. <br> All for the sake of knowing a new and correct answer. <br> Both Yukinoshita and I didn’t know each other. <br> What is it we should have to call it “knowing”? We didn’t understand that. <br> Had we just watched each other, then we could have understood too. What is essential is invisible to the eye. That’s because we would avert our eyes. <br> I would. <br> We would. <br><br>What exactly were those questions they wanted to ask again?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a comic where 8man speaks his thoughts out loud <br>Oh man. I sure there's more.</br></br>  <br>I dunno if a Kaorifag should be talking about irrelevance.</br>  <br>Yui is 0% elephant. I don't know how anyone could like her or still think she's relephant to the plot.<br><br>BTW She's the only one out of the three "main" girls I like.  Cake&amp;Hitlerfag </br></br></br>  <br>Kaori doesn't need a big fanbase because she is a functional human being that isn;t obsessed with an edgelord's cock</br>  The only real races here are:<br>Yuifags, Yukinofags, Sakifags, Saikafags and Komachifags.<br>Even Haruno and Orimoto are more legit. Even the blondie cocksucker is more legit.<br>Iroha WASN'T EVEN NECESSARY in the novels. It's cheeky good and all, but that's it. There's nothing more to her.<br>So could you please stop talking down to everyone of us like you had a fucking gold medal?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply, m8. Now sit there and keep waiting for those translations.</br>  <br>As a Kaorifag I agree.<br>She may be far from perfect, but as one anon said once:<br> perfect since day one <br>(by the way, I'm a Yuifag by day)</br></br></br></br>  <br>So is Yui.</br>  Nice thread guys! <br><br>Keep it up! <br><br>So i finally free from this 24/7 BTB thread.</br></br></br></br>  Why doesn't anyone ever sexualize 8man?  <br>A glutton for punishment, I love it..</br>  <br>He's already a fuck boy.</br>  Do it, Watari. Just fucking do it.  <br> implying she doesn't schlick every night thinking about all the ways 8man can insult her as she cries herself to sleep. <br><br><br>Yui and Yukino were also unnecessary. 8man solved all the cases by himself. He just held himself back to give them a chance to get some points, but they could never follow through.<br>I want 8man to go back to solving scooby doo tier mysteries by making an ass out of himself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry. I already grew roots waiting for the second batch of novels and the second season.<br><br>Mai negro</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Iroha kissing 8man? I thought she was in love with Hayama? OOC fanart is not fun.</br>  <br>8man is kissing her because she kissed Hayama and 8man is in love with Hayama, since homosexuality is not welcome in Hayama's family 8man has to live with a secondhand kiss</br>  <br> I want 8man to go back to solving scooby doo tier mysteries by making an ass out of himself. <br>Me too<br> Yui and Yukino were also unnecessary. 8man solved all the cases by himself. <br>What I meant is that Iroha has not (YET) been as much relevant into the problem solving stuff. She has not given us readers her opinion about 8man's crudeness, and what she would do.<br>At least we got her to talk about the geniune, that's a start.<br><br>I do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, so Iroha has only seen 8man when he's been at his best? or rather not a self-destructive cynical guy.</br>  Posting for translations.  <br> S1 8man <br>Twerp<br><br> S2 8man <br>Handsome as fuck<br><br>Did they change this because they wanted to make it more believable that two good looking girls would fall for him?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Dude, that's english.</br>  <br>He doesn't have the balls<br> ;_; <br> Please do it, Watari </br></br></br>  <br>Iroha</br>  <br>Well, I guess you keep telling yourself that to make yourself feel better about liking the arguably most ugliest MC in history man.</br>  <br>Yui</br>  <br>You mean at his worst. Depressed because he doesn't know why YY2 got mad during Kyoto and she overheard muh genuine.<br><br><br>Iroha is for healing. If it wasn't for her request everyone would still be sitting around like assholes in the clubroom. She gave 8man a purpose and hope.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Iroha</br>  <br>Yukino</br>  <br>He got too soft since he started caring for the girls. If he went full edge that would probaby get her even more wet though.<br><br><br>I loved him since S1. Now he just grew up a bit and became more of a men. This isn't even his final form.<br>...That reminds me... How good do you thing Final Form Yukino will be?<br>Final Form Yui will probably be like his mother. Which is unarguably 10/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui</br>  <br>Haruno</br>  <br>GET THAT MEME OUT OF MY THREAD AND NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.<br>I give you the other thing, If it wasn't for her, 8man would not have gone from 8/10 edgy husbando to what he has become.<br>MFW PERFECT FORM 8MAN IS BEST HUSBANDO.</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha</br>  <br>Iroha</br>  <br>Yui</br>  <br>Iroha</br>  <br>Yui</br>  <br> How good do you thing Final Form Yukino will be? <br>Probably just overconfident dere since the Ice Queen isn't needed anymore.</br></br>  <br>Yui</br>  I wonder if Hachiman would like her?<br>He would probably dump her ass when he discovers how arrogant she can be sometimes.<br>I'm not completely sure though... I mean, she always has little kindness inside herself that comes out when no one is looking.</br></br>  <br>All</br>  <br>Tomoko? She's way too selfish for 8man</br>  <br>Nah she's pretty much an awful person through and through.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Please Translate these.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think she'd see the resemblance?</br>  <br><br>You should read the manga.<br>She has her moments that remind you just how human she can be.<br>She's a total fuckup anyways, far from an angel, I'm not even gonna try to defend her but she's not all corrupted. There's always hope.<br><br> overconfident dere <br>Anon I think I may be retarded, because I don't get what you mean.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have read the manga. She is human, all right, but a shitty person. Hachiman would see right through her.</br>  <br>She's a pretty selfish person i the manga too. Not as bad as in the anime but still way too much for 8man's "sacrifice yourself for everything" mindset<br><br>Also he seems to hate people who refuse to fix their problems themselves, which pretty much sums up Watamote</br></br></br>  <br>Everything looked fine until you see Iroha and Saki.<br>Something about them feels off.</br></br>  <br> overconfident dere <br> Anon I think I may be retarded, because I don't get what you mean. <br>I forgot to delete the dere part.<br>I was going to say overconfident about her actions or something like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The volunteer club will continue with Hikki being my lover and Yukinon being my friend<br><br>So that means Yukinon will have to give up on Hikki!<br><br>Text outside of box: Certainly evil<br><br><br>So you're telling me you want me to stop agonizing Yukino-chan and co.?<br><br>But the suffering isn't going to top there<br><br>Text outside of box: Certainly evil</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where the hell am I supposed to find the LNs?

I think she could get very well along with 8man because he's a softcore edgy kid... They would be both awkward towards themselves.

I think that "genuine" means a lot to her too, which is why she's straining their relationship so much, to test the strength of their bonds. I really hope that by the end of the series, Hachiman (and Yukino) somehow opens Haruno's eyes and then maybe Haruno decides not to go through with her arranged marriage.</br>  <br> trips <br><br><br>What are you implying anon?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No she only likes him platonically.<br><br>Yui is pretty jealous of other girls getting close to him, take Megruin's friendliness for example.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Hayama raped Yukino</br>  <br>Nah... she's just and edgy kid.<br>We all were edgy kids at least once.<br><br>*vietnam flashbacks*</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui is pretty jealous of other girls getting close to him, take Megruin's friendliness for example. <br>I wonder what Yui would do if she found out that Saki and Iroha like him too.

Why do lolis have to grow up ;_;<br><br> Hey b-b-baka baka, how do you make your stars so nice <br> I still don't understand <br> Let me get closer (straddles in his lap) <br> I sit like this with my mom all the time, so don't get any weird ideas. <br> C'mon lets make one together(hands brush up against eachother) <br> (looks up into his face and starts blushing) <br> D-don't look at me like that baka baka, you're making feel weird <br> Here, I'm going to cover your eyes. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you believe that this was Yukino's personality as a kid?</br>  <br>Yukino's personality as a kid didn't exist, she was a doll she didn't talk or socialize and only followed and did whatever Yukino did.<br>She started coming out of her shell with Hayama but she only ended up getting hurt when they entered school so the Ice Queen was born.</br></br>  <br>Yep, if she wasn't a huge twatsicle she wouldn't have been bullied as much.<br><br>Also pretending to be in trouble so Hayama would come to her rescue. Hiding her own goddamn shoes 60+ times so the teachers would show her more sympathy and praise her.<br><br> Seriously fuck Kodomo no Jikan, that show made me so angry </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> followed and did whatever Yukino did. <br>Whatever Haruno did I mean.</br></br>  <br>I don't know man. When he acted like a thirsty dweeb he didn't get anything.<br><br>Also did you see the love triangle coming?<br><br><br>8man also likes Saika.<br><br>I wonder if Yui woud let him do anal if she found out 8man liked boipussy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yui already knows that.<br><br>Also, vol6.25 when?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ah I see, so basically what you guys are telling me is that you're misinterpreting Yukino as a character and putting the blame on her. Thanks.</br></br>  <br>Both those posts are two completely different things.<br><br>The first one literally just saying everything Yukino said about herself.<br><br>The second one is going along with the manipulative little girl thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do lolis have such great asses <br><br>They don't, you autistic pedophile</br></br></br>  <br>My big problem with the first response is that it makes it seem that Yukino started off as someone with low self-esteem/dependency issues by default, instead of her becoming that way because she couldn't take the pressure of having to maintain te perfect image of being a Yukinoshita offspring (among other pressures).</br>  <br> Yui already knows that. <br>So how does she feel about Hikki liking boys?</br></br>  <br>Everyone knows about Hikki's obsession with Saika and everyone finds it weird even himself claiming he might love Saika a bit too much.</br>  <br> “What exactly did you take pictures of to use up so much memory…?” <br><br> Yukinoshita stated in astoundment while Yuigahama thought it over and made a big nod. <br><br> “The Tennis Club… So Sai-chan, huh…? I guess there’s not much we can do there.” <br><br> “Yui-senpai, you’re really okay with that!?” <br><br> So she finally gave up… No, there’s a small chance she acknowledged it… <br><br>Judge this by yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Hachiman wanted to cut off his arm or leg, would Yui allow him? Seems like she's really willing to let him do whatever the fuck he wants. I don't know if that's healthy.</br>  <br>Yui has pretty much given up and accepted that she can't control Hikki.</br>  <br>She would tell him that she dislike it like what she did at end vol 7 and vol 10,5 chapter 3.</br>  <br> unconditionally loves Hikki <br> supports him without question <br> accepts him no matter what comes up <br>How is she not genuine?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Give up! Nothing but katakana lines.<br><br>Cannot be implemented without a meaning!!<br><br> Outside the box:  <br>Indeed a fair argument.<br><br><br> Already translated and typesetted. <br><br><br>I'm simply not useless.<br><br>I play an active role after all.<br><br><br> Just use commie's TL for this one <br>Pleease...I was clearly being myself there.<br><br><br> Iroha part, screw the rest. <br>Senpai.

Thanks. <br><br> Drink it carefully &lt;3 <br> Absolutely! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, not really.<br><br> I chose the wrong words when I called the person who was worried for me unfair. I rotated my chair and turned my body towards Yuigahama. I sat there while digging around for the proper words to tell her. Yuigahama, however, didn’t give me the time and nodded. <br><br> “…Yeah, I think I am unfair!” Yuigahama said, her voice cheerful and as though she was convinced of something. <br><br> I didn’t quite catch the meaning behind her response, but I wanted to get the right nuance across to her and opened my mouth. <br><br> “I didn’t mean it like that, but uh, in a good way…” <br><br> Yuigahama, however, shook her head and interjected. “I think… I really am unfair… It’s because I can never stop you or even help you. And also… for a bunch of other things.” <br><br> Yuigahama’s words were in a jumble, perhaps because she was trying to think while she talked. But it’s due to that that I felt her words were from the bottom of her heart. In the same way she’d laugh to hide her embarrassment or mumble her words and look away, I’m sure she wanted to play it off somehow. <br><br> But even so, she looked straight at me, as though wanting to tell me everything. <br><br> “That’s why… That’s why, when something like this happens again, I’ll make sure to do it.” <br><br> Her sincere expression and her slowly weaved words were imbued with a sense of reality but also an empty ambiguity. Eventually, everyone would make sure to do it. They had to, even if they didn’t know what it is that they needed to do or if they could do it. I’m sure that’s something that everyone thinks about, even if vaguely. <br><br>She has her own resolve regarding him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the part where she ran for the stuco president to stop 8man from committing social kamikaze?</br>  <br>She did it to save the club she loved.</br>  <br>And in the end, the ones who saved the club were 8man and Iroha.</br>  <br>And essentially prevent 8man's social suicide. (hence the suki nano)<br>Yui was the first one that noticed what 8man was trying to do.<br><br>Yukino also did this because she wanted to prove 8man's method is wrong, <br>but in her case she actually wanted to become the president in order to surpass Haruno.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino also did this because she wanted to prove 8man's method is wrong, <br>She didn't want him to social sudoku too.</br></br>  <br>By proofing him wrong.<br><br>That is what I meant.</br></br></br>    What was the context when Kyousuke scream to Ayase "Ayase!

Isn't the reason why he got ostracized in the first place was because he didn't have good looks?</br>  <br>What is so good about Hikki anyway?<br>He is such a huge beta faggot.<br><br>If 8man were 2/10 with the same attitude both YY wouldn't give a shit about him in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not bad looking at all, except his eyes. His attitude is kimoi creepy warui and stuff though.</br>  <br>Good looks just means he takes care of himself. If he had a giant scar across the side of his face it might be shocking at first but over time they wouldn't care since it doesn't diminish his value as a person.</br>  <br>He developed that attitude because he got ostracized, not the other way around. So meaning there is something that got him isolated in the first place, and that is his looks.</br>  <br>This is from the same artist who draw "Body Swap" right? <br><br>Oh boy here we go again!</br></br></br>  yuibro from last night, reposting this for yukinofags who missed this ytd.<br><br>Behind the large aquarium walls an assortment of fishes were swimming, with some of the smaller fishes hiding in the algae.<br><br>Amongst them a large red fish with an elegant look to it was swimming about freely without fear.<br><br>Upon sighting the fish Yukinoshita observed "And there's this carefree fellow."<br><br>"This fish? It is quite big."<br><br>"Nowhere to go, unable to find a resting place.. hidden in the currents, being swept along and chasing after something, only to hit an invisible wall."<br><br>Yukinoshita reached her hand towards the glass wall but retracted it right before they touched. <br>As I glanced carefully to the side, Yukinoshita was staring blankly in front of her.<br><br>"Which fish are you talking about?"<br><br>Yukinoshita did not speak immediately but calmly exhaled before replying. "I was talking about myself."<br><br>After her answer, Yukinoshita wored an indiscernible lonely smile and touched the aquarium wall. <br><br>Yukinoshita's outstretched profile was seemingly being absorbed into the waters but obstructed by the glass walls from returning to her original place.<br><br>It was an ethereal sight, so transient as to disappear in the blink of an eye.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yay more! <br><br>Haruno magic that forces Hikki to speak his thoughts for one day?</br></br></br>  <br> crawling in my skin scene <br><br>Fucking hell, Yukino, not again.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does he always say that Yukino's figures are always transient? What are the implications of this?</br>  <br>No, he was a pretty weird kid to begin with, his track record with girls is just what turned him into the supreme edgelord we had at the beginning of the series.</br>  <br>her personality, or her eventual fate in the concluding epilogue.</br>  <br> Yukino at it again. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zsC<wbr>D5XCu6CM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>So she's going to go away? I mean she isn't in class J for a reason which is the international class. That's kind of sad.</br>  It seems you aren't ready for the true ending yet. You ought to prepare yourself, [a/.  Do some people ITT seriously not know that Georgia MAX Coffee/Emerald Mountain/Emerald Mountain Black are actually products of the Coca Cola Company?<br><br>Man... those guys must be real faggots.</br></br>  <br>You're forgetting the いろはす, that also belongs to coca cola.</br>  Can someone translate that ending?  <br> yukino <br>Nah.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not only ready, I'm looking forward to it.</br></br>  <br>Come on Yukino,<br>Can't you just spare 8man from your identity crisis bullshit for one second?<br>8man just wanted to have fun watching the fishes.<br><br>Not everything has to do with your problems you know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino already told Hachiman in Vol 6 that they can never be friends<br><br> “Didn’t I say it before? That it’s out of the question for me to be friends with you.” <br> “That so…?” <br> “That’s right. I do not lie, after all. <br><br>8man also had this piece of foreshadowing as well in terms of their relationship<br><br> Our statues were constructed from just our names and fragmentary impressions of each other, like that of mosaic, burying one fragment one by one until we were able to make up virtual images of each other. <br> And surely enough, those images probably weren’t even real. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most excellent.</br>  <br>Maybe but Yukino going away but remaining either friends/lovers with him also gets rid of Hachiman's beliefs that relationships will always reset in life<br><br> Relationships won’t reset from moving up a year or going on to college.” <br> “No, they definitely will.” <br> “That applies only to you, Hikigaya. I’m different from you.” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he thinks Yukino doesn't lie <br>Come on, anon. Her entire character (or lack of) is a lie.</br></br>  <br>She is lying about not lying.</br>  <br>maybe 8man actually feeds off her energy to create all the sonnets that magically appear in his head everytime he's alone with her.<br><br>or he simply doesn't mind.</br></br></br>  <br>Would it also be reasonable to think that Yukino doesn't go abroad because she values her friends more? I mean that shows her standing on her two feet making decisions for herself. <br><br>Would the author want Yukino to leave? I understand fully well the the series isn't about romance but rather growth but I think it might be possible that 8man might just take Hiratsuka's advice of: caring for someone just means that you're ready to hurt them, and pick one of the heroines if he realizes his feelings for either one of them.<br><br>What exactly is an "Oregairu" ending?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Would the author want Yukino to leave? <br>Lazy ass character development time skip ending purposes</br></br>  <br><br> What exactly is an "Oregairu" ending? <br><br>In spring time of their third years. Komachi getting accepted in Sobu. All of them in the clubroom. Yukino and 8man reading, Yui and Komachi chatting and Iroha applying makeup to herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not Komachi and Iroha making fun of 8man siscon </br>  <br>Not really, in this case. Most of the really interesting development for her character can be handled in volume 12 proper. Then after that spending some time soul searching isn't at all out of the question, and like  said, it would be a good way to prove 8man wrong about how relationships eventually reset.</br>  <br><br> What exactly is an "Oregairu" ending? <br><br>Something painful for sure, and sad but also to be happy and hopeful about.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In spring time of their third years. Komachi getting accepted in Sobu. All of them in the clubroom. The long table and chairs are replaced by a huge round bed. Tissues and rubber everywhere. The girls take turns to ride the 8. </br>  <br>That would actually be a major + in some cases.</br>  <br> What exactly is an "Oregairu" ending? <br>If it truly something unique to romcoms, hence having it's own name, then you can forget about any girl winning the 8bowl.<br>And given the drama aspect of the LNs, expect something painful.</br></br></br>  I think the heroines grew way too much on me that I want him to end up with one of them. Will it not bode well for me?<br><br>I mean, there's a lot of girls that could be better for him after he gets into uni and the author might just go with that..</br></br>  <br> this is what irohafags actually believe <br> &gt;mfw i'm actually an irohafag </br></br>  <br>Oregairu has changed. It's no longer about hating nice girls, becoming a bear or changing the world. It's an endless series of shitposts, fought by tripfags and memers. Oregairu, and its consumption of life, has become a well-oiled general thread. Oregairu has changed. Tripfags repost tripfag posts, use tripfag memes. Waifus inside their hearts enhance and regulate their shitposting. Anonymous control. Meme control. Emotion control. OP control. Everything is monitored, and kept under control. Oregairu has changed. The age of /8maninhighschool/ has become the age of waifufag harems. All in the name of cute grills doing cute things. And he who controls the OPs, controls history. Oregairu has changed.

It's been so long and there were so many characters that I can't tell.  <br>Tsuredzure would make the most sense phonetically, but I believe the most common romaji systems write the ず sound as "zu".<br>The sound does come off sounding a lot like "dzu" though.</br></br>  <br>There's like 3 chapters preceding this one.<br><br>First was the one featuring the club president who was not yet club president at the time, her senpai graduated leaving the club to her. That guy is her current boyfriend now.<br><br>Second was the one featuring the club president recruiting new members. She ends up recruiting the guy you see in this chapter. That guy obviously joined because he fell in love with her while not knowing about her senpai.<br><br>Third is the guy ending up bringing his childhood friend to the club. The childhood friend loves the guy and hates how close the club pres seems to be with him. This ends up causing an argument, however they accidentally kiss at the end which the club pres sees.<br><br>Which brings us to this chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> With my boyfriend <br>Spica sequel when, I want to see new senpai with ex-senpai stargazing together.</br></br>  man I love this pair  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br><br>well, this is sad</br></br>  <br>thanks op</br>   boyfriend   Has this been outdated yet. <br><br><br>Sweet.</br></br></br>  Holy shit, this lad. Dropping the daisuki like it's hot.  Has anything happened with the tanks or serialization yet?  <br>Sweet I made it this time.<br>I've been tracking one of the mega folders and the uploader has been working on the Shonen Magazine releases since the first week. But they still seem to need a cleaner.<br><br>Folder here: https://mega.co.nz/#F!BBsykZyb!-lmV<wbr>rDQ91OykOffIi_Py8Q</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Holy shit, she fucked up. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OGp<wbr>9P6QvMjY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Delicious.</br>  <br>"Contacts" and "Watching you from afar" are my absolute favourites. Best girl and boy.</br>  <br><br>To be fair, even though it is a bit dickish. It's not really his fault that he's just not interested in her.</br></br>  <br>I'm a personal fan of Rain as when they both realize how much they love each other, I'll die on the spot from diabetes.</br>  <br>Cool.</br>  <br>I really shouldn't get this excited for a ten-page 4koma chapter.<br><br><br>Can someone confirm that Tsurezure Children is the same thing as 4koma Collection? Because MU lists it as an alternate name but also as a spin-off, and I just want to make sure that's an error and that there isn't some untranslated treasure trove of more cute confession shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The chapter released after this is the Rain couple. I can dump and translate if needed.<br><br><br>They're the same. The most recent 4koma collection is the same as the 1st Shonen Mag release under a different title</br></br></br></br>  <br>  I can dump and translate if needed <br>If you could, I would do something for you, except I really can't think of anything I can do for you. What I'm saying is, please do.</br></br>  <br><br>I was wrong there's an interim chapter with sister and trolldere. I'll have a vote to see which is desired first</br></br>  <br>Trolldere</br>  With an amazingly high score of 1-0 it seems I'll be going in chronological order<br><br>The segment is called "Trap"<br><br>Recently, my big brother has been smiling a lot while chatting on LINE. It's probably a girl.<br><br>"Big brother go take a bath!!"<br>"Hm? I'll go later..."<br>"Mom says to go now!!"<br>"F...fine!!"<br><br>Let's see here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> With an amazingly high score of 1-0 <br>Can I still vote for Rain sequel?</br></br>  <br>His password is...still his exam number from his entrance exams.

The wicked bitch that's tricking my big brother<br><br>I'm gonna punish you now!!<br><br><br>It's next after this segment</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Furuya Jun<br>"I'm sorry but can you stop talking to may from now on?"<br>"You're interrupting my studies"<br><br>It's Hotaru-chan!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh!? Why so sudden... Did I do something?? Perhaps... it's because of 'that'?<br><br>'That'..? Did he do something to anger her? It would seem possible if it's this woman...<br><br>"Yes"<br>"Even though you're the one who requested me?"<br><br>... Requested? What?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>Did he borrow notes or something? I don't know what's going on, but I guess I'll just act mad<br><br>"Just forget that boring thing"<br><br>"How cruel!! It was even my first time..."<br><br>First time...? What was??</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Requesting something from big brother<br>Hmmm<br>...that was her first time...<br><br>"Ah! Perhaps..."<br><br>"It's true that I asked you, but I can date anyone can't I?"<br>"Besides, it was my first date too..."<br><br>"I knew it!!" "You don't understand, do you?"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pic forgotten</br>  <br><br>"No way... So that date you were just playing around?"<br><br>"See I knew it!! I thought he came back late the other day, so he went somewhere with this girl..."<br><br>"Then, the sleeping with me was also playing?"<br><br>Huuuuhh!?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So let me get this straight, there's the 4koma we have now and a serial release within the same universe?<br><br>What's the difference? New, exclusive, expanded, etc.</br></br>  <br>Did she say... slept? Did they nap in the afternoon? An afternoon nap date...Big brother's changed hasn't he...<br><br>"It was just sleeping right?"<br><br>"Then what should I do with the child in my belly?"<br><br><br>Serial release releases chapters not published on the web and omake. Btw checked</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, I think best girl has finally been decided. They're all great, but trolldere is a step beyond.</br>  <br>Requested... first time... slept... child...<br><br>That's what she meeeeaaant!?<br><br>(Here is a good internal scream pic)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B...b-b-b...but a child...You can't do that without doing 'that'...when did that happen with my brother...?<br><br>"Is that really my child? Do you have proof?"<br><br>"I only slept with... you, Furuya-kun"<br><br>UUWWAAAAAAA!!<br><br>(Now an external scream)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best tsundere</br>  <br>I kinda hope the mom gets an individual story to tie in somewhere, she's pretty great</br>  <br>"L...lies!! Such a thing... Even though they're still high school kids..."<br>"Huh? Hotaru what're you doing? Looking at other people's phones..."<br><br>"MOOOOOMMM!!"<br>"Eh!? Hotaru?"<br><br>"God... what is it..."<br><br>"HOTARU!?"<br><br>And I'm gonna have 10 min cooldown before next story</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your work is much appreciated!</br>  Next story: It's because of the fever  Which Wakaba would you sushi?  <br>(forgot the 'all' there)<br><br>Recently for some reason I've been spacing out<br><br>In class as well, when I notice I'm looking in weird places<br><br>Then just a little, my chest hurts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The yandere.</br>  <br>(spaaace)<br>"Chii-chan are you ok?"<br><br>"Eh?

It's a cold<br><br><br>See 'Childhood friend'</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Ta...Takano... what's wrong?"<br>"Um...yea... I might be having a fever"<br><br>"Sugawara-kun are you hurt?"<br>"We...well... just a little from club"<br>"The nurse?"<br>"Ah... she went out just a while back..."<br><br>"I see..."<br>"Yeah..."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah right. Thanks.</br>  <br>"U...um... Is the soccer club hard?"<br>"Eh? Um... I guess"<br><br>What am I saying... The conversation won't continue at all. My head's also all spacy, I must think of more topics...<br><br>"...Hey Takano, didn't you come to check a fever or something?"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where can I read the others?  <br>"Th...that's right... I guess I do have a fever..."<br>"I...it's ok..."<br><br>"So...I have to go back to club..."<br>"Ah... wait...!!<br><br>"Eh... ...what?"<br><br>"...... I don't know"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Takano makes my heart go dokidoki.  <br> kuudere and busboy get a threequel <br>YES</br></br>  Somehow, I know this chapter will end with me scanning in frustration.  <br>"...huh?"<br>"Ah... my mistake...!! I don't know where the thermometer is"<br><br>"Ah...ahhh!! Wow that surprised me a bit!!"<br>"S...sorry"<br><br>"You said it with such a red face... My heart skipped a beat"<br><br>Skip<br><br><br>It's moon from this point on. But Danbooru has these two and the next chapter already translated<br><br><br>Yes. It will only get to HNNNG levels from here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HNNG levels reached critical to the point where I skipped the pic</br>  <br><br>Jesus christ</br></br>  <br><br>"No way...!? Was my face that red...?"<br>"I guess...compared to your usual face"<br><br>"No... but... that's not why..."<br>"I understand!!"<br><br>"It's not like you're in love or anything, Takano..."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Translator-anon, thank you. My heart's dying from this chapter alone. It's worth it. <br><br> It's really nice to read something in Japanese and then have the English text to compare it with. I'm going to re-read this series in Japanese now. </br></br></br></br>    <br>"It's a brand new model, so it can get your temperature in 5 seconds"<br>"I...is that so..."<br><br>"I hope... you don't have a fever"<br>"...yeah"<br><br>But... if it's not a fever, then what do I do?<br><br>If it's not a fever, what is this...?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No translation needed.<br><br><br>I will be posting all Shonen mag scans and translating them anon. You can use that for now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is she pregnant?</br>  <br>Did she put the thermometer under her armpit? Is this a thing?</br>  <br>"...I knew it, I seem to have a tiny fever"<br>"Seriously!? Then you should go home early!!"<br><br>"I have to get back to club, so take care!!"<br>"Y...yeah thanks"<br><br>If it's not a fever, I wonder what it is...<br><br>10 min break again, then off to next chapter<br><br><br>I've done it before. It's to prevent mouth germs but it's just as accurate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always had to do that when I was a kid.</br>  <br>That is how all my thermometer were at home. I was actually confused when the nurse at my school practically shoved a thermometer in my mouth.</br>  Oh man she seems less deadpan in this one.<br><br>Hurry up and confess already dammit.</br></br>  <br>I always use a thermometer like this. My mother is a nurse and she always put it under my armpit. <br>I never saw people put it in their mouths in real life to be honest.</br></br>  Monster Musume started on pixiv, so surely this can get animated shorts as well, right?<br><br><br>RIght?</br></br></br>  <br>It got a serialization, so it's not impossible.</br>  <br>Let's hope together.</br>  <br>This breaks my code, but this is a snapshot from the Mag scans. Make of it as you will<br><br><br>As long as they don't overblow the misunderstandings and moe and drop the quality, I'll be happy</br></br></br></br>  <br>of course, it's an old thermometer. you wouldn't put pic related close to your mouth right?<br>and modern thermometers do not require to even touch your body.<br>was there a moment for you mericans where you were in between those two and put something in your mouth?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure you can overblow the moe on this. You just have to keep your delinquent moe and your shy moe straight.</br>  Righto, so here is where the web release (36) and the scans (1) meet. From this point on, I'd take the scans as chronologically ordered and post web releases. I will use the scans since he colored them<br><br>Beginning (Rumor on web release)<br>According to a rumor, Toujou-san from my class seems to have a crush on me<br><br>I wasn't aware of this up to now but if I ask about that...<br><br>...huh? What?<br><br>...wha? Is she mad...?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Before I move on, you guys want 1 or 2 comics at a time?</br>   not putting the thermometer in your ass   <br>My bad on this one. But seriously, 1 or 2 comics?<br><br>Comic 1<br><br>Wait a minute, is something not right?<br>I feel like I'm being glared at...<br><br>"Wh...what!? Ogiue-kun!?

More like she hates my guts!!<br><br>"We...well... since I'm going home, don't mind me really..."<br><br>"Does Ogiue-kun...also like books?"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're too adorable. I want them her to realize her feeling already.</br>  <br>Whatever you are more comfortable with.</br>  <br>Whichever way is easier for you.</br>  <br>Anon, you have to be 18 or older to browse this website.</br>  <br>I know right, I can't take it anymore.</br>  <br>I shall keep posting 2.

She completely hates me...<br><br>"Bu...but I'm happy!"<br><br>Comic 2<br><br>"Eh... why..?"<br>"Be...because... you would be if there was someone with the same hobby right?"<br><br>"It...it's not like its because I can be happy with Ogiue-kun and my hobbies, because it's not like that!! Don't get mistaken!"<br><br>....Eh. Is that so?<br><br>Then... Why are you angry?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>C-cute</br>  <br>Comic 1<br><br>"Um... perhaps... you have something to say to me"<br>"Ah!!

This entire series is perfect for an 8 minute format.</br>  Not that I mind to see it again, but I think this story was already translated some time ago.  <br>Probably was, but it's the last page already<br><br>Comic 1<br><br>"I...I never really thought about you like that Ogiue-kun!!

For some reason gaijin just never used it, even if they were using the site the series was on now and pre-vol, which literally says it in the URL. The Tsuredure Children vols include fixes, proper order of chapters, along with additional ".5" sections placed in between chapters that aren't available elsewhere AFAIK. Various pre-vol sources the author setup likely had a chance to have their own weird upload order, including the main site. The listings differ from the vols, and there are also printed release only chapters. The webcomic didn't get fix updates, so you can check the silly changes if you want. To add to this tl;dr, might as well address the romanization of the series. The "zu" portion is like は, the most simplified proper form is "du", but people will be using "wa" instead of "ha". In the same sense, "wa" will let gaijin pronounce things better, but it isn't right. The pages, site name etc are using du though.</br>  When I grow up I want to be as based as OP.  <br>Forgot pic</br>  <br><br>Fucking Spaghettiman</br></br>  <br>I wonder if stuff in this video actually happens in Japan.<br><br>Just can't imagine it when I look at the western world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Comic 1<br>Uwahh!!

Fortunately, she provided the entire plot to her illustrator who will take up her work, so we'll still get more MC Yumi, but depending on how extensive her notes were the English translation and correct military terminology could suffer.

From where I'm from, we've always been told that a weapon comes with a responsability, and if you don't want the later, you don't deserve the former either. Yet /k/ is full of retards going "m-m-muh 2nd" as an excuse for being assholes instead of as a right to exercise said responsability (see <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;27975955  for details). <br>Such is life.<br>Sorry for rant.</br></br></br>  <br>It's ok, between the neo conservatives, 50centers, and trolls/retards the quality of /k/ has gone down over the past few years and it's ok to be mad about that.</br>  <br>What really pains me (bot asspain, regular pain, whih is sadder) is that Miho Nishizumi porbably understands it more than any of them going "hur dur Chinese cartoons".
