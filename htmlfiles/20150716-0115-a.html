I'm sick of this shit.</br></br>  <br><br>What did those two hope to accomplish?<br><br>The Elites are above their league and Juha could crush them with his reiatsu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. All the visored do was jobbed.</br>  <br>I remember when every was joking that foot was Don Kanoji, and then they were right. It was great.</br>  <br> spoilers <br> on a tuesday </br></br>  <br>Early chapters this week. Rejoice, /a/non.</br>  When does kubo die  <br>If they're not dead,then it was probably ishida, which means he'll show up to pick up bazz</br>  <br> Grimmjow is still chasing Askin <br>I hope this turns into extreme chasey 2015 and it's a year before he's caught.</br></br>  <br>So much for Grimmjow speed.</br>  <br> Grimmjow went from "who was sword?" to "stop the pigeon" <br>Classic Kubo.</br></br>  <br> we waited 3 years for sword </br>  I just wanna see some more bankais<br><br>Shunsui and Urahara mainly, but the vizards and aizen would be much obliged</br></br>  <br><br>Was it only three years? Shit, I guess it was.</br></br>  These 2 are the greatest.<br><br> Nel is the worst. </br></br>  <br> there were actually people who thought it wasn't him <br> all those arguments about whether he was dead or not over those 3 years <br>It makes me cringe how retarded people were about that.</br></br></br>  <br>I have those same exact pair of scissors in my kitchen......<br><br>does it mean?.....</br></br></br>  <br>Nel is objectively best Bleach girl, what the hell are you on about.</br>  Well the matchups sure are unexpected. Did grimmjow just got owned by askin gift ball?  Wan piss is out so Bleach should be out soonish.  I know they are gonna let Kubo finish it anyway but I really wonder why bleach is suffering so hard in the ratings.<br><br>Issue #34<br>Assassination Classroom (Cover and LEad CP)<br>Shokugeki no Soma<br>One Piece<br>Best Blue (25p, CP)<br>My Hero Academia<br>HaikyÅ«!!<br>Shoujou Fukkyuu Recovery Q (Golden Future Cup 1st Entry, One Shot by Mitsuhara Subaru)<br>Straighten Up!

Maybe when she turns into a women she'll be better.</br>  What was even the point of bringing the Sternritters along? They basically killed themselves.  <br>Well never hurt to try.</br>  <br><br>Kubo is being very harsh with his characters, he is not even giving them the chance to have one last decent fight, the same is gonna happen with the vice-captains, there is really not point in bringing them along either.</br></br>  <br>For the first time, I'm actually getting the impression he just wants to bring Bleach to an end. Whether it's because he's tired or because of its fading popularity, the more this arc goes on the more he seems to be rushing through things.</br>  <br>Everywhere else is already fucked, where else are they going.</br>    everyone jobs, the chapter <br><br>But GODAMNIT, I refuse to believe Liltotto/Gigi/Bazz are dead, did they seriously went against their broken ex-boss who has gotten even more overpowered without any plan ? And what's more this happen right right away at the start of the battle ? Cut this shit Kubo, I want more of them.<br><br>Though Giselle looks as "dead" as in her previous defeats so there is still a chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yhwach has future sight. Whatever they plan will be useless in front of his eyes.</br>  <br>Because Jump rankings are mostly about what series Jump wants to try and push, and theres no reason to push a series that doesn't have an anime and is in the last arc.</br>  <br>So ? They could still try something besides attacking him straight ahead like retards. He's not omnipotent. Might as well say the same thing for the shinigamis and we know they're gonna win. Why making them back to set all the 'abandoned soldiers" revenge if it's only to make them die right at the start of the battle ? Especially when it was shown Liltotto is far from being stupid.</br>  <br> Bad guys want to join you in fighting the main bad guy <br> They run off to their deaths while occupying strong enemies <br>Two birds one stone.</br></br></br>  <br> I really wonder why bleach is suffering so hard in the ratings. <br>because focus on boring characters. At least the esada were fighitng against fan favorites or where fan favourite themselves. But who the ever living hell cares about bazzbe and lord toofsy?<br>Blue balling us with a few anel of grimjow, el, aizen and kempachi before changing focus didn't help.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no fading popularity, its been pretty steady since this arc has been going on.</br>  Hype  <br>They foolishly try to get revenge and fail, showing how strong Toofsy and Bach are. I see no problem with this at all.</br>  <br>What in the world is this thing?</br>  <br>Yeah but that's the thing, they didn't occupy shit. Ideally you'd come up with a plan to make them useful before you use them as fodder.</br>  <br>They should know their strengh way more than the shinigami, there is foolish try and being retarded. Might as well help a bit the shinigamis to get all the changes on their side. It's like they weren't even trying.</br>  <br> Zaraki and Mayuri double team <br>This has the potential to be one of the craziest fights yet. Hope Kubo doesn't fuck it up.</br></br>  <br>*all the chances on their side</br>  Why did Kubo have to kill off Gigi? But at least now things are getting interesting, Kubo has my attention. Oh and I guess Hisagi is also dead so no bankai from him.   Hisagi snipped and dies like a literal bitch <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></br>  <br>I always keep repeating Ken and Mayuri gets way too much screentime when others characters would deserve some, but damn, this duo is way too good.</br>  <br>I fear it's another fake hyppe that will be followed by some asspull ass resurection to mirrror what happened with the sternritters a few chapters ago.<br>Might b Orihime, Mayuri, or Squad 0, most won't stay dead.</br></br>  <br>And he has a particular hatred for Kensei and Mashiro too, they both jobbed off panel by never mentioning them ever again for the rest of the ark.</br>  <br>They aren't trustworthy enough to actually plan around or rely on, but they are disposable enough to let them tag along and rush in ahead.<br><br><br>The sternritter wanted revenge for themselves, even though they knew they could never win. I couldn't really see them actually seeking help from the shinigami.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> They actually think Hisagi is dead <br>Kek.<br><br><br> Mayuri <br> Too much screentime <br>No such thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The X's shot seemed to go through around where the heart/lungs are, and his shots go through everything. And you know Kubo and his hearts.</br>  <br>Try reading Bakuman to know about Jumps inner workings thanks</br>  <br>Oh, Kubo will definitely fuck it up.</br>  <br> They actually think Hisagi is dead <br>Just like Kira is not dead, right? Kakked at Kubodrone.</br></br>   Miracle is the team joke more than levar hiself <br> power is literally miracles <br><br>I can already see the resurection plot coming.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a bit of a difference between getting shot and having half of your torso blown away. It also seems that you're forgetting the golden rule of Bleach deaths, that no matter how injured someone is, as long as a top tier healer gets to them before they die they can be saved. Hisagi might be dead and he might not be, but its too soon to assume for sure and be mad about it.</br>   Fuck it... I'm gonna kill it. <br><br>Kenpachy best Bleach.</br></br>  rip in holes hisagi  <br>The only thing worth being mad is how shit Bleach became.</br>  Grimjow, more like Grimjobber amirite?<br> cafeine AND milk poisoning <br>he's literrally sharting himself to death</br></br>  Hisagi will survive because the sniper didn't blow his head off.  <br>If you don't like it why are you reading the chapter as soon as it comes out and then discussing it in the thread?</br>   liltotto portrayed since the beginning as a caculating rational person <br> dies after attacking the very source of her power heads on <br>This is the worst. Gigi being tupid is OK but liltotto as literally disposed from the tory there with no dignnity</br></br>  <br>Reminder that when an arrancar uses resurreccion their wounds are healed.</br>  <br>It was obvious from the beginning that the sternritter were launching a rage filled suicide attack. The only people upset by this are liltotto fans who wanted her to survive.<br> MUH WAIFU IS 2 SMART 2 DIE LIEK DAT </br></br>   Liltotto, Giselle, Grimmjow and Hisagi literally one-shooted <br><br>Also, based Askin Nakk Le Varr and Lille<br><br> None of them died, right?! Right?! Gigi is still alive, huh? Huh?! </br></br></br></br>    tfw Grimmjow got really beaten like this and will be out of the battle for months <br>  tfw Askin does exactly the same thing to Nel in the next chapter and it works </br>   Hisagi down <br> Grimmjow down <br> Rebellious Quincy down <br> Kenpachi nearly decommissioned <br><br>Not a bad chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His power is OP when he doesn't explain it to people.</br>  <br> kenpachi <br> nearly decomissioned <br><br>it's like you haven't read this manga ever.</br></br></br></br>    Rebellious Stern gets offscreen'd after doing nothing <br><br><br>I just want a Liltotto/Gigi/ZBambi/Bazz SoL spinoff in the real world damnit.</br></br></br>    <br>yeah and?<br><br>kenpachi with an arm twisted is nowhere near defeated.</br></br></br>  <br>If they stopped to get him or heal him they'd also be sniped.</br>  <br>Liltotto and Giselle got beaten off screen, we don't know if they were one shot or not. Also Hisagi was already injured and a weakling so meh.</br>  If ASKIN is dealing with Grimmjow Ichigo and Co<br>PERNIDA: Kenpachi and Mayuri<br>LILE with Shunsui Urahara and them<br>who will URYU and GERARD end up facing when the only people missing are Yoruichi and Aizen. And I doubt Yoruichi hopped over to another plate and I definitely doubt they let aizen go off on his own</br></br></br>  So who will appear behind Barro next chapter?  <br>He can't use 2 hands. That's like not having a Bankai.</br>  <br>I think our lord and savior Aizen will crush gerard with reiatsu, and uryu will have a round with ginjo and facebook.</br>  <br> &gt; tfw Askin does exactly the same thing to Nel in the next chapter and it works <br>Exactly what I'm expecting. But Kubo might Kubo and reveal that Nel's ability to eat other entities spirit energy allows her to adapt to it or something.</br></br>  <br>Given how some of these fucks didn't even use their Bankai against Aizen, I doubt it matters.</br>  <br>I know it isn't really lined up to happen, but I really hope that Gerard ends up fighting Chad. I don't know why, but I think that would be a really cool matchup.</br>    Orihime, Chad and Ganju are looking for Askin on their own <br>  Separation themselves when most of the group is pretty weak to begin with <br><br>Why the fuck is no one mentioning this.</br></br></br>  <br>SOi fon uses bankai kills everyone close<br>Shunsui uses bankai ends up getting everyone killed<br>Hitsugaya uses Tenso Jurin in bankai accidentally freezes everyone<br>Yamamoto uses bankai everyone incinerates rom being close to him<br><br>See why sometimes bankai is a bad idea in group fights?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Parnkgjas, "C", going full zit.</br>  <br>because they don't matter</br>  <br>he will drop his pants and use his dick</br>  <br> orihime rejecting the doses from Askin <br> kills him by healing him and putting him to a normal level of tolerance becuse he is constantly poisoned or some shit <br><br>it would be a curious matchup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Askin can't do shit to Orihime with his power. He'd have to got beat her up old school and we have no proof he isn't fodder tier without his ability.</br>  <br>I would be genuinely impressed if Kubo makes Orihime relevant, especially when her power just works too well against Askin.</br>  <br>  All of the group job against Askin's power <br>  tfw Orihime kick beat him </br></br>  <br>Even for Ken chan, it's still his whole arm.</br>  <br>No Kendo</br>  <br><br><br><br>KUBO MAKE THIS HAPPEN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, a lot of them (soi fon especially) were too weak/tired to even be able to use bankai by that point. The only people still healthy enough to bankai against Aizen would have been Shinji and Kyoraku, and they both have weird zanpakto that would lead to friendly fire.</br>  <br><br><br>this would be gold if it happens</br></br></br>  <br>Akin can do whatever he wants because if you don't know what's going on you just fall dead.</br>  <br><br>Every fucking time. Every fucking time Kenpachi is paired up against these crazy abstract powered weirdos, and every time his raw power blows them away.<br><br>His only appropriate fights were Noitra and his reigai self.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gremmy is the only person hes fought like that</br>   people think Ken lost his arm for real <br> with Mayuri around him <br>He'll gladly zombify im and you know it</br></br>  <br>That's not how you spell Yoruichi. It's even right there in her name, "Ichi".</br>  <br> Ishiin </br>  <br><br>Not only Mayuri, the royal guards may still have something to say.<br><br>Maybe.</br></br></br></br>    <br>That's not Rukia, the reigning queen supreme.</br>  <br>This is only the second time though.</br>  <br>Not tall enough to do that, she'd be facing his dick.</br>  <br>If we're talking about flat tiny girls Liltotto is better.</br>  <br>that's a very cinematic page</br>  Thread needs some most popular girl.   when did you fall into the impression you didn't see kyoka suigetsu? <br> it was momo all along who took all those hits </br>  Just like to note, Hisagi probably ain't dead. He was wounded to attract attention of the medic who will be killed. Think more that he is bait for Hanatarou/Isane/other healers.  <br>hisagi vs nigger round 2</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  Why do I get the feeling that this match-up : Kenpachi &amp; Mayuri vs Pernida is important? That the revelation of Pernida's identity will be shocking to the two of them?<br>Is there somebody who could be connected to both Kenpachi and Mayuri that is now Pernida?</br>  <br>The only ones that would be shocking to Kenpachi would be Unohana or Yachiru, and I don't think Mayuri would care much about them. I doubt it would be somebody we know.</br>  <br>if it's yachiru everyone will shit bricks.</br>  why did the chapters release today?<br><br>will this be the schedule again?</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't really like it but at least it would be something other than the awful "yachiru is sword" theory.</br>  <br> will this be the schedule again? <br>Nope. The magazine simply came out earlier than normal in Japan and as a result we got the chapter earlier.</br></br>  <br>Oh I see.<br><br>I was just surprised.</br></br></br>  NIGGA AND PANDA TRANSLATIONS ARE SO FUCKING DIFFERENT THEY'RE BASICALLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CHAPTERS<br><br>WHICH ONE IS THE BETTER ONE?</br></br>  <br>pernida's reveal will be a  twist </br>  <br>mangastream always unless they go full retard then wait for Cnet or Badkarma on mangahelpers</br>  <br>..c'mon Carlos, not now!<br>But I admit, I chuckled.</br></br>   Grimmjow is dead <br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br>    FINALLY some plot progression. And thinning the numbers, too, which is a good thing.  <br>You say that but then shit like this comes up.<br> ain't no shame in kinging like kong retard </br></br>  <br><br>Don't think the numbers willg et too thin, the royal guards will do somethign for sure, like revive all the injured/dead shinigami or some other shit.<br><br> I am watching you! <br><br> how are the tracks going? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  What was Akins really planning to do back here  <br><br> unless they go full retard then wait for Cnet or Badkarma on mangahelpers </br></br>   It'll be 100+ chapters until Rukia and Ichigo see each other again   I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a Bleach chapter.<br><br>I literally don't give the slightest fuck about any character in the manga. That wasn't the case before and I was always looking forward to someone's fight.<br><br> About the only thing that might make me interested again is if Ichigo led Orihime into an alley and made out with her on-screen, as he's groping her all over. </br></br></br></br>  <br>This disgusting shit taste.</br>  <br>the same everyone else is planning, to kill everyone.</br>  <br><br> low test babby <br><br>sickening</br></br></br></br>  <br> We have two plus years before the delusional shippers start shitting up the threads again <br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>Cool blog bro. If you don't like it then stop reading it and browsing the threads.</br>  <br> wanting Ichigo/Orihime <br> calling another person sickening </br></br>  <br>I remember when wanting Rukia and Ichigo to interact didn't mean you were a shipper.</br>  <br><br>The only way is to get off the ride. <br><br>I can't believe people are still watching Bleach.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> being a Rukia pedophile <br> haven't already offed yourself </br></br></br>  <br> brings up Rukia all of a sudden <br>Someone's defensive.</br></br>  <br> people complain about the pacing being slow because side characters get fights <br> people complain when Kubo offscreens unimportant fights to speed up the pace <br>No matter what he does he can't win with /a/.<br><br><br>Wanting them to interact doesn't make you a shipper, but them interacting always brings out the shippers in full force.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching <br><br>if only....</br></br></br>  <br> implying people other than ichiruki shipper are passionate enough to bitch about ichihime </br>  <br>Literally anyone who wants shipperfags to fuck off will.<br><br>That said, fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't want good material because it may bring out shippers? What the fuck is wrong with you?</br>  <br> good material <br>Well thats really more of an opinion than anything else, personally I find most of Ichigo and Rukia's interactions either boring or annoying. But anyway, I never said I don't want them to interact just that I was glad it wasn't going to happen for awhile.</br></br>  <br><br> hating shipping <br><br>What are you, gay?</br></br></br></br>  <br> round 2 <br><br>the number of times Hisagi has gotten KO'd, even though he's supposed to have gotten stronger and show a Bankai is just disgusting</br></br></br>  Pictured: the only good thing about this trainwreck of a manga.<br><br>Everything else is just meme characters (i.e. Kenpachi, Aizen, Mayuri), stereotypes, filler, asspulls, needlessly extensive exposition, and powerlevels.</br></br>  <br> I find most of Ichigo and Rukia's interactions either boring or annoying </br>  <br>I'm not 200 lbs overweight, or mentally unstable, or a NEET, or a tumblrwhale, or retarded, or even unreasonably stubborn.<br><br>You can keep doing what you like with your meager pitiful life, just keep that shit away from here so we can get on with our meager and pitiful lives.</br></br></br>  <br> If you don't like shitty tsunderes and boring glances you must be gay! </br>  <br> our </br>  <br>You're on 4chan are you not?</br>  <br>Absolute shit tier opinion. Rukia isn't even the best girl, hell she isn't even the best shinigami girl.</br>  <br> The fights we get to see are repetetive and slow as fuck, you can predict the outcome before they even start <br> Meantime characters whose powers we rarely see see get ofscreen fights <br><br> WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU GUISE WHATEVER KUBO DOES YOU COMPLAIN </br></br></br></br>  <br>Another delusional opinion. Such a simple fanbase.</br>  <br>Dont act like people knew MAsk de Masculine was going to destroy Kensei and Rose</br>   Bleach's fanbase doesn't appreciate best girl. <br>It must be hard to recognize quality when you're used to shit.</br>  <br> el aizen </br>  NOOOOOOOOOO LILTOTTO!  <br> actually wanting to see Grimmjow, Aizen, and Kenpachi instead of based Chad and Orihime. </br>   just be a good boy  <br> be a good boy <br> BOY <br><br>kek'd, Gilette was the trap all along!</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;The fights we get to see are repetetive and slow as fuck, you can predict the outcome before they even start <br> &gt;Meantime characters whose powers we rarely see see get ofscreen fights <br>This seems like a decent argument but it doesn't even remotely apply to this chapter. You're saying you want fights with obvious outcomes to be skipped, yet you want to see the weak quincy fighting against the quincy boss when we all know he can easily defeat them without any effort? You want to see fights where we see powers we haven't gotten to see, but you're mad about a fight involving 3 characters whose powers we all know? The fight had an obvious outcome and wouldn't show anything we haven't already seen, so why would you want to waste the time of it happening on screen?</br></br></br>  What happened?<br>Why a new one on Wednesday?</br>  <br> only Rukia fans are shippers and people who don't even read Bleach </br>  <br> &gt;unless they go full retard <br>which is their natural state</br></br>  <br>Why would people with good enough taste to appreciate Rukia waste their time with such a terrible series?</br>  What's this 10/10 character doing in a 3/10 series?  <br>I didn't realize pedophilia was considered good taste.</br>  Askin continues to be the most amusing Quincy and we're finally probably gonna see Pernida's face next chapter. And Gerard seems like he'll be fun to watch when he gets focus.<br><br>I'm guessing that Yoruichi went to get the stuff her brother brought with him, as she disappeared from Ichigo's group. But Ichigo really is an idiot sometimes as splitting the group in hostile territory is never a good idea.<br><br>Anyway, while I did expect it, it's still a shame that Lilitotto and Giselle were off-paneled as I was at least hoping to see them at least start the fight.<br><br>Well, including the entertaining Zaraki and Mayuri interactions this chapter was pretty decent I suppose.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> callinga one 6/10 a 10/10 and a 4/10 a 3/10 <br>0/10</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Fuck off, samefag</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As expected of an earnest reader of Bleach, your brain is the size of a pea.</br>  spoiler 794<br><br>chapter about sabo<br>http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>261</wbr></br></br></br>  meh  <br>so, he just controls birds? wtf</br>  <br>Is that the true Doflamingo?</br>  <br>Damn Franky really fucked up himself, how did he even manage to operate on himself?</br>  <br>Could be the power of a different member of the Revolutionary Army or a species of animals that they've trained to use for transport.</br>  What a pointless chapter. And hiatus again.  <br>Oh my fucking god<br>Praise Oda, praise the flamingo king. And of course praise the kindred spirit who asked for this.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I thinks he's giving his flamingo friends their own army of toys so they can imitate him.<br>The best part is Doflamingo covering his face though, because there is no way to know if it's just to hide to face or out of embarassment.</br></br>  wow mangastream was first.<br><br>fuck youuuu mangapanda</br></br>  WHERE the FUCK is my 2 page spread victory feast  Shit chapter.<br>We didn't learn anything new.<br>Sabo's amnesia was forced and pointless.<br>Only good thing was Robin's new look. She's become an 11/10.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Forced </br>  <br> Doffy is actually the glasses itself <br>  the human body is just a puppet controlled by his DF </br></br>  <br>No time for victory feast. Sanji and the rest could be in danger right now.</br>  <br> Sabo's amnesia was forced and pointless. <br>As fucking stupid as the amnesia excuse is, it was pretty much the only thing he could write that made any sense. It's the only excuse for not having Sabo show up before this that made any sense at all.<br><br>Of course, it would have been better if Oda had not tried to force Sabo into the story like this, then he wouldn't have had to come up with an excuse in the first place.<br><br>Sloppy writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We got a sleepover with Bellamy instead. It's cool.</br>  Zoro is cute! CUTE!  <br>http://www.mangamint.com/one-piece-<wbr>794?page=4<br><br>Chapter is here. Should i Dump?</br></br></wbr></br>  ... well i think sabo's gonna die too <br>mera mera is cursed</br>  <br> not getting chapter from mangastream </br>  <br><br>Almost everything is sloppy to you nerds nowadays.<br><br>Do you even enjoy things anymore?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow. Two watermarks from different sites. <br>Top of the line pic there champ.<br><br>Posting watermarked shit should count as advertising and be a bannable offense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm satisfied with this.</br>  <br>Why ? It's on mangastream. Let them earn their advertisement money instead of spoiling it/giving it to these frauds http://readms.com/r/one_piece/794/2<wbr>860/1</wbr></br>  <br>The fact that he had to come up with an excuse means that it was unneeded and sloppy. Don't fucking write something in if you hadn't planned it from the beginning. ESPECIALLY if you then have to make excuses so it makes sense in the context of the story so far.</br>  how could sabo knows about the mera-mera in dressrosa?  <br>I doubt Oda has thought that far yet. He is clearly making up the story as he goes now.<br>But don't worry, whatever excuse he comes up with, the fans will eat it up and defend him online.</br></br>  <br>Well what makes sense to you then? Amnesia is a valid explanation. Also don't be an autist, it's completely fine to write something unplanned.</br>  <br> Don't fucking write something in if you hadn't planned it from the beginning <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br></br>  <br>it was the reward for tournament dumbass</br>  <br>Because doffy announced it the day before?</br>  <br>fuck uuuuuuuuuuuu</br>  <br>Did you forget the part about how Doffy advertised it and thats why there were so many big shots at the tournament?</br>  <br>How was this not sloppy writing?<br>Oda introduced Sabo out of nowhere after Marineford, because he decided he needs a 3rd 'brother' as an heir for the MeraMera.<br>But than he had to come up with a reason for him not be at said war.<br>So he he went the easiest was possible, amnesia.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just post from wherever I read from. You guys never complain when its a panga manda trasnlation</br></br>  <br>Amnesia made enough sense to me, but maybe that's because Bleach has shifted the balance so far toward absurdity that I can accept almost anything now.</br>  <br> Well what makes sense to you then? <br>Not making up a character and trying to write him in the backstory halfway through. <br>Luffy having a second "brother" that was never mentioned up until that flashback arc, and him never having any contact or anything to do with the story until now. Amnesia, it's fucking absurd.</br></br></br>  <br>Your fanboy is showing.<br> Oh, i totally forgot: Luffy had a third brother. <br> Sorry for not even giving the slightest hint in the last decade </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I'm suprised that he would pull that shit when the revolutionary army and dragon in particular always had Luffy's bounty hanging around the place. <br><br>I'm pretty much convinced by now that Oda is dead. Chapters are slow as fuck and Hiatus every 2 weeks</br></br></br>  <br>Because shitty as it is, mangapanda actually does their own translation, dumbass.</br>  <br> out of nowhere <br> the third sake cup was clearly visible in flashback panels before Ace even died <br>Don't blame the master for your own stupidity.</br></br></br>  is this narutoforums now<br>fuck</br>  Oda's not even attempting to hide it anymore  <br> Yeah I'm suprised that he would pull that shit when the revolutionary army and dragon in particular always had Luffy's bounty hanging around the place.  <br>Exactly, how did this particular news story trigger him to cure his amnesia and suddenly remember everything? Ace and Luffy would have had their faces plastered all over newspapers countless times before, and that never made him wake up from his amnesia? <br>It's so ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>THis made no fucking sense. I said you retarded shit that no one complains when I link from mint when the translation is a panda. Now youre bitching because I guess i should feel sorry for stream because they are the better of the two evils. I do the links and dumps every week and have never gotten a complaint.</br>  <br>Sabo was foreshadowed before the war.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Unless someone comes out and says otherwise Oda is either dead or dying. The recent chapters have been the worse I have read in some time</br>  <br> the third sake cup was clearly visible in flashback panels before Ace even died <br> before Ace even died <br>How many chapters before?</br></br></br>  <br>Getting your memory back would mean a heavy trigger of sorts.<br>Bounty posters only show their faces and the prices.<br>Sabo read a newspaper clipping complete with info like the Mera. He most likely saw Luffy's name there as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  Another one for the "why doesn't he smile anymore" collection  <br>Does it even fucking matter?<br><br>You claimed Oda didn't foreshadow or plan Sabo. Go back to your whine circlejerk.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck, are you twelve ? Anyways you shouldn't do that shit for panda either. Anons are grownup enough that they know where to find the chapter. They don't need you, the attention whore who actually think he useful, to link it for them.<br>And yes, I was the one who linked to mangastream. Why ? Because this is release day, and I don't want the average lazy twelve years old coming to this thread to follow the wrong link you posted. I wouldn't have had to do this if you hadn't posted a shitty link first.<br>Now please go back to naruto forums.</br></br></br>  <br> moving goalposts </br>  Is this for the eventual "Episode of Sabo" special?  <br>Foreshadowed him what, 300, 400, 500 chapters into the series? Stop being a shit eating fanboy.</br>  <br> You claimed Oda didn't foreshadow or plan Sabo <br>And that's true. That sake cup panel was drawn 25 chapters before Sabo was first mentioned. <br>Considering OP had 500+ chapters at that time, that's still a last minute idea, especially if you have any idea how mangaka work.<br>No one here says that Oda came up with Sabo a day before his first appearance. <br>I don't get why you desperately try to defending Oda.<br>Everyone makes mistakes, especially in such a long running manga. Just look at Shanks and the Sea King.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I link to Mint because of all the manga sites on the net their updates are the fastest for all the manga that I read and they host stuff other sites wouldn't have up. Why should i run in between sites to see which ones have the manga up when I can just go to one place. stay mad stream fag</br>   put a water mill where there's no river <br>Sasuga Kyros.</br>  <br>Stop making excuses for Oda.</br>  <br>How can they be the fastest if they are just reuploading from others? Are you dumb?</br>  <br><br> panel was drawn 25 chapters before Sabo was first mentioned <br>So he still foreshadowed him.<br><br>Call me whatever you want <br>it's more pathetic defending an argument with holes just because they're afraid of being labeled a fanboy or shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> feeding traffic money to frauds who only take the time to upload the work of others instead of giving it to the people who actually did the shit <br>If you don't see the problem, then there's nothing I can do for you. You just weren't raised well enough. I hope you die smothered by your own ingratitude someday.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather make excuses for an accomplished author than be someone who makes excuses for his own /a/utist self.</br>   people seriously defending amnesia ITT <br>It's literally the cheapest plot tool</br>  <br>Volume 58, chapter 558, on the 3rd box of the 11th page.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Oda will show you the reason there's a watermill in the next few chapters. If not, we will make one up. <br>Stop criticizing the master!</br></br>  <br>You didn't read my post did you. This is a first for stream their chapter update wouldnt come until later in the day. I wouldnt be looking for the chapter on stream till about 2pm est. Now anon what i\I'm saying to you is that as soon as the scanlators release the scans wether it be stream or panda it would be up on mint. Why would I be searching back and forth on both sites when mint has it up within minutes of it going up on either.</br>  <br>why the fuck are you so mad anon? I would only understand your anger if you work for stream. If not stop getting your panties in a bunch about net traffic.</br>  <br>Fuck off cancer, supporting online readers and especially ones that steal from others should be bannable.</br>  <br>Yeah! That's total bullshit. Why didn't Oda foreshadow everything that would happen over the course of the manga during the first 20 chapters?</br>  <br>Foreshadowing doesn't mean Oda had the idea of Sabo from the beginning, you Idiot.<br>I said Oda introduced Sabo out of nowhere, because he needed a new character tied to Luffy and Ace.<br>And that cup panel shows that. He wrote Marineford and all that fighting and then came up with the idea of a 3rd brother. But that idea wasn't fleshed out. That's why he drew the tiniest shadows so he could play it out as foreshadowing or, if he decided to drop the idea of a 3rd brother, it wouldn't matter because 99,99% of the readers didn't even notice it.<br>And when he actually introduced Sabo, he still needed a reason for him not being at the Marineford war. <br>And all he could think of was amnesia. Sabo lost his memories and gained them back in 10 pages. and it doesn't even make sense, because like people said, he should have seen Luffy's and Aces's bounty flyer WAY earlier.<br>tl;dr: You suck Oda cock and are the reason why OP fans getting more and more hated on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If youre so mad at this you should be mad about mangastream basically robbing oda and jump of their revenue. Fucking autist</br>  <br><br>Actually I wouldn't be surprised if Kyros just grinded the stuff by making the mill turn with his own brute strength. Because he's badass like that.</br></br>  <br>There was no need to foreshadow anything, he should have introduced Sabo a long time ago. A third fucking brother with a nicely convenient amnesia, give me a fucking break.</br>  <br> being this mad <br> &gt;being this summer </br></br>  <br>I'm not mad. I'm just appalled.<br> unironically posting 9gag tier reaction pics <br>And I was right to.<br>Maybe in a few years you'll start posting pepes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Foreshadowing doesn't mean Oda had the idea of Sabo from the beginning, you Idiot. <br>You didn't say that. <br><br>You said Oda didn't foreshadow Sabo period.<br>Which is a lie.<br>You're just a Sabo hater trying to justify his hate.<br>amnesia is literally the only thing that could justify Sabo yet you hate it because it explains everything?<br>And you call that lazy?<br><br>What a retarded fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   another hiatus <br>also was Sabo talking to the birds? Who or what are they?</br>  <br> &gt;not realizing that scanlation on a whole is stealing. <br><br>At the end of the day sites like panda and stream are stealing from jump. So your argument holds no weight</br></br></br>  <br>All four puppets are from the Wizard of Oz, is this foreshadowing anything with the Kidd alliance?</br>  <br> You're just a Sabo hater <br> hater <br>Opinion discarded. Go back writing under Youtube videos of "Epic One Piece Moments"</br></br></br>  <br> he should have seen Luffy's and Aces's bounty flyer WAY earlier. <br>I'm sure seeing a bunch of faces without context is enough to bring someone's memories back.<br><br>Unlike something that has information on it and probably mentions Luffy's name as well too, like a newspaper report.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and should websites like mangafox or mangamint disappear no one would miss them because they don't actually do shit.</br>  <br> amnesia is literally the only thing that could justify Sabo <br>Yes, because Oda wrote himself into a corner. Do you even follow the discussion or do you just randomly reply to comments and write bullshit?</br></br>  <br> 9gag tier reaction pics <br>Nigga leave. All these may mays came for the shithole you're posting on now</br></br>  <br>That's retarded, why would Sabo have been introduced sooner? In what situation would it possibly have made any sense to introduce him?</br>  <br>What the fuck am I supposed to call you then?<br><br>This hating on a drawing is pathetic man.<br>You don't have any reason to discredit Oda besides disliking the character.</br></br></br></br>  Crow zoan fruit user?<br><br>Also Bellamy is recovering with the team, he can finally join Law's crew now</br></br>  <br>I wouldnt miss stream or panda so whats your point?<br><br>12 year olds all day</br></br></br>  <br> Yes, because Oda wrote himself into a corner. <br>Explaining everything within 10 pages and opening a whole new door of possibilities for Sabo is writing himself into a corner.<br><br>Got it, nerd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bounty flyers have the names on them.<br>Also Luffy is Dragon's son, i'm pretty sure he or another one of his crew would mention that name to a high rank officer like Sabo at least once in 10 years.<br>And Ace' name and face was literally all over the entire world before the war.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean it's okay to post them. Just because you wore bell bottoms when you were young doesn't mean it's okay to wear them now.<br>Just fuck off, 4chan clearly isn't for you if I have to explain this.</br></br>  <br> You said Oda didn't foreshadow Sabo period. <br>I don't know who you are even talking to, but I have not noticed anyone claim that. <br><br> amnesia is literally the only thing that could justify Sabo yet you hate it because it explains everything? <br>That is exactly the fucking point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't miss your chapter being translated and ready for you to read on tuesday ?</br>  <br><br>Nobody knew Luffy was Dragon's son before the war.</br></br>  <br>It wouldn't have made any sense, because he shouldn't even exist.</br>  <br>He already did it when he turned from Cutty Flam into Franky.</br>  <br>If names and pictures with no context were enough to solve amnesia it wouldn't be a problem.<br><br>The difference was that Ace died, it's what triggered his memory.</br></br></br>  <br> That is exactly the fucking point. <br>I don't understand. Should One Piece not make sense?</br></br>  <br>What a convenient amnesia.</br>  <br> You don't have any reason to discredit Oda besides disliking the character. <br>No one is discrediting Oda, you fucking fanboy. <br>I and some other anons just give examples of shit writing. <br>Oda is writing the most famous and best-selling manga of the last decade. He's under immense pressure, of course he makes mistakes.<br>But everyone has the right to mention these mistakes and call him out on it.<br><br>Serious question to end this discussion: Do you think Oda is infallible? Yes or no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the guy Doflamingo despised joining the crew of the guy Doflamingo worshipped <br>There's something wrong about this.</br></br>  <br>Nope. I actually have other things to do than read mango.</br>  <br> i'm pretty sure he or another one of his crew would mention that name to a high rank officer like Sabo at least once in 10 years. <br>It was shown literally this chapter that the revolutionaries didn't know Luffy was Dragon's son until it was revealed at Marineford, did you even read the chapter?</br></br>  <br>That's right, taking him 9 years until seeing the news of Ace's death made it so convenient. It must be great having amnesia.</br>  <br>It should, but being forced into a situation where you have to write up a convenient amnesia for it to make sense is shit. Just plan ahead and stop adding shit to your already overly long saga halfway through and we wouldn't be in this mess.</br>  <br>Not even a Zorofag but that smile is adorable.</br>  <br>Why? Law can be the new pride of the North Blue which is why Bellamy joined originally, also he wants to survive the 'great wave' mentioned in pic related.</br>  <br>Just like people have a right to mention mistakes, other people also have a right to disagree that they are mistakes.</br>  <br>Then why aren't you doing them right now ?</br>  <br> But everyone has the right to mention these mistakes and call him out on it. <br>Show me how Sabo as a whole was a mistake.<br>Because I don't see it.<br>All this shit in this thread boils down to one person's flawed assumption that Sabo wasn't foreshadowed, then moving the goalposts and saying Sabo wasn't foreshadowed since East fucking Blue.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am.</br>  <br> still responding to retarded turbofaggots </br>  Oda could introduce a 4th brother and you faggots would eat it up.   kyros has 2 legs again   <br>You can't fucking disagree with facts, that is what makes you a shiteating fanboy.</br>  <br>What you're saying makes no fucking sense. He wasn't forced into doing anything, he came up with the idea for having a third brother who was missing and amnesiac and then added it. You're acting as though he came up with Sabo and then years later scrambled to come up with an excuse as to why he wasn't there.</br>  <br><br> he can't multi-task </br></br>  <br>Well... where exactly do you draw the line? Don't tell me you're one of those people who think haki wasn't planned.</br>  <br>Again, how is being convenient mean bad?<br>It makes sense.<br> Just plan ahead <br>He planned 25 chapters ahead<br> stop adding shit to your already overly long saga halfway through <br>I'll judge the whole saga after I reread the whole thing in one go.<br>I'd like to believe I'm a chill fuck like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you're not, you're wasting your time arguing with me.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> unironically claiming your own opinion is fact <br>This is why no one is taking your criticism seriously.</br></br>  <br>I prefer sister.</br>  <br>Honestly didn't notice.</br>  <br>Kids nowadays have the attention span of a gold fish. Its literally impossible.</br>  Well at least we got a look at the kind of person Dragon is.<br> Is it true he's your son? <br> Huh? Oh yeah. </br></br>  <br>We wouldn't, seeing as the cups on the trunk were set on 3 even during the flashbacks full of only Ace and Luffy.<br> but what if he was late to the drinking <br>It wouldn't work seeing as he doesn't have any way to get included in the flashback.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good thing I'm not a kid then.</br></br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br>  <br>Yeah...your mum</br>  <br>delete this</br>  <br><br> keep telling yourself that <br><br>I will as I do it all right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one is saying he wasn't foreshadowed.<br>But he got introduced into the story as a last minute reason.<br>He's such an important character to Luffy's entire personality, history and one of the reasons why Luffy is who he is today.<br>Luffy's father was introduced in Louge Town, Ace was introduced in Alabasta, but Oda waited 6 years after that to introduce another "family" member (pretty sure we will never see Luffy's mother alive).<br>The entire 3rd brother story makes absolutely no sense. At least at Alabasta, when Luffy introduced ace as his brother, don't you think it would be a good time to mention Sabo? Or at least foreshadow him then.</br></br></br></br></br>  I like how they're all relaxed and don't give a shit about Sanji    <br>Who?</br>  <br> Haki was planned <br> This is was fanboys actually believe <br>Ok, so you're saying Haki was planned?<br>Then why did Shanks, one of the most powerful Haki users in the entire OP universe, lose his arm to a baby Sea King, that Luffy could one shot at the start of the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop criticizing Oda you shiteater!</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br><br> why did Shanks, one of the most powerful Haki users in the entire OP universe, lose his arm to a baby Sea King, that Luffy could one shot at the start of the manga. <br>Same reason he got a beer thrown in his face instead of obliterating the guy who threw it.</br></br></br></br></br>  AHAHAHAHAHA<br><br> Rebecca is not here <br> Bartolomeo is not here <br> BELLAMY IS HERE <br><br>NAKAMA CONFIRMED. Kyros is here because it's his house and Law is here because of the alliance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No one is saying he wasn't foreshadowed. <br>Missed the few posts up there anon?<br> But he got introduced into the story as a last minute reason. <br>25 chapters before the war is last minute? CP0 is last minute not Sabo.<br> Or at least foreshadow him then. <br>He was dead to them. There's no point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br> Then why did Shanks, one of the most powerful Haki users in the entire OP universe, lose his arm to a baby Sea King, that Luffy could one shot at the start of the manga? <br><br>Powerlevel fags in a nutshell</br></br></br>  <br> actually caring enough about what I think that he'd show me what he's doing <br>This is golden.<br>I too can open audacity, make a screenshot and pretend I'm doing shit though.</br></br></br>  <br> Same reason he got a beer thrown in his face instead of obliterating the guy who threw it. <br>That's probably the most retarded answer i ever got to my question.</br></br>  <br>Another double watermark. Jesus fuck, how do you people read your manga? What the fuck is wrong with you?</br>  <br>How is it retarded?</br>  <br> THIS IS ACE, MY BROTHER WHO'S STILL ALIVE <br> Wait, what? <br> Nothing, don't worry about it, you'll find out in 6 years <br>Yeah that would have been so much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> why didn't Luffy, a character who never volunteers anything about his past even to his closest friends and who never dwells on anything personal unless it's immediately relevant, tell us all about his backstory immediately <br>lol okay</br></br>  <br>Why did Shanks get his shit pushed in at the bar?<br>Why did Luffy's dumb ass emulate him years after?<br><br>It was to make a point. Stop being a shiteater.</br></br></br></br>  What is Sanji doing?  <br>Flock of birds logia.</br>  <br>interns fucking up</br>  <br> Then why did Shanks, one of the most powerful Haki users in the entire OP universe, lose his arm to a baby Sea King, that Luffy could one shot at the start of the manga? <br>This is a retarded argument, because even without Haki Shanks still should have been able to easily beat the seaking, so it really has no bearing at all on the Haki argument. The real answer is that Shanks decided to sacrifice his arm to push Luffy towards whatever he thinks he can become.</br></br>  <br>What reason would he have to obliterate someone that threw beer on his face? How is that related to him losing his arm because he doesn't bother defending himself against a monster?</br>  <br>Why does everyone forget about Ace's tattoo? Also Ace was shown in Drum Kingdom first.</br>  <br>That would actually be quite cool. Reminds me of that genjutsu of Itachi.</br>  <br> Why did Shanks get his shit pushed in at the bar? <br>He didn't want to start shit with the bandits. He also didn't care, because he was WAY out of there league. That was LITERALLY stated in that chapter.<br> It was to make a point <br>What point? If you have the abilities to easily put down a Seaking or harden your Body with Haki to save your limbs, don't do it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he did defend himself.<br>That's why it ran away.</br></br>  <br>fgo ahead</br>  <br>Only the severely injured are there, its days later. You're only gonna disappoint yourself if you read too much into it.</br>  <br>Stop making excuses for Oda.</br>  <br><br>I have to wonder how much of an ulterior motive Shanks has with Luffy and if he's really as nice as he seems. Obviously I'm not expecting some dumb Aizen shit but he is a Yonkou so he's clearly not a very good or friendly person to most people and losing his arm was very clearly deliberate.</br></br>  One more nothing happens:the chapter<br><br>4th chapter in a row, congratulations oda!</br></br>  <br>Right!</br>  <br> was never mentioned <br>It wouldn't be bad if he would die.</br></br>  <br>After losing an arm to one of the weakest characters introduced in the entire manga.</br>  <br> What point? <br>To make Luffy realize that pirating and the sea was dangerous as fuck especially to one as hardheaded as Luffy.<br><br>To make my case, Luffy only started thinking a little bit after Ace died, like hiding behind Shirahoshi's back or trying to keep the Lucy identity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For girls only ?</br>  <br>  lose his arm to a baby Sea King <br>Oda editor wants him more cooler.</br></br>  <br> sleepover with the hottest guys of Dressrosa <br> nothing happens <br>Look at him, look at him and laugh</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I really doubt something like that would happen. I think Shanks is just similar to Whitebeard, they gave up on their own ambitions of becoming the pirate king and found a new generation who they thought was worthy, and did what they thought was best to push them further towards their goals. Shanks pulling a keikaku would definitely be a surprising twist, but only because of how dumb it would be.</br>  <br>And Robin still won't get wet because Franky's injured.<br><br>That woman is sick.</br></br></br>  <br> Shanks' convo with Whitebeard <br> I bet this arm on the future <br>What's so hard to believe about someone betting on a brighter future?<br>It's what parents do and Shanks is like a dad to Luffy</br></br></br></br>  <br>And also a fucking liar.<br>He said after Hairudin defeated Machvise and collapsed, that by the tim he wakes up the Birdcage won't be there and gave a badass look.<br>Few chapters later he did nothing but tried to push that fucking cage while on the other panel we saw Hajruidin pushing it too.<br>Why did he lie for the giant?<br>That stupid faggot!</br></br></br></br></br>   hurr if haki was planned why did Shanks lose an arm <br>Shanks is a lazy motherfucker, in case you didn't notice. If he wanted to, that beer from the random bar pirate dickhead wouldn't have even hit him in the first place. Likewise, when Shanks saved Luffy, Shanks was SO focused on Luffy that he took up all his attention and Shanks didn't even bother to protect his arm. On top of that, Shanks probably only needs 1 arm in order to be strong. Shanks only bothered using haki after he was sure Luffy was safe. Luffy was his priority.<br><br>So after all that, you can see that Shanks losing his arm says NOTHING about haki being unplanned. Haki was planned. The proof is Shanks scaring away the sea king.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that would mean Oda planned Haki and we all know whoever believes that is a cocksucking faggot!</br>  <br>and don't forget, no chapter next week<br><br>BRAVODA<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O<br>D<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WB didn't so much give up his ambitions as he never had them in the first place. And honestly I think Shanks could very well be the same. All we've seen him doing thus far is camp on various island and party all night with his crew. I don't think he wishes for anything else.</br>  <br> Haki was planned <br>Then why wasn't it called haki and explained in detail like nen or chakra?<br>Checkmate, atheist!</br></br></br>  <br> To make Luffy realize that pirating and the sea was dangerous as fuck especially to one as hardheaded as Luffy. <br>Luffy was literally seconds before his death. It would be have been the same effect if Shanks saved him without losing an arm.<br><br>Stop with these retarded excuses. A man who can instantly stop the biggest war in the history should not lose his arm to a weak as fuck baby seaking.<br><br>Here's the reason for that: Oda couldn't even imagine how successful and for how long OP would run. <br>He didn't have the idea of Shanks being one of the strongest and he didn't have thought about Haki back then.<br>That's all. That isn't even Oda's fault, but desperately defending Shanks losing his arm is beyond retarded and shows how fucking obnoxious and cancerous fanboys are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess it's just pretty extreme is all. Although this is One Piece so characters doing crazy shit is standard.</br></br>  <br>He said after losing to Mihawk that he would never lose again.<br>Why did he lie for the captain?<br>That stupid faggot!</br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you're quoting but.<br>Honestly, Oda has yet to write anything that I don't like. I'm not going to claim I have high standards, but I don't think Oda could write something I didn't like. Oda is of course infallible because people simply are, but I don't think he's capable of disappointing me. It's probably simply me being a fanboy but I'm okay with that.</br></br>  <br>Could be a replacement, Law and Franky are there, either take one from a dead guy or make a robotic one, or the dwarf might have healed it.</br>  <br>Stop baiting, you know he was talking aout Luffy.<br>You just hoped he would take matters into his own hands when you first read that and you were predictably disapointed.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's definitely possible. Either way by the time they met Ace/Luffy they cared more about helping them become pirate king than any of their own ambitions.</br>  <br>So where's the proof Shanks as he was back then could have stopped the Marineford war?</br>  <br>Here, retard, this page should give you a good idea of Shanks' personality. He is a lazy motherfucker. Give me one good reason, any at all, of how some random nobody pirate can trick a fucking emperor at close range like this. Go ahead. Give me one. Because going by what we know about emperors, even if Shanks was alone, what this random pirate should not be possible.<br><br>Yes it is. Shanks SHOULD have killed this guy before he could even blink, but he let him throw Luffy into the sea.</br></br></br>  <br> when Shanks saved Luffy, Shanks was SO focused on Luffy that he took up all his attention and Shanks didn't even bother to protect his arm <br>he didn't even need to, he could have taken out that Seaking with Haoshoku.<br> Shanks probably only needs 1 arm in order to be strong.  <br>Great argument. He should have cut it off himself then, to be lighter and faster.<br> Haki was planned. The proof is Shanks scaring away the sea king. <br>No, it was just showing how fucking intimidating Shanks is.<br>You are so far up in Oda's ass, it's not even funny anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole haki argument is stupid because only Oda knows when he came up with what. The truth is most likely a mix of both, that he had the idea for haki but hadn't fully decided if he wanted to include it or not so he added haki moments without actually introducing it. That way he could either introduce it later or they could just be brushed away as fighting spirit moments.</br>  <br>Because East Blue hadn't heard of it and treated DFs like a myth. <br>Then Paradise had DFs everywhere but Haki wasn't.<br><br><br>You don't think Shanks betting his arm on a new era was a sufficient explanation?<br>I guess he was just bullshitting Whitebeard and every reader then.<br> defending Shanks losing his arm is beyond retarded and shows how fucking obnoxious and cancerous fanboys are <br>Oh come on, not everyone thinks in power levels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe... maybe Oda didn't think the manga would become a powerlevel fest back in fucking 1997, so normal world things like deceiving a dude were accepted even if characters were stronger than others<br><br>What you (and thousands of people who argue about all anime and manga on the internet daily) need to do is stop looking at it as if you were a character inside the world, but start interpreting the FICTION fed to you by the AUTHOR, because that's how these things work. They are not real.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, Kinjishi and Kyros cut off their own feet. Zoro gave it a try to escape Mr. 3's trap.<br>You can argue losing an arm is worse than a leg though.<br>If Shanks complained about losing the arm or tried to guilt Luffy with it then I'd be worried but he's shown no regrets. He even gave Luffy Roger's hat, passing the torch.</br></br></br>  <br> implying anything ever happens when 2 men or more are in the same room with one woman <br>She's knows nothing will happen.</br></br>  <br>As you can see here, the sea king was literally chomping down when Shanks arrived. Shanks had to save Luffy at the same time so he probably couldn't concentrate properly enough to scare away the sea king, not while Luffy was drowning anyway.</br>  <br>I always took Luffy's absolutely ape shit rage punch on the tennryubuto as foreshadowing to Sabo's death. He knew these people were the reason Sabo was dead.</br>  <br>When did he lose since then?</br>  <br> Here's the reason for that: Oda couldn't even imagine how successful and for how long OP would run. <br> He didn't have the idea of Shanks being one of the strongest <br>This is one of the dumbest arguments that people post all the time. Power creep does not explain it at all, because Shanks was always supposed to be much, much stronger than a seaking. Luffy defeated one in the same exact chapter, at the very start of his journey. If you think Oda wanted Luffy to already have surpassed Shanks at that point then you're retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Whether haki was planned or not, nen certainly fucking wasn't.</br>  <br>Is this a troll? Even before I knew about nen, when I first saw Netero V Gon + Killua, I could tell he had some hidden energy boost thing.</br>  <br>It's sufficient in the sense that there was nothing better for Oda to excuse it after the fact. It's still a shitty excuse he had to make for the event to make sense.</br>  <br>Theres been a few times Zoro has "lost" but its a moot point because he swore to never lose against another swordsman, not never lose in general.</br>  <br>I was being tongue in cheek to the first post, but Zoro's lost plenty of times since then<br>Kuma, Kizaru, Aokiji, Enel, Lucci the first time, probably some more that I'm forgetting<br>I don't care because it's unrealistic to think he could keep the promise and I'd rather it be broken in extreme situations than Oda be forced to keep the promise</br></br></br>  <br>here<br>I just wanted to add the reply I already gave you in the saging thread</br></br>  <br>The thing is, over the years Oda has raised the bar so high that putting Shanks at the very top gives him near-superhuman qualities if we want to think he's a fighter on par with WB and other stuff we've seen by now. That calibre of dude shouldn't just fuck up against a Seaking like that, especially because as you well said Seakings were always supposed to be weak fish.<br><br>That's where the incongruence comes from.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo would have been a better character if we found out he choose his duty and revolutionary ideals over brotherhood instead of this amnesia crap so he ends up not having to make such a difficult decision.</br>  <br> Let's split up and find them. <br>With CoO they shouldn't split up, Shanks should find Luffy by sensing him in an eyeblink.</br></br>  <br> maybe Oda didn't think the manga would become a powerlevel fest <br> power level fest <br>please just fuck off and kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's because Shank's move was deliberate. He clearly doesn't care about losing his arm and he even said to WB he bet it on the new age.</br></br>  <br>Why would you need to scare the sea king.<br><br>Just haki up your arm so the sea king's teeth would break if it tried biting your arm.</br></br></br>  This was a very interesting asspull chapter form oda, to make a bullshit excuse for not putting sabo in the marineford war. I have to agree amnesia is a great asspull excuse! Stay classe one piece<br><br> odafags will defend this </br></br>  <br>The water would have been  the tears of doffyfags. </br>  <br> Lucci the first time <br>He and Luffy lost just because they didn't give a fuck and doesn't want to fight until Robin asking them for that.</br></br>  <br>You're assuming Shanks is a completely calm, in control individual all the time. He's not. See: <br><br><br>If anything, you can argue that Oda making Shanks an emperor is an asspull because the fact that some nobody managed to get away from a fucking emperor is in itself ridiculous. But don't blame the haki here, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>An excuse is a justification for when something doesn't make sense.<br>If it makes sense, it's not an excuse.</br></br>  IÂ´m glad sabo fucked off.  What's the point of Sabo handing his card when Robin already knows where Revolutionary HQ is.<br><br>It's not like Sabo will be away from Dragon that much.</br></br>  <br>nice shitpost<br>see you in 2 weeks</br></br>  Are CP9 technics a lover level of haki?  <br>Sure. That's retarded as hell. He 'bet' it because he gave his arm in return for saving Luffy as that was the only way (in 1997 One Piece power levels), not because he deliberately fed it to the fucking fish in some sort of display (what?).</br>  Bellamy nakama confirmed  I want powerlevelfags to fuck off  It's not his, it's Luffy's card, that's why he gave the biggest piece of paper to Zoro.  <br>You're missing my point. I agree with everything you said, but thats exactly why that argument doesn't fit. Even if he didn't plan on Shanks being one of the strongest people in the world, he clearly intended on him being strong and a major character. There's no way that Luffy just setting out on his journey would already be stronger than Shanks was 10 years ago, even without taking power creep into consideration. Even if One Piece only went for 50 chapters, it still would have been a strong character losing an arm to a fish much weaker than him. Oda intended from the very first chapter for that to be an unnecessary sacrifice on Shanks' part.</br>  <br>yes bby</br>  <br>Meant for </br>  I remember retards saying as soon as the birdcage disappeared we'd receive a call from their den-den mushi. Where are all these retards now? I need a new retard theory to laugh at.  <br>How would that be better? <br> Hey Luffy and Ace had a third brother but he's an asshole who doesn't care whether either of them die </br></br>  Wonder what's the shitty excuse going to be for Fujitora to waste the entire afternoon plus night by not doing anything to the pirates much less locking down the harbor to prevent escape.<br><br>I would not be surprised if Akainu sent Kizaru to Dressrosa right now because of this since Fujitora is clearly lagging on purpose.</br></br>  <br>Maybe Shanks was just a weakass then. It was 10 years before Luffy left to start pirating. 10 years is enough time to rise up and become an emperor, look how much Luffy accomplished in 3 years.<br>Oh wait, he used to duel with Mihawk when he had two arms. Shit. Uh, maybe Mihawk was weak too?<br><br><br> That's because Shank's move was deliberate <br>I'd argue that. To me it seems he was too focused on saving Luffy to worry about his arm<br> He clearly doesn't care about losing his arm <br>This I agree with. Like how Luffy didn't care about not getting a boat if Hancock unstoned Margaret and co.<br>Stuff like that isn't worth sweating, a lesson Luffy took to heart when he saw Shanks get beat by the bandits</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A strong human losing an arm in an extreme situation makes sense. A literal superman who can make his arm out of iron, knock out hordes of people by looking at them and also posseses mind-reading powers in a world where dudes just clap and suddenly giant earthquakes that destroy islands come up; well, THAT dude losing his arm to fodder fish is another story.<br><br>It's a matter of how OP was comparatively more down to earth at the beginning and how much more over the top it has gotten over the years.</br></br></br>  <br>Him willingly losing an arm for something as vague as betting it on a new age does not make sense. It would have made more sense if the situation was such that he had to lose the arm to protect Luffy or himself.<br><br>Either way, there was some for of asspullery. It's either Shanks turning out to be as strong as he is like  suggested, or haki.</br></br></br>  <br>He made a vivre card of Luffy, and then took a small piece for himself which is why he gave Zoro the big sheet. It's so that they can find him, not so he can find them. Also, don't forget that vivre cards do more than just give you directions, you can also tell someones health and whether they are still alive or not.</br>  I wonder how many people here that keeps saying Sabo was a sudden asspull that came out of nowhere realize that ALL of Luffy's family suddenly came out of nowhere. <br> ace post alabasta <br> dragon in logue town <br> Gawp post buster call <br>Point is Luffy doesn't talk about his family at all unless explicitly asked about it, which is part of his character. Call it a convenient personality plot if you like, but that's how Luffy has always been written.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I still find this scene to be retarded.<br><br>Shanks was already getting his name out in RogerÂ´s crew, even the white stache remembered him back then, and he donÂ´t remember mooks.<br><br>So why the hell did he let his arm get munched by an east blue tier sea monster?<br><br>Purely dramatic impact.<br><br>If he had CoC back then, he would be really good with the other haki as well.<br><br>Hell, he could've even punched the fucker to another Blue.<br><br>Luffy was able to ohko him right when starting out his adventure, it was nothing but a setup for revenge.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It should be a full moon tonight...<br><br>Or is Jinbe that much further into the future?</br></br>  <br> It's a matter of how OP was comparatively more down to earth at the beginning and how much more over the top it has gotten over the years. <br>That might be a decent argument if it were not for the fact that brand new pirate Luffy easily one shot a seaking with no effort whatsoever. Even if Shanks were merely a strong but not super human guy, he should have been able to save him without sacrificing his arm.</br></br>  <br> Maybe Shanks was just a weakass then <br>Of course, it makes sense. But then how do you explain his supposed haki that he used to scare away the fish? You got to be at least a moderate-to-high level of hax to start using that sort of stuff semi consciously, as shown by Luffy.</br></br>  <br><br>Was he even classed as a Yonkou back then?</br></br>  <br>Every one of Zoro's losses has an explanation/handicap. But he still lost.<br>He lost to Arlong since he was still recovering from Mihawk's slash.<br>Doffy lost to Luffy because of Law's Gamma Knife.<br>Moria lost because Luffy had nightmare Luffy</br></br></br></br>  <br> Him willingly losing an arm for something as vague as betting it on a new age does not make sense. <br>What?<br><br>I guess gamblers, investors, sports teams owners don't exist nowadays since leaving things up to chance doesn't make sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kid Shanks was already strong enough to fight with adult members of Whitebeard's crew.<br><br>Whitebeard remembered both Kid Shanks and Kid Buggy being able to fight against his crew even though they were both still kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw luffy's mom is introduced and everyone on /a/ screams asspull. </br>  <br>So let me get this straight...<br>You say:<br> if haki existed back then, why didn't Shanks use it to protect his arm and immediately locate Luffy? <br>YET YOU COMPLETELY IGNORE THE BETTER QUESTION OF<br> if Shanks is an emperor or nearing emperor strength AND had his entire crew behind him, why did he let some mook even breathe while stepping on Luffy, let alone run away to his ship? <br>Yeah, nah, get out.<br><br><br>Even if he wasn't, he used to spar with Mihawk so his strength was at least really fucking good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well maybe he should have thought of it before deciding to add Sabo in 500 chapters into the story and being faced with this dilemma.</br>  <br><br>That's bullshit, but i believe it.</br></br>  <br><br>Why doesn't it make sense? Along with giving him the straw hat that move is what affected Luffy the most.</br></br>  <br><br>Because Haruma used his: imma use a smokebomb and teleport the fuck away no jutsu</br></br>  <br><br> Oh wait, he used to duel with Mihawk when he had two arms. Shit. <br>That was kind of my point guys. I refuted my own suggestion in the same post</br></br></br>  <br>Kyros lives in Hueco Mundo.<br>But more seriously, we do know there are more than one satellite going around OP's world. The moon visible from Dressrosa might not be the same one Jinbei's looking at.</br></br>  If Haki existed as back as chapter 1, then it would only make sense for Shanks to display it. Of course it wasn't developed at all, and you can't blame Oda, he's been writing for almost 20 years. He probably liked the concept of a 'strong spirit' or whatever Bushido shit he thought was cool and made Shanks scare away the fish with a look, but he sure as hell wasn't thinking about which way he wanted to draw the CoA-imbued fists that nullified DF powers.  <br>What? Are you responding to the right post? Because what you said doesn't make any sense. You said "Sabo would be better if he chose duty over the brothers instead of just forgetting about them". Which is an entirely separate thing from whether Sabo should have been introduced at all.</br>  This chapter is bullshit. The Revolution Army already had the Straw Hat's wanted posters from the very beginning. Sabo should remember Luffy's face and name just like he did when he saw Ace in the newspaper. Plus I bet they had Ace's wanted poster too, years before. His memories about his brothers should have return far earlier.  <br>Entirely possible but we don't know if that's been confirmed. The Ohara model could mean anything.<br><br>The only moon that's really been mentioned before is Fairy Vearth.<br><br>That and throughout the pre-timeskip story, the moon phases are fairly consistent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So luffy will figure out after the vivre card is set on fire that sabo's lifespan is slowly diminishing.<br>Sabo will be executed in a week but not before the revolutionary army arrives to draw out a war with marineford to take him back.</br></br></br>  <br> Him willingly losing an arm for something <br>Having no regrets =/= willingly losing<br>You don't make a bet to lose. If you do lose you can regret it or you can move on with no regrets.<br> It would have made more sense if the situation was such that he had to lose the arm to protect Luffy or himself. <br>That was the situation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Amnesia must be the easiest thing to cure if all it took was a picture and a name to bring memories back.</br>  <br>See<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Well even in real life one of the ways to bring back amnesia is a mental shock.</br>  <br>Sometimes, yeah.</br>  <br>In the end that's exactly what happened though, the only difference is the context changed from "Pirate did bad things" to "Pirate died".</br>  <br>plot that make sense.</br>  <br>And a shitload of info to go along with it too.</br>  <br><br>If it is significant enough, yes - same thing happens in real life.</br></br>  <br>"making sense" is not a virtue if literally everything else about it screams lame.</br>  <br> ACE DIED <br> pic of ace's back holed in <br>is more of a believable mental shock than<br> WANTED PORTGAS D ACE <br> smiling pussy magnet </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm waiting on the raws to confirm this but what I'm thinking is his reading up on Ace and Luffy's relationship was what triggered it, not just the photos.</br></br>  <br> WANTED PORTGAS D ACE smiling pussy magnet </br>  <br>What no way Luffy has a mom!! He was born out of a peach !!</br>   reminder that Sabo's telling the story to Zoro who was actually not far away when it actually happened   <br>but the person in the picture has to be dead by magma fist first.</br>  <br>What info did he receive at that moment that he didn't already have, other than Ace being killed?</br>  <br>Nice catch anon. Now the story came full circle.</br>  Isn't a vivre card made from someone's finger nail?  <br>I remember as much. <br>It probably wouldn't be very hard for Sabo to ask Luffy for a finger nail, give it to Koala, who brought it to a competent guy from the revolutionary army/Dressrosa.</br></br>  <br> "making sense" is not a virtue <br>yes it is</br></br>  <br>and hair</br>  <br><br>exactly the same shit</br></br>  <br>Luffy died in Marineford. Akainu had him at 1m when he killed Ace, so he reflexively destroyed Luffy with another Magma fist.<br><br>That makes sense, yet it would be retarded.</br></br></br>   people trying to justify Shanks losing an arm <br>It doesn't make sense in the slightest, stop even trying, it was all the way back in 97, there's no way Oda could have foreseen the details of the story story and development of power levels that far ahead.</br>  <br>Those are shadows anon!</br>  <br>How the hell is making sense a virtue in a piece of fiction unless you're absolutely autistic?</br>  <br> power levels <br>and this is the problem of you fucking faggots</br></br>  <br>You're missing the point, really hard. Shanks losing an arm makes no sense, but no because of the development of power levels. Its just something that Oda had happen even though it made no sense because he thought it was cool. It has nothing to do with power levels or time or haki, he just thought it was cool for a strong guy to sacrifice his arm to inspire the MC.</br>  <br><br>Oda is actually one of the few who can plan far into the future</br></br>  <br>are you literally fucking retarded?</br>  <br> Kizaru <br><br>what if he sends  Ryokugyu </br></br></br>  <br> powerlevel isn't a thing that exists <br>I don't see why you're so riled up about it<br><br><br>That's exactly what I was trying to say though, people looking into powerlevels to argue about this are missing the point that it was the first fucking chapter and he needed some dramatic event to capture the reader's attention.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he could plan far into the future we wouldn't have had Sabo rely on an amnesia cop-out.</br>  <br><br>Why? It happened like 10 years before Luffy went out to sea. Shanks could just have easily been not that strong back then. Hell, look how far everyone else has come in 2 years, let alone 10.</br></br>  <br>there areno powerlevels in One Piece and that is just a fucking fact</br>   at least half the chapter is panels we've already seen <br><br>Thanks oda, after all these flashbacks i really needed another one.</br></br>   people thinking sabo added as a last minute asspull <br> people don't remember the asxe tattoo of ace <br><br>It's planned from the beginning like many of the characters of One piece.</br></br></br>  <br><br>wut</br></br>  <br>Nope, clearly that was just supposed to show that Ace is too retarded to spell his own name right.</br>  <br>right!</br>  <br>It's chapter release period what do you expect other than speedreaders, shitposters and newfags?</br>  <br><br>If he didn't he'd probably try to interfere.<br><br>But sabo a shit anyways</br></br></br></br>  <br>He means that Ace had an ASCE tatoo on his arm with a crossed out S. The crossed out S was obviously an hommage to Sabo. So Sabo was planned ever since Ace first appeared, at the very least.</br>  <br> literally not even 2 pages <br> half the chapter <br>autism</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see the L stating Luffy is still alive.</br>  Luffy and his crew will reach one piece by making rebecca cry a skyward waterway to float over all their potential problems to get to raftel  <br>If this is not planned there are a few explanations, like the different satellites that exist around that planet, or simply the stages of the moon dont work like they do for us.</br>  <br>The only way to not have it be amnesia would be to make him an asshole who doesn't care about his brothers, which ruins the point of even adding a third brother.</br>  What does Sabo mean by "These few days have been messy for Dressrosa" when barely a day has passed by on Dressrosa?<br><br>Unless Sabo is implying Fujitora didn't do anything to the pirates for two to three days already.</br></br>  <br>Don't be fucking stupid. It was to show off how much of a good and lovable idiot Ace was. I think the first time we see it was when Ace had fallen asleep with his face on the plate, right? <br>That was just to reinforce the image of Ace being a stupid good that even typed his name wrong in a tattoo and had to cross one of the letters out.<br><br>Oda took advantage of it later as he introduced Sabo and had it signify him instead, but you are being silly if you are actually claiming that Sabo was foreshadowed back in Alabasta.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop trying, you'll never reach Rebeccafag's level with such obvious baiting.</br>  <br><br>Are you goddamn blind?<br><br>Fuck yes half the chapter is flashbacks.<br><br>It's showing shit that you would figure out just now only if you've been living on half a rotting braincell all this time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you're only pretending to be that retarded.</br>  <br>Because Luffy isn't thought to be dead, in memoriam y'know. Ace probably didn't need to add his initials.</br>   NO OP NEXT WEEK <br><br>EVERY <br>FUCKING<br>TIME</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, have him be busy with some other conflict or some shit. Dragon didn't interfere with the fight either, and he is supposed to be Luffys father.</br>  nuff said  <br> We revolutionaries need to take advantage of the Marines being focused in this area, we all have to make sacrifices Sabo <br>Took me less than a minute to come up with that.</br></br>  <br><br>I love One Piece but this is certainly true. Sabo should have stayed dead imo.<br><br>Or Oda could have introduced Sabo earlier but it's an asspull so yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off, you said "half of the chapter is panels we have already seen", now kill yourself you fucking autist</br>  <br>Do you even read the Manga faggot?<br>Narcolepsy ever heard of it?</br></br>  <br> It was to show off how much of a good and lovable idiot Ace was <br><br>What? Ace has always shown as a smart guy who's aware of his conditions. If the tattoo bearer would be Luffy you might be right, but no.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> I'm going to cross out the initial of my dead brother, but not include the initial of my alive brother <br>Stop being retarded, it was clearly done by someone who didn't know how to spell Ace.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Every fucking 4th time you mean</br></br>  <br>You're intentionally being obtuse, anon. When did Ace ever show himself to be nearly stupid enough to misspell his own name? It was always going to be an homage to someone from Ace's past that he cared about.</br>  <br>Why the fuck is he still using a poll anyway?</br>   luffy gets the bed while Law is sleeping on the ground <br>Had the heart pirates been there, this wouldn't be happening.</br>  <br>Dragon is Luffy's father not Ace, he didn't give a shit for Ace execution.</br>  <br>Why would he reference Luffy in a tattoo when he was still alive? And even if he wanted a luffy tatto, adding an L would make no sense because it would completely ruin the fact that its supposed to be his name, he would just have a different tattoo somewhere. Stop pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>Ace was a dork (with badass moments) back in Alabasta, you know, like Luffy. Oda only turned him into yaoibait later.</br>  <br>That makes no sense. Why write Asce and cross out the S because of Sabo being dead? Asce doesn't mean anything. Why would he put the S there? Misspelling of Ace is the only thing that makes sense.</br>  <br>Can't believe the Revolutionaries didn't take advantages] of the Marineford war when all the Admirals and the Marines were too busy with the war to protect any Celestial Dragons much less the Gorosei.<br><br>Just goes to show that Oda is a bad writer if he made Dragon this much of a retard to pass up an opportunity when all the marine powerhouses that are suppose to protect the Gorosei or the Celestial Dragons are too busy with Whitebeard.</br></br></br>  <br>Flashbacks are not the same thing as "panels we've already seen". All of the stuff with Sabo being injured and regaining his memories were new panels that happened to take place in the past.</br>  <br> Why would he reference Luffy in a tattoo when he was still alive? <br>He's his brother.<br>Why would he reference Sabo in a tattoo?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was complaining about the FLASHBACKS.<br><br>And it's showing shit that EVERYONE already knows.<br><br>This would be more important if those flashbacks haven't had any followups, but it sure did.<br><br>The only thing this chapter did was showing us sabo had amnesia, and then fucking off on his murder of crows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> badass shirtless hunk <br> not yaoibait since his debut <br>You're being delusional friend.</br></br></br>  <br>And its just as shitty as having him not care at all. If Sabo felt anywhere near as strong about Ace as Luffy and Ace did for each other then he would have gone even if he needed to quit the revolutionaries and go by himself.</br>  <br>It was on his arm, that'd be pretty awkward to do himself, I doubt many pirates have had formal education.</br>  <br> having someone else give you a tattoo of your name and you can't even be bothered to tell them what 3 letters they are. <br>Retarded as fuck.<br><br><br>Okay now you're definitely trolling.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> once in a lifetime opportunity <br> the strongest man in the world's there to break him out </br></br>  <br>Pirate symbol? Its a pirate manga after all you retard! <br>Read the Manga</br></br>  <br>this chapter filled blanks that were left earlier in the story so no</br>  <br> Why would he reference Sabo in a tattoo? <br>Because Sabo tragically died without ever getting a chance to fulfill their dream of being a pirate?</br></br>  <br>This is what they call a retcon. Next you will say that Dadan is planned as well</br>  Dragon confirmed for out of shits to give  <br>thank god you do not write one piece</br>  <br>And why would he stick the S there in the middle of his name? Stop being stupid.</br>  I used to defend One Piece's "questionable" parts when it was overall a really great manga, but it has been getting sloppy as shit lately and seeing these kids grasp at straws and come up with bullshit just to deny Oda could fuck up is sad. It's clear a lot of OP's fans can't discern good from bad, so they liked the manga when it was good and can't notice any difference when it turned bad. But I guess that shouldn't surprise me, it works like that for all pieces of media.  <br>They are trying to make countries free themselves, not go completely into an all out suicidal war dumb ass</br>  <br> having to tell them how to spell your name <br> instead of saying "hey write "Ace"" </br></br>  <br>Thats so stupid I can't even believe you would actually think that. If it wasn't supposed to be a reference to Sabo then why would Oda later change it to pretend it was? If he wanted the tattoo to show us that Ace was retarded then giving it a sentimental reason completely defeats the purpose.</br>  <br><br>Bellemy worshiped Doflamingo because he was the strongest pirate in North blue and followed him because he wanted to be just like him.<br>Now that luffy has defeated Doflamingo, proven he is stronger (in Bellamy's eyes don't give me that doffy was weakened bs) and showed compassion treating Bellamy like a friend more than doffy every did i can see an epiphany for Bellamy and luffy inviting him to join. he won't fit in but he'll learn</br></br></br>  <br>runs in the family</br>  <br> everyone who disagrees with me is a fanboy <br> its not me who is wrong its the wooooooooorld <br>sure buddy</br></br></br>  <br>You don't need a formal education to know how to spell the word Ace. You'd have to be braindead to spell it wrong and I doubt you'd let a braindead guy tattoo your arm without making sure his spelling is correct.</br>  <br>That retards like you think its a spell mistake!<br>Its to much for your little brain i guess, shitty 12 years olds all over this place ...</br></br>  <br>That doesn't explain why he'd get a tattoo of his name and think "Yeah, let's spell this wrong on purpose". You'd do something else to symbolize your brother.</br>  <br>It's a convenience.</br>  <br>That was my favorite page, second is when learning that Koala has a crow related df.</br>  <br>Nice backpedaling. They never intended to make countries free but under their banner.<br><br>Fujitora is the one telling Riku to be independent of everyone.<br><br>The revolutionaries on the other hand are only saying be independent of wg but they never said to be independent of the revolutionaries</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like, no waaaaaay</br>  <br><br>This</br></br>  <br>It's better than <br> lol I had amnesia until I saw his death in the newspaper despite the fact I've seen his name and face potentially hundreds of times before in the same fucking newspapers </br></br>  <br>Bellamy joining would make sense from an in-universe perspective, but it'll never happen because from a story perspective it would be stupid. His DF is too similar to Luffy's, and he wouldn't have a unique roll in the crew.</br>  <br> grasp at straws <br>BRAVO<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>ODA</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he could conveniently make use of it. The same way Rayleigh reused a design of a random pirate pictured in one of the early covers iirc, and was later reappropriated to be Rayleigh. <br>This doesn't signify Rayleigh as a character was planned and has his design locked in that early in the manga, it just means that Oda made use of an early design that fit. <br>Same way the tattoo was retconned to signify Sabo instead of being just a way to show Ace being a silly goof.</br></br></br>  <br>no, it actually isn't</br>  <br>I still like the manga but you just have to admit some parts are retarded.</br>  <br><br>Shanks was already strong when he met Luffy in East Blue. He was in Roger's crew ffs.<br><br>I remember in the earlier episodes when Luffy first gained a bounty, Mihawk spreaded the news into Shanks and they had a conversation like this.<br><br>Shanks: "Yo Mihawk, why did you come? I'm in a bad mood right now so I kinda don't want to talk."<br><br>Mihawk then showed Shanks the poster and Shanks was instantly put in a good mood. Mihawk declined though saying he is not interested to fight a man with a single arm. He also said something like this:<br><br>"Everyone was surprised, when a man of your caliber lost an arm in a weak sea(east blue)."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> death <br>and this is the crunchpoint</br></br>  Why are the chapters early this week?<br><br>Anw:<br><br>Kyros has 2 legs.<br>Some dude has control over crows and can talk through them<br>Koala a cute<br>Sabo chief of staff not 2nd in command. (Or they're the same I don't know)<br>Fuji did not capture Law and Luffy yet, Maybe it's cause he's blind and nobody is telling him where they are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't answer the question at all. You're explaining how he could change it, not why he would change it. If the original purpose was to show Ace as being stupid, why would he then get rid of it? You're correct about Oda making convenient use of it but you're wrong about what would have happened without Sabo. It was never going to be "lol Ace is too dumb to spell his own name", if Sabo was never created it would have just been some other character from Ace's past who died or was important to him.</br>  Wind logia or smoke on his coat?  <br>We were talking about joining Law, not Luffy here though. <br>Regardless, I don't think Bellamy's loyalty comes and goes so easily. He might be free from his duty to Doffy, but that doesn't mean he's shameless enough to join Luffy just because he beat Doflamingo. I can't really explain why, but I just can't see Bellamy accepting, even if Luffy invited him.</br></br>  <br>Because you should go to google translate, type "asce" into the translator (set to japanese laguage) and hit the pronounce button</br>  <br> You'd have to be braindead to spell it wrong  <br>I think you're overestimating how smart pirates are in this manga, either that or you don't understand how retarded people have to be for the average gag in manga.</br></br>  <br>you forgot that last chapter had lots of content, anon.</br>  <br>Awakened Wind Paramecia</br>  <br>Smoke coming out from Sabo's burns because explosion.</br>  <br>fuck, Oda, what have you done with Robin's nose? The samefacing is too strong now, dang it.</br>  <br>Why did he and Kuina pretend her death?</br>  I'm happy we got to see some Barto this chapter but it's BULLSHIT he wasn't invited to the sleepover.<br><br>FUCK.</br></br>  <br>Riveting argument, I shall remember it to use it again because it sure proved me wrong.</br>  <br> Binami at the sleepover <br>confirmed nakama</br></br>  <br>How does that change anything?<br>As I've said before, the only difference is <br> Pirate you don't know is doing bad things - WG <br> Pirate you don't know died - WG <br>If he doesn't know him then the death wouldn't do a thing. If he does subconciously know him then just seeing his face and name should be enough.<br>Amnesia's one of the worst fucking twists you can use.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> good and lovable idiot Ace was. I think the first time we see it was when Ace had fallen asleep with his face on the plate, right? <br>It's like you forgot encounter between Luffy and Garp.</br></br>  <br>thanks, no biggie faggot</br>  <br><br>He secretly killed his own daughter cuz she's a girl.<br>And set his hopes on his adopted son, Zoro</br></br></br>  <br> twist <br>What?</br></br>  <br>makes sense</br>  <br>He was just on a burning ship.</br>  <br>That happened how many hundred of chapters later?</br>   Sabo has amnesia when rescued <br> Dragon spoke directly to this kid who was furiously crying about how shitty the nobility is <br> Dragon rescued him after he was shot out of his boat by a Celestial Dragon ship <br> Rather than having Dragon suggest they bring him along considering his outburst during the Grey Terminal incident, Sabo mysteriously remembers not wanting to go back to his parents <br><br>I guess shitty parents could be hard wired but fuck, man, that all just seems dumb.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> was there when Kuina and Zoro made a promise to one another <br> believes in zoro's potential but not in kuina's <br> kills kuina <br>That makes too much sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Moria confirmed bum buddies with Iva-san</br>  <br>It seems a bit stupid that Dragon would even suggest sending him back to his parents after what he said earlier.</br>  <br><br>I agree with you about amnesia, but it's the only thing that would work. <br><br>Given about Sabo's character, he would try to save Ace no matter what if he know about the execution.<br><br>Sabo in general is bad to the story and he should have stayed dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To easy to write off as smoke for the moment, wouldn't bother trying to guess Oda's intent yet.</br>  <br>Wizard of Oz, huh?<br>Yet, the flamingos are from Alice in Wonderland, which also matches with the card theme.<br><br> -A very quick temper.. is very fast to sentence people to death.. -A great love for sweets.. -Queen of Hearts' subjects are mainly animals.. <br> Alice inadvertently eats cake which causes her to grow to giant size.. as the kids eat the candy.. There is also a drink which causes Alice to shrink, and a mushroom which also affects size.. In Carrolls books, this also relates to position in the food chain and fear of being eaten </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just realized Dragon fucked up that Tenryuubito ship big time.<br>Just look at his face, iva has called him reckless as fuck before.<br><br>Saving a kid out of the ocean shouldn't take that long for him, so he had to do something else too.<br><br>Maybe we'll get a  flashback  of him showcasing his DF and how he did it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems stupid to even have Dragon to be there unless Sabo was supposed to join the Revolutionary</br>  <br>Amnesia at times can make you forget certain events, and specific memories you're mind if trained to react too will stay, even if that person with amnesia doesn't exactly remember. Kinda of like a phobia.</br>  <br>It was not Dragon who suggested that</br>  <br>Look at the bottom middle panel. the smoke is coming from Dragon.</br>  <br>Goa was Dragons home and a Tenryuubito was coming, not strange at all him being there</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Why would he do that? If anything he'd try to marry them off so that Zoro could be his actual son and inherit his will.</br>  HOLY FUCK are these threads awful on chapter release day. It's like we got all the shitty Naruto fans after their awful series ended.<br><br>Thanks for telling me the chapter's out, I'll fucking come back in a few days to talk about it, since for now it's so full of cancer and shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Well, it was pretty clear he wouldn't be dead from the moment he was introduced. There would have been no reason to introduce him otherwise. <br><br>I agree though, he should not have been written in in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>Read another translation<br>'These next few days will be messy for Dressrosa'</br></br>  <br> hey, your brother died right? <br> yeah <br> what are you going to do to memorialize him? <br> I'm going to spell my name wrong in some sort of code <br> why don't you just have a separate tattoo of an item he wore or his name? <br> shut up and spell my name wrong so I look like an idiot! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  what is the bigger aspull, sabo or haki?  this thread is even worse than Berserk threads when the trio of tripfags is up at the same time. And that's saying something.<br><br>I would have liked the chapter more if hadn't known that next week OP is on break.

I don't complain about it because it's kind of pointless and I do agree that some characters were borderline undefeatable before it (logias), but goddamn. He could've used, I don't know, a major implementation of Kairoseki for that or something.</br>  <br> thinking the tattoo is just supposed to mean Ace is an idiot when he was never shown being nearly that dumb <br> calling someone else a retard <br>Top kek.</br></br></br>  <br>Just randomly sticking his initial in the middle of his name makes no sense.</br>  <br><br>Niggerfist was an asspull.<br><br>It made some sense because luffy used it, vulcanization and all.<br>And then everyone and their grandmothers used it because muh will &gt; your will</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm agreeing with the amnesia bullshit.Feels Oda couldn't think of anything else as to why this new character couldn't be there.</br>    <br><br><br> Oda simply reapproriated the tattoo that was originally meant to show Ace as a goof. <br><br>Pretty much this.<br><br>Oda is not a time lord who can see into future.

Haki does not negate devil fruits.<br>2. Oda clearly had plans for haki, but obviously at this point in time hadn't fleshed out the idea of armament haki enough in his mind. Observation haki was hinted on Little Garden and conquerors haki was hinted with Shanks at the beginning.<br><br>Re-read the Baratie arc if you don't believe that will, spirit and ambition isn't a core part of the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if asspull is the correct term, but haki is just bullshit written in to appeal to the changing demographic of One Piece and Jump. They wanted to make it more of a battle comic and this sort of spiritual energy is popular and can make weaklings with no muscles (average 14 yo jap that reads OP) look badass.<br><br>They should have sticked with weapons and devil fruits and kept the comic as an adventure rather than battle one.</br></br></br>  <br>kill yourself samefag</br>  <br><br> it must've been a while since you were last punched...!! </br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he's referring to the 'must've been a while since you were last punched'. With Armament Haki what wouldn't really make sense</br>  <br> What is reading comprehension <br><br>I already said at that point in time the idea of armament haki wasn't fleshed out enough.</br></br></br>  <br> conquerors haki was hinted with Shanks at the beginning. <br>Not true, the sea king would've been knocked out.<br>What CoO was in Little Garden?</br></br></br>  <br> They wanted to make it more of a battle comic and this sort of spiritual energy is popular and can make weaklings with no muscles (average 14 yo jap that reads OP) look badass. <br>That makes no sense, One Piece was already doing the whole "weak looking strong guy" way before Haki was introduced. Devil fruits could serve that purpose just as well as Haki.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Last time he got canonically punched was by jinbe, and he too didn't need haki, because water!</br></br></br>  <br><br> Blackbeard specifically says it's because of his DF <br> Haki <br><br>That's a dumb material to use. <br><br> Haki was used in Skypeia Island as Mantra. &gt;Shanks makes everyone around him lose conciousness <br> Strong characters could deal damage against logia/paramecia <br><br>There, Oda planned Haki, or specifically he planned something that would be able to fight devil fruit powers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realize Haki was required right?<br>How would you fight a man made of magma/light/smoke? Luffy would have to be a weapon user like Smoker with a seastone weapon.</br></br>  <br>no it was whitebeard</br>  <br>Luffy confirmed that it was conquerors haki when talking to Rayleigh.<br><br>CoO was hinted when Luffy found Mr 3 among the wax mannequin clones.</br></br></br>  <br>WB.</br>  <br>Haki is the three forms that are around now. Will and spirit or what not are a given in any manga. Mantra was meant to be only for Skypiean and was salvaged for haki. Intimidation is hardly an asspull, but the haki as a system is. Remember nen?</br>  The only haki i'm fine with is Observation<br><br>Conqueror is nothing but crapcleaner.exe<br><br>And arma already makes very little sense, purely deviced to counter OP as fuck logias</br></br></br></br>  <br>They managed hundreds of chapters without it just fine. Luffy even defeated logias before haki.</br>  <br>Look, japanese people have a different relation to writing than we do. They cringe when someone treats carelessly a card with their name on it. Because it's not just a bunch of letters that' written down there, it is them. They intentionally change kanji to convey a hidden meaning in a sentence and they can as long as the pronunciation is the same, even if that would be considered a grammar fault in any other language. They can put nonsensical syllabes in between kanjis and/or sentences just for the heck of it. To them, our writing system is but an agglomerated bunch of letters with nothing holding them together. Hell, even these letters are nonsensical because they don't have stroke orders. Spelling isn't an issue as long as the pronunciation is the okay. So why wouldn't they be able to put <br>Japanese people have no notion of western orthography and how important it is for us.</br></br>  What does /a/ think of GATE? I'm into it  but that's probably because I have a serious drug problem   <br> Likes GATE <br> Into hard drugs <br>Are you me?</br></br></br>  Have you ever heard of a single person not regretting doing hard drugs?

I lost interest pretty fast.</br>  <br>Looks dumb, might be fun, probably will just be dumb.</br>  <br>You should read anything written by Harry Turtledove. He basically makes tons of books exactly like GATE except they're far better in premise and storytelling. <br><br>In one white supremacists travel back to the south during the American civil war and give Robert E. Lee a ton of AK47s, then they get their shit pushed in by Robert E. Lee because he and the majority of the south at the time didn't give a fuck about slavery.</br></br></br>  I think its fucking hilarious so far. Probably going to turn to shit but I enjoy the premise of filthy barbarians trying to fight modern military. Its dumb but I like it.   A-1 Pictures <br> Light Novel <br><br>Haven't seen it but I already know it's trash.</br></br></br>  <br>Really it only goes to shit when politics outside of the gate are involved. Don't even need to check up on the author to know he very likely was not a political officer. Infantry know jack shit about politics, that's why they're infantry.</br>  <br> I enjoy the premise of filthy barbarians trying to fight modern military <br><br>I just feel bad for the medieval guys. They're so outclassed it's not even funny.</br></br></br>  I think the story itself is stupid but it's pretty funny  I like reading it, though I speed up a bit when it gets a lil too heavy on the nationalism.<br><br>Still, nothing wrong with liking shows that have a tendency to wank their source country. Hi, Stargate</br></br>  <br>your opinion and example don't match up</br>  Just a slight update on the Alphabet.

The premise of blowing away a million guys in chainmail with machine guns is pretty solid. HOpefully next epsiode we will find out who will win a fight between a dragon and 100 japanese tanks</br>  <br> Yeah, I noticed that myself too, just a moment agoâthe only reason I'm in this thread, actually. <br>With some luck we should get more words to work with soon.<br> I look forward to the armistice agreement.

Its really really really boring. I'm down for the concept, and I understand where they're coming from, but the whole ' Modern Military Might shall overcome everything ' is just dull as all hell. I'm hoping with the split of smaller recon groups every fight will stop being a complete curb stomp as it has been so far.</br>  <br>Would an ancient roman shield even be any good in stopping bullets?</br>  <br> If Japan wants a military might wankfest where they nuke a bunch of cave men that's fine but why does everyone else have to be a bad guy <br>Who is "everyone else"?<br>Because the Empire is just being an Empire, conquring other countries like what ancient peoples do. If you are not conquring then you are a target for conquest.<br>And America, Russia and China are not more evil than usual.

The Gate special forces walked into a trap because they were told to. So they died.

Both the show itself and the butthurt from autists who can't into fictional settings.</br>  <br>Darkest of days</br>  <br>If I lie to an otherwise trustworthy doctor to get the pills I want, are they acceptable? <br><br>  I lied about having ADD and also back pain, have received at various times in my life ritalin, amphetamines and opiates  <br><br>Doctors aren't omniscient wisdom machines you know, they are people just like the rest of us.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Japs win. That's pretty obvious.</br>  <br>Pretty much this. The whole thing just feels so forced.</br>  <br><br>You realize that in the event of a likely war the first thing EU countries would do is dump money on militarization right? They have the money to outspend any other group possibly bar the US easily.<br><br>The EU is a world power because it has the largest economy in the world and could easily support one of the if not the strongest military if needed. Right now no EU is going to waste money funding a military for defense when the US provides it for free.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Doctors aren't omniscient wisdom machines you know, they are people just like the rest of us. <br>As someone who is in the field, let me tell you it has nothing to do with lack of wisdom; we give you the script because it is irresponsible for us to treat people in pain like they are actually potential criminals. We unfortunately give liars like you drugs because we wanted to make sure people who needed help actually get them. <br>To make it worse, there are those who do genuinely need the drug, who ended up not taking them because they decided to make money selling the prescription on the black market for a profit instead. You can only help those willing to accept it.</br></br></br>  <br>And the Empire is so strawman evil it's not even funny.</br>  <br><br><br>These<br><br>Where's the drama<br><br>Blasting the fuck out of dudes is fun for a bit but just steam rolling the comically evil baddy isn't very entertaining</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And the Empire is so strawman evil it's not even funny. <br>What?<br>No they are not. They act perfectly rationally for a world where diplomacy barely exists. The Empire is on such shaky ground that they are more afraid of a rebellion than what amounts to alien invaders. There is no safety, no security, and laws only exist if you have the arms to back it up. People are cruel in that world because there was no other option.</br></br></br>  <br>France would have done a decent job. Shame they are not in the anime.</br>  <br><br> Live in world where diplomacy doesnt really exist <br> empire is on shaky ground where they are afraid of rebellion and invasion <br> i know lets attack another universe randomly becauseidklol </br></br></br></br>  <br>the empire and the emperor were stable untill the fuck up with the gate</br>  <br> not sending scouts beforehand <br><br>How did they get into power in the first place again?</br></br></br>  <br> i know lets attack another universe randomly becauseidklol <br>They're an empire, and from their perspective (that doesn't understand technology and peace) attacking them can only bring profit. I mean, free land, you know?<br><br>Of course, Japan turned out to not be the savage pushovers they thought they'd be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In short, they gotta suck JDSF's tiny Japanese dick if they're going to have a better life.</br>  <br>Again<br><br> not sending scouts beforehand <br><br>Even cavemen know this shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's alright not bad as I thought it would be.<br><br>I really just want my axe wielding goth loli though.</br></br>  <br> &gt;i know lets attack another universe randomly becauseidklol <br>They already subjugated their known world. An Empire can only survive by expansion, they attack because they had to. The soldiers need to get war loot or they get restless.<br><br>Ancient Japan actually did something similar. The nation was finally unified, but there were far too many extra soldiers left over. So the Shogun went and told a large chunk of them to conquer China/Korea, and nearly all of the troops died. The mission was always meant to fail, because the nation was otherwise at peace and there is no way they could keep the soldiers happy.<br><br>The Empire in this case wanted to succeed, because they needed the war loot to maintain the standing army.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They did though, they brought some people back from the other side, turned them into sex slaves and decided that it was easy to take over...</br>  <br><br>They did send scouts a few months or so before, but they mostly just abducted a few people to learn about them. They learned that Japan's "emperor" basically had no power, the country was in absolute peace, and no one they could see that had what they would recognize as a "weapon".<br><br>This will be covered later in the season.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;not sending scouts beforehand <br>The DID, but it is sort of a plot spoiler. You re not suppose to know that because the JSDF doesn't know that yet.</br></br>  <br><br><br> in a totally alien world <br> not even bothering to learn their culture and technology properly before invading <br><br>Holy shit, why are they so dumb?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gate story isn't about the fights and Arnus Hill was the last battle between the JSDF and the Empire</br>  <br> Ancient Japan actually did something similar <br><br>And the author will never mention this because NIPPON STRONK</br></br></br>  <br>the concept had potential, but the execution of was terrible, its like the author cant decide what to do with the history</br>  <br> Gate story isn't about the fights  <br><br>Yes, it's about wank and waifus.</br></br></br>  <br>some cheap politic and gunporn aswell</br>  <br>These people don't know what gunpowder or science is, anon.<br>They simply don't understand what they're looking at, and the top brass never actually get to see for themselves, and assume the scouts are delusional.<br>Ultimately, like  said, they needed to invade anyways, and were willing to assume that the other side of the gate wasn't that great.<br><br>You'll see through most of the series, just how lacking in comprehension the empire and top people are, when it comes to just how out-gunned they are, because they can't fathom our modern military, and by comparison some of them that actually see it all compare the JSDF close to gods in power (Even though the real Gods in that world would just blink them out of existence)<br><br>The Empire just can't understand a "peaceful nation" that also has a military capable of wiping them out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And the author will never mention this because NIPPON STRONK <br>Err... The Empire IS essentially IMPERIAL JAPAN. Just because they look Roman physically doesn't mean they are. <br><br>The Gate assault is basically Pearl Harbour, Japan kicking a Hornet's nest and got the shit kicked out of them. This is not lost to the Japanese readers. You think Japanese readers gave a damn about Roman culture?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>If this is what its about then probably not the type for me. The gun porn is neat and all, but the political stuff seems so generic and equally as dull as their one sided fights.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the manga is good, just take a look at it</br>  <br> You'll see through most of the series, just how lacking in comprehension the empire and top people are, when it comes to just how out-gunned they are, because they can't fathom our modern military, and by comparison some of them that actually see it all compare the JSDF close to gods in power (Even though the real Gods in that world would just blink them out of existence) <br><br>Yep, wank.<br><br>I feel bad for the Empire. And no amount of LOL WE'RE SLAVERS is going to change that, I'm afraid.<br><br><br> You think Japanese readers gave a damn about Roman culture? <br><br>They'd think it's a generic medieval European world they're so familiar from Dragon Quest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, no it's not.<br><br><br>Considering the author whitewashes Japan's involvement in WW2...</br></br></br></br>  <br> The Gate assault is basically Pearl Harbour, Japan kicking a Hornet's nest and got the shit kicked out of them <br>Japan's strategy had a pretty high chance of success if they didn't fuck up their encryption and get themselves ambushed at Midway like the retards they were.</br></br>  <br>It's weird. I'm a big Star Trek fan, I loved advanced humanity vs primitive civilizations. I mean sure I LOVE when we crush someone, but I also the ethics of it, how would we communicate, how would we see each others civilizations, how would they primitives see our technology. <br><br>The problem with Gate is what many said it's too pandering. Not enough of the boring stuff, communication, languages, technology, us researching magic, using discovering new materials and so on.<br><br>Basically what I want is a new Star Trek with all these cool discussions. <br><br>But Gate is the best I get so it's fantastic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's WW2 propaganda again, where Japan is liberating the local population from their western overlords.</br>  <br> Considering the author whitewashes Japan's involvement in WW2... <br>Err... He did not. Unless by involvement, you mean warcrimes? Because the story never pretended WW2 didn't happen. In fact at one point the Emperor told the JSDF "don't be so arrogant, you would one day lose too". To which the diplomat replied "Actually, that already happened, we already lost and got over it."</br></br>  <br> But Gate is the best I get so it's fantastic <br><br> I like eating shit because it's the tastiest shit I got </br></br></br>  <br>Yep, warcrimes. They pretend the Japanese never did horrible shit to the natives they conquered.</br>  <br>When you can't find food and shit has at least some nutrition and won't poison you. <br><br>Well in that case... You'll eat shit.</br></br></br>  Angry PiÃ±a is best PiÃ±a<br> Persia is fine too </br>  <br>Migrate to a different place then.</br>  <br> Yep, warcrimes. They pretend the Japanese never did horrible shit to the natives they conquered. <br>At this point everything I could said had been said before. But if you think Japan is particularly worse than any other country on this matter, you don't understand how countries work.</br></br>  <br> comparing an unrepentant nation to western countries where they're guilt tripping every day to the minorities they invaded hundreds of years ago <br><br>Fuck off weaboo.</br></br></br>  <br> what did you do to my husbando? <br><br>It's really sad how she can only be threatening when it involves the harem MC.</br></br></br>  <br> Fuck off weaboo. <br>Japan is the king of gilt trips. You must have no idea how much self shaming they do to themselves.</br></br>  <br>I know burgerland is the worst country on that matter, but yuro countries like France or Germany feel so guilty that's almost cringeworthy</br>  <br>Theres no places for me.<br><br>Complex Sci fi or Fantasy is only alive in books. <br><br>Both TV shows and Anime are very far from it right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the biggest tragedy in Japan history, the sheer delusion and the fact that they can't comprehend their overall atrocities. Have they ever apologized for Nanking? Or for their rampant warcrimes? They had 13 year old girls sent after the army for them to play with, jesus christ. Even America (which was overall a good guy) is being reprimanded for their interment camps.</br>  <br> America (which was overall a good guy) <br> this is what americans believe </br></br>  <br>I don't see how this is any better or worse then Soviets, Nazis and 99% of every single war and crime before 1800.<br><br>Child whores aren't a new thing. From Rome all the way up to todays afganistan it's normal.</br></br></br>  <br>It would have been the same situation if they had beaten the shit out of anyone else in the JSDFâItami was just unfortunate enough to let himself be beaten up.<br><br>How can you even think of this as valid criticism?</br></br></br>  <br>I am European, but don't you think that it is telling that the whole of Germany was rushing to have America invade them? There were generals taking their armies to go to the west, all afraid of the Russians.</br>  <br>She wasn't running for the Itamibowl yet</br>  <br> morality applies to nation states <br>What are you, twelve? Do you realise that the US has killed far more people than Japan could ever dreamed of, or that they took those evil nip and German scientists who did all of those unspeakable things and gave them amnesty?</br></br>  <br>Japanese experiments were worse than Mengele's experiments. Germany raping through Russia and Russia raping back at them was still on a smaller scale than Nanking. Heck the Japanese brass simply let the soldiers do whatever they wanted for 7 days. There was always order in the war crimes Russia and Germany did. Basically everything all countries did that were considered war crimes, Japan did them all.</br>  <br>Oh i am well aware of that u idiot. Still that doesn't compare to all the evil shit Japan did to civilians...</br>  <br>They forgot to guilt trip themselves about WW2 though.</br>  The show would be infinitely better with Russians, Murrikans, Fins, Poles, or Germans as the lead military.<br><br>JSDF is boring as fuck in fiction and in real life. All they do is make otaku jokes and try to make shit kawaii or puns.<br><br>The only thing left after that is nihon banzai fantasies because they're so boring.<br><br>Where are my armyfag assholes in a shitty sandbag clunker bunker piece of shit on a hill teaching local monster girls how to do Thriller and shadow bronco busting dragons while playing peekaboo in tanks and dancing in front of explosions?<br><br>Or my ruskies dancing around vodka or throwing knives at snake girls to pass the time.<br><br>Or the Fins, the fucking glorious Fins.

It's modern, cynical, cultural imperialism too, not dumb "we need to take our guns and katana folded 50 times to show those savages the glory of nippon".<br>The actual show opposes this viewpoint and clearly show that the Japanese are the bad guys.</br></br>  <br>Side story Vol 2, villain's name and Mabel's delusion?<br>Maybe I'm reading too deep.</br></br>  <br>OC is a bit more than that I think because Matoba is allowing the government plants to fail and the empire side knew what Japan was up to all along. <br>I would say different people trying different things in that story and some are into money just like some people always are and others are observing how things would go in the long run.</br></br>  the MC isn't a self-insert.<br><br>it's very rare that an 'otaku' or 'nerd' is actually in the military, knows the basics of CQC enough to apply a choke hold and stab someone's heart, can use rifles, and at the same time not completely have a mental breakdown when given command of a recon squad.</br></br>  <br>Itami is a ranger.<br>What he is doing right now is like a walk in the park</br></br>  <br> it's very rare that an 'otaku' or 'nerd' is actually in the military <br><br>It can't be that rare.</br></br></br>  <br>that he is. I was also under the impression that he was already some sort of relatively high ranking guy before going through the Gate.<br><br>personally, I don't like the anime's emphasis on him being an otaku, but I guess they have to give him some personality to keep him interesting.<br><br>he's really not just some incompetent nerd with a rifle, and somehow the show gives off that vibe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that girl was an idol or some shit but every western army and the JSDF have "otaku"</br>  <br>yeah but I'm talking about 'self-insert borderline incompetent beta harem MC' otaku</br>  Reminder that Kuribayashi eventually fell for Itami in the original web version, but was downgraded from a heroine in the novel version. <br><br>Why</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure a bunch of those are in the military.<br>Since the military is the place where people with no motivation in life go.</br></br>  <br>less bitches in the Itami harem the author had to worry about</br>  Came for the guns, stayed for the immortal loli goddess   yamato damashi face Japan's full might of military domination and reminiscence about WW2:The story   <br>I was kinda psyched for it. I've always been into shows about two very different groups interacting with each other. But I can already see that this will just be about magical girls going after MC. Oh well</br>  <br> Kuribayashi eventually fell for Itami in the original web version, <br>Ew<br><br> but was downgraded from a heroine in the novel version. <br>It's for the best. Seriously. I rather he be forever without a man, than with Itami, competing with a bunch of others.<br><br>I don't see the need to specifically pair girls you like to the MC, if you don't actually self-insert.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   every single Gate thread ever <br> Japan propaganda wankfest <br> USA USA USA wankfest <br> MUH REALISM </br></br></br>  <br>At least the "muh magic" troll fell off pretty early.<br>But yeah, that's pretty much every thread ever, if you exclude the noise and occasional waifu and pairing shit.</br></br>  <br>It's true, Kuri was kicked out of the Harem in the novel version, but Princess Pina was upgraded from a villain to a heroine. <br><br>Lose one, gain one.</br></br></br>  <br>They also ruined her looks. The fight with the prince will be John Woo because if she brute forces then im done. An idol just out doing a guy thats 5 times her size is stupid.</br>  <br>He got lucky. Superior officers saw his rep sheet and he literally did nothing to get into the rangers as a series of unfortunate events got him there.</br>  <br>So just out of curiosity, how did Pina become a villain in the web novel version?</br>  <br>I don't remember humvees being that huge.</br>  <br><br>Did not read web version but I hear she killed Lelei to get gate closed permanently which is a very princessy sort of thing to do actually.</br></br>  <br>Lelei, the human mage got killed?<br><br>damn.</br></br></br>  <br> she killed Lelei <br>How?<br>Or was Lelei not as overpowered in the web novel?</br></br></br>  Watching those medieval folks getting destroyed got me excited.  <br> Or was Lelei not as overpowered in the web novel? <br>She is NEVER overpowered. She is still a squishy mage.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I think the easiest trolling is to take truth and throwing shocking false statements. <br><br>No, web Pina went nuts and attempted to kill Lelei <br>She didn't succeed in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's overpowered when using the normal mages of her world as a standard. So yeah.<br><br><br>Explain. So her actions pretty much follow how she went about everything in the novel, until at some point she just snapped?</br></br></br></br>  <br>4 and 5 is easy:<br>Let Arnus community to build a fucking real 5 star hotel for merchants. With A/C, running water and TV.<br>Soon ALL Empire vassals want to get under wing of Japan, much like failed states like Ukraine want USA to come.</br></br></br>  <br>And she is only strong because she can explain shit now</br>  <br>None of the side characters were well developed in the web version (which is a lot shorter), and Pina didn't have many of the developments we currently have.<br>In the end she pretty much gives up trying, and decides that making sure the gate never opens again is the best course of action and attempts to assassinate Lelei.</br></br>  <br><br>Just to be clear, Gate novels predates Outbreak Company by FIVE years. <br><br>If anything Outbreak Company ripped off the Gate author.<br>Kodansha muscled their rip-off product to get animated first over the much smaller company Alphapolis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 4 and 5 is easy: <br>A few nobles are as good as nothing. It's small people who do heavy lifting for you and kill your enemies that matters.</br></br>  <br>Several villain names are based on Korean dish that Japs often use when making fun of gooks. <br>I'm pretty sure that's more than enough hints.</br></br>  <br> Several villain names are based on Korean dish that Japs often use when making fun of gooks. <br>All that proves is that the author doesn't like Koreans very much. That as it may how does that have any relation to GATE, where Koreans took no part in the story other than as minor protesters?</br></br>  <br>Meh, that kind of shit is merely Dragon Quest's Merazoma tier.</br>  <br>thats how magic work in gate world</br>  <br>Are you illiterate? We WERE only talking about how author feels about Koreans. <br>None of the shit you're babbling about Gate. <br><br>This string of conversations were in reply to <br> he seem to have some grievances towards China and Korea. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Meh, that kind of shit is merely Dragon Quest's Merazoma tier. <br>The point is she managed to increase her spell power with no increase in casting costs. You can basically do any shit you like with magic in her world, but people who aren't gods don't have much magic reserves.</br></br>  <br>That's like making a bad guy called Haram McKebab and arguing it's not racist because he's not a muslim.</br>  <br> Are you illiterate? We WERE only talking about how author feels about Koreans. <br>Well I assumed you mean Koreans are slandered in the story. If it is just Korean names but the characters themselves aren't Korean, what's the problem?</br></br>  <br>I had to do my 1 year service recently.<br>One of the youngest officers we had there (graduated from West Point equivalent) was a LoL maniac.<br>Like spending half his paycheck every month on shit.<br><br>So it's not a stretch</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's like making a bad guy called Haram McKebab and arguing it's not racist because he's not a muslim. <br>Well that would be like calling a white Norwegian a nigger. Technically an insult but so far removed that it is hard to get upset.</br></br>  I watched the first episode and was putoff by the pacing. <br><br> guy walking to some convetion <br> suddenly stargate opens  <br> he becomes badass and reks some knight out of nowhere  <br> authorities start listening to this faggot for no real reason </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Dragon Quest's fantasy world already has gunpowder. No muskets though. Just cannons.</br>  <br> &gt;he becomes badass and reks some knight out of nowhere  <br>He already was a badass. <br> &gt;authorities start listening to this faggot for no real reason <br>They kind of dropped the ball in the anime here. In the manga, he shows them his military ID.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Friend is a marine and is deadly obsessed with tf2.

I guess they are just too busy doing something else. Or they simply don't care.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128058721 <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br><br>Good, because you sound like a faggot.</br></br>  <br>and that's what is incredibly stupid, an entirely new technology ignored<br><br><br> because not everyone can use magic <br>citation would be appreciated<br> mages confirmed science to be more effective unless you aren't a talented mage who can combine them into one thing like Lelei. <br>Magic is strategically worthless<br>who's talking about combat?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is something I'm annoyed is missing from the manga. If a device that could transport stuff between dimensions appeared, I would expect every physicist would flock to it to try and replicate it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah something (or someone) is incredibly stupid in this thread or nitpicky about shit that isn't focus of the show which is NIPON STRONK power fantasy with monster girls where other nations are retarded and otaku MC happens to be Ranger, previously married and a good friend with top government people. <br>Seriously stop, you're starting to sound autistic.</br></br>  <br>It's implied in the story magic isn't something everyone can use and a resoruce is strategically worthless when it doesn't have a real utility, not only as military stuff.<br>Everything magic can do can be done faster and better by cheaper tech from our world.<br>The only serious magic worth to study would be the kind used by Gods but thats not something avaible to mortals ecept for very rare eceptions so it's worthless too.</br></br></br>  <br>The Gate was built by mages around a wap hole made by the Goddess Hardy, thats the only kind of shit physicist wouldn't be able to replicate. <br> Leilei will manage to reopen the Gate with physics application on magic only because the dimensional wall between the worlds in the Arnus was very thin due the previous gate. She still can't open portals left and right even if she knows how to do it </br></br>  <br><br>But they don't know that. I would expect plenty of people working to wrap hypotheses and laws around magic.</br></br>  <br>this looks interesting because "muh fantasy"</br>  Are you telling me that given some time (and access to Wikipedia) Lelei will learn modern physics and start throwing antimater around like...<br><br> Onii-Sama! </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128058721 <br>Why dont you go make another failed Madoka thread, moefag.</br>  <br>Yes?</br>  <br><br>A-1 show they probably decided to animate solely because it crossed a certain threshold of LNs sold and likely has a fanatical fanbase they can bait in with benefits. It'll probably crash and burn in a few episodes when the start rushing through the material cause they don't give a fuck. Also getting the Love Live director and composer doesn't get you the Love Live audience though it could just be the Bamco/Aniplex sharing thing they've got going on for when they make the inevitable video game.</br></br>  <br><br>The A-1 special. Try to be the least worst of available options for otaku pandering.</br></br>  <br><br>You're expecting any better from the studio that gave us Aldnoah Zero surpassed of Gundam with the blankets most perfect military genius because reasons character of all time? The studio that also gave us SAO and doesn't seem to understand the first thing about tension? Fuck there were battles early on in Gundam 00 when the Gundam outclassed everything the 3rd Earth factions had that were more tense than Inaho vs OP mech of the week where you just felt bad for the Vers guy. Considering the directors most significant contribution to anime to date has been pretty school girls singing and dancing I wouldn't expect too much military insight either.</br></br>  <br>This is a dire threat to security/continued existence of both worlds. It would be irresponsible to leave multi-megaton weaponary in the hands of a single person.<br><br>I think the mage problem needs a solution... a final solution.</br></br></br>  <br> The mission was always meant to fail <br>Best excuse for Japan getting trashed in the Imjin war I've ever heard</br></br>  Am I the only one who was chuckling like a fucking idiot when the notroman armies were slaughtered? Those reactions were fucking priceless.  <br><br>Considering I'm pretty sure its supplied by Lantis that's not a huge surprise. For /as sake as an example they're the ones responsible for Hibike.</br></br>  <br>Butthurt gooks please</br>  <br>Is this as creepy in its nationalism as a lot of other overtly patriotic anime?</br>  <br> Doesn't she only really learn how to mess with the portals though after Hardy possesses her?  </br>  <br> because not everyone can use magic <br> citation would be appreciated <br>It's something that should come up later but basically our Earth isn't the first world that Gate world has connected to. In the past there was tons of other worlds and in one of those other worlds were humans that could use magic. At the present in Gate world you have to be descended from one of those groups of humans to be a possible magical practitioner.</br></br></br>  <br> What does /a/ think of GATE? <br><br>I like it.<br><br>It's fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> four-eyes and bunny waitress who nearly killed him <br>This still gets to me, yet I still want to see it.</br></br>  <br><br>Well she was manipulated.<br><br>I still like it though.<br><br> Him losing his shit before Itami went after the flame dragon had me laugh hard </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No Sugawara x palace loli <br>Step up, chart.</br></br>  <br> stop trying to discuss the show, you should just post epic memes and waifufag <br>I'm over 1 hour late and fuck you</br></br>  <br>This show is the dumbest shit ever.<br><br>And I fucking love it.<br><br>Can't wait for the coming tank/artillery action</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's there though anon.</br>  For the glory of the Nippon Empire!  <br>Not going to lie, if I had a whimpering, sobbing 11-year old virgin loli assigned to me, I'd take her back to my room and strip her filthy clothes off her and  let her bathe and towel up and hide in my room away from the raping soldiers . <br><br>Then I'd go find more lolis and do the same thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, how shamefur of me.</br>  <br>Hunter S.

In fact, the Miyagi prefectural support HQ of the JMSDF tweets about Kancolle shit regularly, and the fucking Kure Yamato Museum has the ship girls as part of its exhibition and it had hosted Kancolle events at that.

The first camp was set up on 24 October 1941, in Petrozavodsk. About 4000 of the prisoners perished due to malnourishment, 90% of them during the spring and summer of 1942 <br><br>These are some pretty dirty hands for "good guys"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>muh ruskie<br><br>dey gud boyz, deyz just tryna get land for dem 10 year prograyms</br></br></br>  <br><br> Cobra's shown <br> But without waifu paint job <br><br>The ball has been dropped</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Read the fucking thread.

You either bite the bullet and subjugate the entire population with an iron fist, or just use soft power and minimise direct influence of a vassal state.

The new wires are not much more effective than the old barbed wire, but they take up less space in storage so is preferred.

No movment in thier relatioship, then author went Kubo style and acted like none of development was made before. He made it pure friendship.

In this story, the Gundam will also change its form and grow stronger along with the heroes personal growth. It is also revealed that each major power in the world also has several Gundams.</br>  <br>It is a world roughly three hundred years after the end of a great conflict known as the âCalamity Warâ.<br><br>The Earth Sphere lost its previous system of government and a new world was built with a new ruling system. While a transient peace had come, the embers of a new conflict was born on Mars, far removed from Earth.<br><br>The main character, a young boy named Mikazuki Augus, belongs to the civilian security company Chryse Guard Security (CGS). He is tasked with guarding Cuderia Aina Bernstein, a young girl who is trying to make the Martian city of Chryse independent from the rule of one of Earthâs powers. However, the CGS comes under attack from the armed organization Gjallarhorn trying to nip the bud of insurrection, so Mikazuki and the children start withdrawing as a decoy. The leader of the boys, Orga Itsuka, takes advantage of this occasion to rise in revolt against the adults who oppressed them and stages a coup dâetat. Mikazuki, who was entrusted to fend off the Gjallarhorn by Orga, takes up the fight by using the Gundam Barbatos, a mobile suit from the âCalamity Warâ that was utilized as a nuclear reactor by the CGS.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I need Corin Nander to blow this monstrosity up. Or for the Turn-A to Moonlight Butterfly all over it and send it back to the stone age. Fuck this shit.</br>  <br>That V-fin really needs to go</br>  <br>Those are some sexy-ass v-fins on the Gundam. Not terribly fond of the "incomplete" look on it, though. Mostly in the waist.</br>  <br>The only good thing so far is the grunt design and that's ripped from A/Z. Fuck.</br>  <br>looks familiar<br> stick to a/z faggot </br></br>    <br>It steals parts to upgrade supposedly. Heard it in the live stream last night.</br>  <br>Gundam.</br>  <br>Hoping the first thing it rectifies is the thin waist. How does it even hold up it's own weight? Those pistons don't look capable enough.</br>  I thought it was going to be bulky as fuck.  I think everything about this show looks pretty cool and interesting (a bit too much on the girlbait but whatever, it's Gundam). I really am interested in seeing the "take weapons for itself" part<br><br>However that director and writer is such an elephant in the room</br></br>  Real Gundams have curves, like the Virtue.  <br> Hoping the first thing it rectifies is the thin waist. How does it even hold up it's own weight? Those pistons don't look capable enough. <br>Actually most Gundams that have a waist that moves generally only have a loose connection, it is not load-bearing unless we are talking about RX-78-2 and its fixed inflexible body.</br></br>  <br>Look at all these curves</br>  <br>Surely there's more to it than such a small mechanism working to uphold the weight for most other Gundams. It looks as though it would be falling backwards with how the weight is distributed. Doesn't the ZZ have a much larger, similar mechanism beneath the armor plating to uphold the upper half?<br><br><br>The entire "taking weapons for itself" idea reminds me far too much of the Z-Knuckle from Mega Man Zero 4. Especially with the pincers and lances shown on the grunt units for the models.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Erina-sama <br> Guts <br> SamFlam <br> Schneizel <br>All these characters seem reminiscent of other people.<br><br>But I'm just glad we're getting something a little more grounded after Le quirky G-Reco.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The entire "taking weapons for itself" idea reminds me far too much of the Z-Knuckle from Mega Man Zero 4. <br> being this much of a newfag <br><br>You realize that 'taking weapons for itself' is the underlying basis for every Mega Man game ever made since the very beginning, right?<br><br><br> I'm just glad we're getting something a little more grounded <br> show about impossible terraforming of Mars <br>K</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course. But I'm not picturing it like the Classic/X/Zero (special abilities) way, where it's permanently part of their arsenal. It can be done away with in favor of something else, which will likely be the case throughout the entire series.<br><br>Though the armor pieces from the X series would be a more fitting comparison, since the Gundam will most likely be enhanced for performance and not for situational.</br></br></br>  <br>I said "a little".<br><br>Gundam will never be hard sci-fi, I know that.<br>But G-Reco was just too much zaniness.<br><br>I like when it's more like a proper Space Opera or pseudo-military drama.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not as bulky as I first expected.</br>  <br>Ah there you are.

Big sis wonât forgive you if you make Yukinoâchan cry.â <br><br>  2. âOh, that reminds me. Hikigayaâkun. Wanna go out for tea with me if youâre free? I have to make sure youâre good enough to be Yukinoâchanâs boyfriend.â Harunoâ san threw out her chest and winked lightly in my direction. <br><br>  3. âYeah, youâre right. It has nothing to do with me,â she said, pulling back abruptly as if jumping away. âAs long as youâve put thought into it, itâs fine, Yukinoâchan. I was trying to help, but I was butting in. Sorry about that.â <br><br>  4. It mightâve been due to looking at Yukinoshita Haruno with a perceptive view that I felt that Haruno-san might in reality be fond of Yukinoshita. <br><br>  5. âThatâs what everyone says at first. But they all end up doing the same thing. They get jealous of Yukino- chan, hate her, reject her, and then start ostracizing her... I hope that youâll be different from them.â <br><br>  6. âThatâs fine. If a scoundrel like you is actually being diligent, then thatâll rile them up in one way or another. They wonât grow if the enemy doesnât keep it together, after all. <br><br> But with her humorous gesture, her opened eyes were looking over at Yukinoshita. <br><br> That gaze caused a baseless thought to flash into my head. <br><br> âUm, could it beâ¦â <br><br> My moving lips were stopped in place by her soft fingers. <br><br> âI donât like perceptive kids, okay?â <br><br> Suppose that the existence of an enemy is the simplest way to spur human growth. <br><br> Could it be that this person was acting so she could appear as the enemy? I found myself thinking that despite having no proof at all. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nobody sees her suffering.</br></br>  <br>Right is the right choice.<br>We've been over this.</br></br>   you will never kidnap Spyro and force him to translate 24/7 in your basement   Can anyone translate this?    <br>Even if it had Iroha in it I wouldn't be able to TL it because the pic size is too small to recognize the some of the kanji in there.<br>Post a pixiv link or better resolution and wait for that one Yuifag moonfag to do it.</br></br>  <br> small kanji <br>you need glasses man<br> but you're right, there's no Iroha </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> samefagging Irohafag <br><br>topkek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup, you got me.<br>And you don't need to be pissed at the polls because they don't go your way, you know.</br></br>  <br>Your wish is granted.</br>  <br>Albeit the fact that most of /a/ hates her and want nothing more than see her get a truck end, I hope that she gets a good ending. Hopefully 8man can prove her that genuine relationships do exist and make her desire one of her own.<br><br>I think the quote in the picture describes why 8man and Haruno are the way they are and why they feel so skeptical about relationships.</br></br></br>  <br>if you seriously believe that a poll, that was conducted in a thread that has usually 100~ ip's and around 75% that lurking , can't get 5 votes in a min you're an idiot.</br>  <br>nice photo shopping skill faggot.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>No, because next time, he will ask her.</br></br>    Is sensei irrelevant because she plays bass or does she play bass because she's irrelevant?  <br> 444 <br>Confirmed</br></br>  <br>I'm not even mad.<br>I'm half Yukino-kin.<br>Fug you and you trips</br></br></br>  <br>That was like the 6th or 7th poll where Iroha stayed on top.</br>  <br>No, I'm the real samefag.</br>  <br>Wrong sister.</br>  <br>Wow how pathetic,<br>are Irohafags really that desperate?</br></br>  <br>Look everyone it's the last surviving Yuifag.<br>Probably butthurt proxyfag couldn't fuck up those polls or future polls to hide how much Yui is irrelephant.</br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT ANON<br>YOU GOT ME</br></br>  <br> Irrelephant </br>  <br> Irohafags talk about relevance <br><br>Gets me everytime.</br></br></br>   ââ¦Then, that means Iâll just have to ask again.â <br> It was a will brazen and intense that could veil even hostility. Her beautiful eyes were as though they were stars that glowed translucently. <br> It felt like those eyes were telling me: âI wonât make any excuses. So, look at me.â <br><br><br> Crap, I really just couldnât win against her. If sheâs going to tell me something like that with that cute of a face, how could I even say anything back? <br> Suddenly, the words of the fox came to mind. <br> ââWords are the source of misunderstandings, after all. <br> How completely true. <br> You canât clear misunderstandings. There will always be things you canât undo in life and your mistaken answers will stay as they are. <br> Thatâs why instead, you should give up on them and pose the question again. <br> All for the sake of knowing a new and correct answer. <br> Both Yukinoshita and I didnât know each other. <br> What is it we should have to call it âknowingâ? We didnât understand that. <br> Had we just watched each other, then we could have understood too. What is essential is invisible to the eye. Thatâs because we would avert our eyes. <br> I would. <br> We would. <br><br>What exactly were those questions they wanted to ask again?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a comic where 8man speaks his thoughts out loud <br>Oh man. I sure there's more.</br></br>  <br>I dunno if a Kaorifag should be talking about irrelevance.</br>  <br>Yui is 0% elephant.

Even the blondie cocksucker is more legit.<br>Iroha WASN'T EVEN NECESSARY in the novels. It's cheeky good and all, but that's it.

Thanks.</br></br>  <br>Both those posts are two completely different things.<br><br>The first one literally just saying everything Yukino said about herself.<br><br>The second one is going along with the manipulative little girl thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do lolis have such great asses <br><br>They don't, you autistic pedophile</br></br></br>  <br>My big problem with the first response is that it makes it seem that Yukino started off as someone with low self-esteem/dependency issues by default, instead of her becoming that way because she couldn't take the pressure of having to maintain te perfect image of being a Yukinoshita offspring (among other pressures).</br>  <br> Yui already knows that. <br>So how does she feel about Hikki liking boys?</br></br>  <br>Everyone knows about Hikki's obsession with Saika and everyone finds it weird even himself claiming he might love Saika a bit too much.</br>  <br> âWhat exactly did you take pictures of to use up so much memoryâ¦?â <br><br> Yukinoshita stated in astoundment while Yuigahama thought it over and made a big nod. <br><br> âThe Tennis Clubâ¦ So Sai-chan, huhâ¦? I guess thereâs not much we can do there.â <br><br> âYui-senpai, youâre really okay with that!?â <br><br> So she finally gave upâ¦ No, thereâs a small chance she acknowledged itâ¦ <br><br>Judge this by yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Hachiman wanted to cut off his arm or leg, would Yui allow him? Seems like she's really willing to let him do whatever the fuck he wants. I don't know if that's healthy.</br>  <br>Yui has pretty much given up and accepted that she can't control Hikki.</br>  <br>She would tell him that she dislike it like what she did at end vol 7 and vol 10,5 chapter 3.</br>  <br> unconditionally loves Hikki <br> supports him without question <br> accepts him no matter what comes up <br>How is she not genuine?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Give up!

What's with this bullshit in your head?</br></br>   mfw Watari makes Saika a reverse trap in vol 12   <br> wanting to give saika brojobs and cuddle equals permanent disfigurement <br>She just accepts him as a person out of love, not out of fear of him hating her. <br><br>Yui would be able to handle it if he hated her. <br><br><br>She is scary</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hikki, yahallo! <br><br> Sup. <br> Don't come at me so suddenly, my heart skipped a beat. <br><br> Eh? <br><br> W- What was that!.. <br><br> Because of MAX-coffee I had just now. <br> Hikigaya-kun, let Onee-san treat you sometimes &lt;3 <br> Ah... Thanks. <br><br> Drink it carefully &lt;3 <br> Absolutely! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, not really.<br><br> I chose the wrong words when I called the person who was worried for me unfair. I rotated my chair and turned my body towards Yuigahama. I sat there while digging around for the proper words to tell her. Yuigahama, however, didnât give me the time and nodded. <br><br> ââ¦Yeah, I think I am unfair!â Yuigahama said, her voice cheerful and as though she was convinced of something. <br><br> I didnât quite catch the meaning behind her response, but I wanted to get the right nuance across to her and opened my mouth. <br><br> âI didnât mean it like that, but uh, in a good wayâ¦â <br><br> Yuigahama, however, shook her head and interjected. âI thinkâ¦ I really am unfairâ¦ Itâs because I can never stop you or even help you. And alsoâ¦ for a bunch of other things.â <br><br> Yuigahamaâs words were in a jumble, perhaps because she was trying to think while she talked. But itâs due to that that I felt her words were from the bottom of her heart. In the same way sheâd laugh to hide her embarrassment or mumble her words and look away, Iâm sure she wanted to play it off somehow. <br><br> But even so, she looked straight at me, as though wanting to tell me everything. <br><br> âThatâs whyâ¦ Thatâs why, when something like this happens again, Iâll make sure to do it.â <br><br> Her sincere expression and her slowly weaved words were imbued with a sense of reality but also an empty ambiguity. Eventually, everyone would make sure to do it. They had to, even if they didnât know what it is that they needed to do or if they could do it. Iâm sure thatâs something that everyone thinks about, even if vaguely. <br><br>She has her own resolve regarding him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the part where she ran for the stuco president to stop 8man from committing social kamikaze?</br>  <br>She did it to save the club she loved.</br>  <br>And in the end, the ones who saved the club were 8man and Iroha.</br>  <br>And essentially prevent 8man's social suicide. (hence the suki nano)<br>Yui was the first one that noticed what 8man was trying to do.<br><br>Yukino also did this because she wanted to prove 8man's method is wrong, <br>but in her case she actually wanted to become the president in order to surpass Haruno.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino also did this because she wanted to prove 8man's method is wrong, <br>She didn't want him to social sudoku too.</br></br>  <br>By proofing him wrong.<br><br>That is what I meant.</br></br></br>    What was the context when Kyousuke scream to Ayase "Ayase!
