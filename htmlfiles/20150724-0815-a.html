[ Greatest love story ever told.  <br>It could but of course it cant.<br>This is a shonen movie. You have to add shitty fighting and shitty villains. I would have preffered the melodrama over the shitty mission with that super moon Ninja who they spare and befriend at the end. What a load of shit.<br>Some parts of the first half felt really jarring. They felt like they were in modern times in a normal modern city. Also when did Hinata get a sister?</br></br></br>  <br>Can Shiki even touch Uchiha Madara?</br>  <br>The film was amazing and imo tbh  Sakura was a good character since a long long time. She didn't feel annoying at all. I even liked her even more than bes girl during the whole "hurr durr Hinata cucked Naruto"-phase in the movie.  Also the yellow rasenshuriken is sick. They changed the color to what it was meant to be and can just give bullshit excuses like "Naruto is using Kurama's chakra" and shit like that. Fantastic!</br>  <br>any good subs?</br>   thought Naruto has finally come to an end <br> mfw their new project announcement </br>  <br>The version I read had some typos and was even missing like 3 sentences, not sure about other subs.</br>    are the blu-ray rips out?  <br>is this SSG Gai?<br><br>yes</br></br></br>  <br>n-next episode, r-right?</br>  fuck off  <br>Lets hope together</br>  <br>now i have to depend on the new Storm game to do this scene justice<br><br>oh well, i like them anyways.</br></br></br>  rips are out but no english subs just spanish and chinese  <br>which one?</br>  <br>some are pretty badly timed others are incorrect in some spots while one is subbed for most of the movie but misses some spots.<br><br>Once again people got to wait for the definitive version.</br></br></br>  <br>  I have no idea, I watched it on masterani because it was more convenient.  </br>      <br> these moves are out and the manga is done <br> tv series still on a filler </br></br>  <br>Do you expect anything else from the Jewish Japanese?</br>   They completely fucked 8 gates. <br>Now I literally have to rely on a fucking video game to see it done properly.</br>  <br>naruto will never be done<br><br>there is a SoL comic included with every ticket for the new bolt movie<br><br>people will enjoy the comic so much they'll demand kishi to make a new series mainly about sol.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank god it's actually well done and that the lead developer is a faggot about Naruto, so we can expect it to be really good.</br>  yo when the fuck is this game coming out? october?  <br><br>Spooky.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128482456 <br>Go shitpost in the fate threads you faggot.</br>  <br><br>WHO IS THE GUY ON THE VERY BOTTOM OF THIS POSTER</br></br>  <br> Fighting game locked to 30fps <br><br>I will never understand this.</br></br></br>  <br>It's sasuke you silly.</br>  <br> see </br>  <br>They said they are aiming for 1080 60fps on storm 4. i'm expecting a lot of frame drops, and in the gameplay the game lags when sasuke does chibaku tensei or naruto does bijuu rasenshuriken</br>  <br>it's tenten</br>  <br>speaking of storm 4, will Boruto be an actual interesting character in storm 4?<br>my expectations for Sarada are low</br></br>  <br>THEN WHO WAS PHO-2nd from top?</br>  <br>there's not much gameplay at all out there aside from a free battle demo<br><br>the company blows at marketing their game and i bet many people dont even know its coming out on pc</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sai.

I really wonder whether the guy posting it is actually an SJW or something who actually thinks we wouldn't enjoy some good lolipuss.</br>  All the subs I found suck ass. I don't even know Japanese and I can tell some of the lines are pulled out of ass and characrers are saying something else. I've seen some online upload with a little better translation (at least the first 2 minutes on some shit site anilinkz) but I refuse to watch that streamed when I have 1080p downloaded. Where are the fucking decent subs man?  <br>Pretty much this, she gets the better development post series.. most likely because she has come to terms of Sasuage being exiled.

Then the dad is all "We don't need failures in the Hyuuga". Its supposed to draw some parallels between her and Naruto as they both started out as failures and outcasts, seem as demons, but effort allowed them to become more than that.<br><br>After the whole Neji thing the Hyuuga family really started to cool down a bit, get the stick out of their ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hinata firstly did show up in the first test of the Chunin Exam, where she tries to pass her results to Naruto.<br>We don't know about her sister until the prelim fights.</br></br>  <br>I want Hinata to be my  onee-sama <br> Hinata and Tsunade are the only canon big sisters in this series, are they? </br></br>  <br> &gt;mfw their new project announcement <br><br>You're mistaken a bit<br><br>Naruto ended with "The Last Naruto Movie", after that we were in the "Boruto" phase, since Naruto ended. Now its a story about Boruto, as Naruto's story ended with him finally finding a family.<br><br>There's nothing planned beyond this Boruto movie, its the end of the road, and is meant to show a sort of hopeful future as time moves on, a new generation. The continuation of the manga gaiden was just a tie in to this new movie.<br><br>The producers may still milk this, but Kishi said he's out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there is also Kiba's sister, Hana, and, obviously, Temari</br>  <br>oh, my bad</br>  <br> but Kishi said he's out. <br><br>Yeah just like what Toriyama said all those years ago right? He'll be back within 10 years to make more Nardo. It never ends.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that might happen, but it'll probably be awhile.<br><br>Author tries to move onto something else, but you can never escape your big hit at times, no matter how far you try to move on.

They pretty much already had sex.</br>  <br>I guess you're right, Sarada is learning over.<br><br> Do you think Chouchou and Shikadai will hook up and make those two's family life weird? </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe but they will breakup.</br>  <br> will Boruto be an actual interesting character in storm 4? <br> Gentle Fist <br> Shadow Clones <br> Chidori variant <br> Rasengan <br> special move <br> shuriken jutsu <br>You tell me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can't.

She looks around 9-10 in the movie.</br></br>  <br>It always bothered me in the series that every single kid of the main characters ends up being a ninja. Seriously, I would tell my kid to do something else like carpentry or going to law school or anything. Why do all these parents want to send their kids to die off in war?</br>  <br> Is that Naruto's girl on the right? Isn't she way younger than those two? <br><br>everyone thought she was like 6 years younger when pics of the cakening leaked, but everything else makes her look maybe 2-3 years younger.<br><br>Metal Lee looked younger in 700 but he seems to be ~12 like all the other chunin candidates in the new movie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> condom <br>And jeopardize the plan?

Sakura's parents own a flower shop.

Who's kid is that if it isn't?</br>  <br> I think that Hiagi Euginics series of images is the singular thing that makes learning all of the Naruto lore worth it. so fucking hysterical <br><br>the keikaku is more impressive when one realizes it was pretty much just made up by NHfags to mock Kishi's storywriting skills and to taunt NSfags after he tipped his hand about the ending with the Homura/Kaguya w/ byakugan stuff.<br><br>  being Kishi, the actual execution of the story epilogue was kind of crap as usual, but best girl winning with kids has given me untold amount of free entertainment from the tears of disappointed shippers </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds just like Hinata if she were dumped by Nurudo.</br>  <br>Are the animators fucking stupid.<br><br>They forgot to draw Kakashi's sharingan, on promotional material!<br><br>That shows you the kind of care they take with their products.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>here's your reply.</br>  <br>Is this b8?

That was the whole point of Sasuke having a girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Then how in the fuck does he have an eye. It's explicitly stated in the show they can't regrow eyes.</br>  <br>It's also missing Tsunade's brother</br>  <br> Animeonly fags </br>  <br> The fuck does Burrito/Salad have to do with the keikaku meme? <br>see<br><br>Somehow Kishi's bullshit and convoluted family tree places these two at a juncture to reunite the original four clans and give birth to a second Kaguya. The Last was merely step 1.</br></br></br></br>  If you could choose your own stand what would it be?  <br>I've always wanted Killer Queen just because it had cat ears. I just want to touch them.</br>  made in heaven  <br>Cheap Trick</br>  Supa Hot Fire  Foul feats fulfilled at a bargain  <br>Za Warudo or Emperor - both those are baller as fuck</br>  <br>Isn't Emperor essentially just a gun.</br>  <br> Improves user's reflexes and reactions <br> stealth weapon, can summon whenever <br> HOMING. BULLETS. <br>Yeah, but it'll still be a great stand for general life and i wonder if you could ever learn double up and dual wield</br></br></br></br>   not wanting Death 13 <br>do you even lali ho?</br>  <br>I want MILF hunter Kekyoin as my stando</br>  Catch the Rainbow. It wouldn't be the most useful stand, but it'd be the one that would give me the most fun.  I think heaven's door would be awesome because you could just go around reading about peoples lives and shit. Also being able to force people's will by writing rules on them is so powerful.  <br>Uncleanly doings made cheaply</br>  <br><br>Hard to say, but Heaven's Door is fucking OP.</br></br>  Schlong Slinger  Easily Star Platinum<br>Stronk as fuck and I would be able to draw so well I wouldn't need the manga aspect of Heavens Door. Plus time stop and I'm basically set, plus all the plot armor. Second would be Tusk because it just seems like a neat stand</br>  Id need a straight forward powerful one like star platinum or something, im not clever like a jojo character so i couldnt make the weaker ones work. And its important to be blatantly overpowered because stand users being drawn to eachother means id have to encounter some of you faggots.  Mandom.<br><br>There are so many applications of reversing 6 seconds in my life. Cheating the fuck out of RNG is the main one.<br><br>I don't need some bulletproof iron-wrenching punch ghost. I need the ability to undo my mistakes.</br></br></br></br>  Strength.<br><br>I've always wanted a boat.</br></br>  <br>If /a/nons with stands often encountered each other do you think we'd fight? I'm pretty sure we'd just wank to the fact we have stands</br>  <br>That hair looks really out of place, it really looks flat as fuck compared to everything else.</br>  "Razzmatazz"<br>It'd literally be the soul of Frank Sinatra</br>  <br>It'd be the scene where Polnareff and Kakyoin do the secret handshake, only stretched out over our entire meeting.<br><br>I'm absolutely sure you faggots would fight eachother though, just to jerk over the fact that you can. And of course there's be that one guy who had to make everyone his fuckboys.</br></br></br>  <br>i forgot the ability again, freezing raindrops midair and walking on them right?</br>  So who was stronger SP or the world? Dio did punch through SP's attacks but was he just lucky? Yes SP ultimately did kill the world but that's because Dio was already hurt  <br>I'd be friends with you anon. We could fight all the fuck boys together, because be honest, some fighting with your SUTANDO POWA does seem cool. <br>On some basic stuff what would people use their stand the most for? I'd probably  use the stand to get the remote and get me a drink <br><br>Yeah<br><br>They seem about equal, I'd say SP is stronger just due to the compensation for it's range while The World has a much larger range in comparison</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Run the Jewels<br><br>Ability to move at a fast acceleration, hide and store objects</br></br>  <br>I like the reference <br>I'd do King Krule <br>When it hits someone they experience their worst experiences and or feel an extremely heavy drug trip, of course with the ability to weaken said trips</br></br></br>  <br>If I had time stop or whatever, lewd shit, for sure. Or I'd use it to get myself some easy cash and live the good life. I'd basically go full NEET like DIO did.</br>  Heaven's Door or maybe Diver Down they both seem pretty cool. I wouldn't want a combat stand, because it seems really fucking useless.  <br>But anon, that's unjust. I would do the lewd though. Would sign up for those "Strongest man" tv shows and use SP to lift</br>  <br>I'd say what really makes a difference between SP and the world is the users. Dio being a vampire gives him a much longer time stop duration, but I think jotaro's wits makes him and his SP stronger in the end.</br>  <br>It fits well after affect should be insomnia</br>  <br>I was thinking of that, but also an effect on the user from over use would be insomnia.  I want to write a JoJo knock off with all the potential music references I know Araki doesn't listen to. </br>  Crazy Diamond for sure. Just seems to match my personality  <br>a stand who make you poop in your pants until you die of malnutrition.<br><br>I called it The Final Countdown.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably grab Jailhouse Rock, just because it's the stand I personally fear the most by far, and it'd make me feel a lot more comfortable knowing 'I' was the one with control of that stand.<br><br>I'd rather fight Dio 1v1 without a stand of my own (Die.) than face Jailhouse Rock.<br><br>I'd rather die than live the rest of my life with fucking alzheimers.</br></br></br></br></br>  My stand would be called anal cunt. He would show up, shut on the ground, call me gay, then leave  <br>as someone who works with alzheimers patients for research, after all i've seen, if I developed it later on in life I would most likely off myself, because we are not gunna have a cure by the time I'm 60-70</br>  <br>So the spirit and stand of /a/?</br>  <br>I haven't read through it in a while but watching the anime recently It looked like SP did the killing punch on the same spot on The world as where Dio had his legs fucked up moments before. I was assuming it was Dios arrogant personality attacking with his injured body that got him killed.</br>  <br>Yaaaaooooooo, I volunteered at a nursing home for a summer, that's how I learned I'd fucking end my life if I ended up like that too.<br><br>Well, I would if I could even remember that I wanted to die.<br><br>Just gotta make some suicide pacts I guess...<br><br>You know you have a friend when they'll visit you while you're sick. You know you have a best friend when they'll put a bullet in your fucking brain when you won't get better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  you are now imagining all of bizarre adventure being told as a re-cap by some guy with a Brooklyn accent  <br>now listen here u lil shit</br>  So, was Vanilla Ice a true vampire or a zombie? I thought you could only become a vampire via Stone Mask shenanigans, but the people Dio Brando turned into zombies generally looked all grey and weird.  <br>The zombies looked strange and gray, and Vanilla Ice didn't, I mean.</br>  <br><br>It's easy to say this when we have recollection of memory, but as I see it, if you can't remember the horror of the condition, there is no longer any horror to it. Now I don't know how they see it, so my view might be simplistic philosophical bs.</br></br>  <br>Highway Star</br>  <br> once i marry and have children im going to put it in my will </br>  <br><br>it's been a while since I saw the fight but I don't remember vanilla ice regenerating at all during the fight so he might as well have been a zombie right? I get what you mean about the look but I don't think we have enough references other than the abomination zombies to say what they had to look like.</br></br>  <br> If you could choose your own stand what would it be? <br><br>A gay one.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why the condition creeps me out so much on a deep existential level.<br><br><br> Good idea, I'll do the same. Fuck that noise. </br></br></br></br>  <br>done</br>  Floral Shoppe<br><br>Power E<br>Precision D<br>Speed C<br>Range C<br>Durability C<br>Potential B<br><br>The stand itself manifests itself as a pink fog that can quickly surround objects.<br><br>Objects covered in the gas cannot exert a presence on anything outside its range. For example, covering a police car in the fog means that people won't be able to see or hear it or the noise the sirens make and a person walking into the fog will simply pass the car and end up on the other side.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And breaking your body down to follow raindrops, like he did by sending his jaw down with a drop and biting Johnny's shoulder IIRC.</br>  "Teen Spirit"<br><br>My stand would have a ghost like physical appearance and my powers only work on people the ages of 13-19. My "teen spirit" stand has the ability to poses any teenagers body and take over full control of their consciousness.<br><br> I will only use this stand to do lewd stuff with teenage girls. This stand will most likely not be suitable for combat situations unless I'm fighting another stand user who is in the teenage age bracket and then I could just command them to kill themselves. </br></br></br></br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>As a philosophy  minor  it doesn't scare me within my perspective, however if I do know of my condition and could remember how I can't remember shit then yeah, I'll probably be inclined to do something rash. I might as well put it in my will too, thanks for thought to.</br>  <br>that feels like a stand that would be overpowered if araki put it in the series.</br>  <br>Should be called Smells like Teen Spirit.  The aftereffect of the stand is that if used for too long the teenager has an increase in suicidal thought, so if used for stuff like interrogation you'd have to time it wisely and not over use it. Also since it is "teen spirit" maybe if said teenager has a stand you can make use of their stand as well </br>  <br>Lol, Philosophy. What a waste of college money, why don't you get a real degree like  Sociology with a minor in Anthropology, for the love of God end my life plz. </br>  <br> I'm majoring in Anthropology mate, I just plan on doing med school after </br>  <br>In my country you can apply for self-termination. Just fill in the paperwork and pick out a date and a doctor will be dispatched to your location with a syringe.<br>No need to wait for a slow, agonizing death. Time is money wasted.</br></br>  I was re-watching a few episodes of stardust crusaders and for all the crap ive heard about part 3 no one ever talks about the 4th wall being broken during wheel of fortune. <br>this scene made me laugh so hard. too bad this is probably the only instance of it in part 3 or any other part.</br>  <br>If you can choose then why not choose the most broken Stand?</br>  <br>That isn't Heaven's Door or Hey Ya.</br>  <br>I don't know anon, Gold exerience requiem is pretty bullshit. I mean I know the translation for part 5 is ass, but from what I could tell it basically negated king crimsons power and said "fuck you" over and over again.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool dude. I thought about going into forensic anthropology so I could be a fucking coroner (People keep telling me that's creepy as fuck, but I just remember being fascinated when I dissected shit back in the day.), but I'm starting to think I'll just do some social work and then go into law later.<br><br>That, or maybe join the army as an officer and try to get a civil affairs position where I can oversee our relations with some foreign country somewhere. I got a 97 on my ASVAB (A 96 is required.), so that means I can definitely do it.<br><br>I wanna hold off on making those decisions until later on though, for now I'm happy being a broke college student fucking around on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br>  Expectations for EoH? After seeing N'Doul play out, I'm hoping for more gimmicky characters like Mountain Tim.  <br>fuck man N'doul is gonna b everyones partner come full game hes just the best support</br>  C-moon. <br>It would be cool to be able to float around and if I feel like it I could go to Florida and reset the universe in whatever way I want.</br>  <br> Time in a bottle <br><br>The ability to reverse time by 30 seconds with only its effects being known to the user. I would only use it for gambling (Roulette/Craps) and wouldn't bother doing stand fights or anything badass. Just doing some gambling to make enough money to live the way that I want to.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just a stronger Mandom.</br>  <br> I want Ringo Roadagain's stand Mandom except better in every way. <br>There's gotta be a downside Anon, like you have to age a month every time you do it, and it makes your hair and fingernails grow a month too.</br></br>  Pet shop's stand.  <br>me too dude</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty crappy stand, not gonna lie.<br><br>Iggy managed to beat it, and his stand was probably worse than Hermit Purple.</br></br></br>  King Crimsom would be the best for trolling.  <br>  worse than Hermit Purple <br><br>It can create sand clones, help you glide, etc.</br></br></br>  Probably a stand capable of physical recomposing or rearrangement like Sticky Fingers, Soft Machine, or Metallica. <br><br>Part V the bes.</br></br>  I'd like to have Metallica to fuck people up big time.  <br> worse that purple hermit  <br>Negroe please.</br></br>  Mandom.<br><br>Because fuck you</br></br>  <br>Hermit Purple's not great in Stand terms, but it's probably the best Stand a Ripple user could ask for. An extendable Ripple conduit that can bind enemies, pull you around like a grappling hook for mobility, wrap around you like armor for defense, and can even find your enemies for you or create maps.</br>  <br>this is why joseph had it.</br>  I want D4C so I can have anal myself.   mandom <br><br> the world <br><br> king crimson <br><br>any one of those will do, really</br></br></br></br></br></br>  No wait, Chocolate Disco. Super useful.  <br> can have </br>  <br><br>Once DIO is gone Joseph's stand gives him nigh omniscience as long as he looks in the right places. Plus it has long range and he can channel a ripple through it.<br><br>Iggy can float around and make sand bullshit. Sure he might be able to beat Joseph up, but it's only just slightly better at actually fighting.<br><br>Saying Iggy's is better because it's slightly better in a fight is like saying a spider is slightly stronger than an ant.<br><br>Not exactly a selling point, and Joseph's is still crazy better outside of combat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any time based Stand would be great</br>  The Ensemble of Shadows.<br><br>A stand similar to Star Platinum but made out of fog emanating a dark aura that automatically rots everything it touches or takes out the evil in one´s heart if they breath the air it rots.<br>Can also be used as a protective barrier and can solidify itself to fight or lift heavy things if needed but not as physically strong or fast as Star Platinum.</br></br></br>  <br>That stand is nothing like Star Platinum.<br><br>Why did you even mention Star Platinum? It served no purpose in describing your stand.<br><br>Also that stand sounds extremely edgy in that special "bad guy from kingdom hearts" kind of way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so all it can really do is lift things thats fucken gay</br>  <br>That stand is gayer than gay priest.</br>  <br>I meant like Star Platinum in the sense it has a form and literally stands behind me and that also has short range. Something like that.<br><br>And it´s more based in that bitch from Medaka Box that could rot everything she touches</br></br></br>  <br>Same for me, definitely Heaven's Door. It might not seem like the most powerful compared to ridiculous stands like The World, and King Crimson. But being able to write in rules would be the best.</br>  Alright, if I had a shitty fanfiction stand:<br> Revolution <br>Stand itself is short range punch ghost with 4 arms that spin around it.<br><br>Whatever it touches will revolve around on an orbit (Or simply rotate in place), the trajectory and speed of which is decided by how hard the stand slaps it.<br><br>The objects will revolve around me as if I were the 'sun' in a galaxy.<br><br>The orbit may be elliptical or whatever.<br><br>Not exactly great, but the stand itself would make for a pretty good asskicker and the ability itself does have some creative applications (I can make the wheels of my car spin without needing gas.) and at the very least it can be used to fling shit at people.<br><br> Revolution Number 9 <br>The evolved form for when I need to fight Diavolo. This form has has the ability to... I don't really know, I can't really think of anything original that's fucking OP without ripping off of C-Moon.<br><br>Obviously something to do with gravity though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Challenge for the thread:<br><br> Take two Stands which share one word of their names (Hermit Purple and Purple Haze, for example) and combine them and their powers into something new, then rename them. <br><br>That's it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like it. And there are a lot if gravity based stands anyway. C-moon just has most of their basic powers.</br>  <br>Highway Star Platinum<br><br>It's a remote Star Platinum that moves at 60km/h and kicks well<br> Am I doing this right? </br></br></br></br>  <br>C-Snake<br>Can steal the gravity from a object In the shape of a disc add that gravity to something else by inserting the disc.</br></br>  <br>Mine would be this:<br><br> 「Crazy La Paint」 <br><br>Power: B<br>Speed: B<br>Range: C<br>Staying: D<br>Precision: A<br>Potential: B<br><br>「Crazy La Paint」 appears as a vaguely humanoid entity, only just fitting the bill due to standing upright most of the time, though its build suggests that this would not be a natural pose in a real creature. Further de-anthropomorphising it is the fact that its entire body is composed of specific musical instruments - each limb is represented by an old-fashioned accordion, whilst its body, shoulders, and limb extremities are all composed of drums of various types, with the two shoulder pads also possessing piston-like devices that beat the two drums sequentially in a steady pattern; its fingers are flexible keys from a xylophone- or glockenspiel-like instrument, and its head is essentially a miniature pipe organ, like a scaled-down version of something one would see in a church moulded to form around the drum body, with the holes in the pipes acting as eyes.<br><br>「Crazy La Paint」 possesses the ability to induce "spin" in a target, represented by one of its limbs winding itself into a spiral for as long as needed, with stronger spin needing more wind-up time, then hitting a target to release that twisting into the target. Said spin can be utilised on both physical targets, either twisting the target's form up to and past the point at which the target breaks from the torsion or physically forcing them to start spinning round in a given plane of rotation at speed proportionate to wind-up, and on abstract or otherwise nonsensical concepts, for instance "twisting" a target's words to sound more convincing or "spinning" a literal web out of thin air as a spider would. Naturally, this has a lot of significant uses, but being made of constantly-sounding instruments makes stealth with this Stand totally impossible unless it is desummoned completely, which may hinder the user to a significant extent in many situations for one reason or another.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Shiieet I'm just beginning SBR, sorry I'm a hack guys.</br></br></br>  <br> Highway Star and Highway to Hell <br><br>This is an automatic stand that activates when the user dies. The stand pursues the target any distance in an attempt to kill the target in the same manner that the stand user died in. In doing so the user comes back to life if done within 24 hours. <br><br>Name? Sympathy for the Devil.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes<br><br>Close, but no Cigar.</br></br></br>  <br>Love it<br><br>I would have gone with C-Moon and Dark Blue Moon if I'm honest.</br></br></br>  <br> dark blue moon and C-moon <br>Basically a nerfed C-moon</br></br>  <br> Heirophant Green and Green Green Grass Of Home <br><br>This Stand is capable of unfurling itself into Tendrils that subject those pieced by them to Xenos paradox the further into the body the tendril penetrates. Its name is Savage Garden.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shifty Stunts for Scant Shekels</br></br>  <br>So combing Dark Blue Moon with either C-Moon or Moody Blues nerfs the latter two horribly.</br>  <br>Stealing that for a JoJo RPG I'm running. Gonna be quite the shock for the players when this seemingly ordinary guy challenges them and actively tries to get himself killed by them.</br>  <br> Boy II Man and Mandom <br>Standard Boy II Man RPS game except instead of stealing power the winner takes time (life) from the loser. Maybe a week of their life or more and there is no limit to how many games it can play.<br>As for a name, 「I'D DIE FOR YOU」</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit that'd be a cool villain Stand.</br>  <br>The Lock+Jail House Lock would be terrifying though, wouldn't it?</br>  <br>sounds cool</br>  <br> Red Hot Magician <br>I'm fucking Cole Macgrath that has Storm Spirit for a stand. How fucking awesome is that?</br></br>  <br>Bretty rad</br>  <br> Green grass of home and green day. <br>A green and black humanoid stand with long black hair. The closer a living thing gets mold when begin to grow on their bodies and will rot them away until they distance themselves.<br>When punched by the stand they will be instantly reduced to nothing <br> Beautiful World </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck..how would work.</br>  <br>Yeah go for it, the way I wrote it the user didn't necessarily have to be killed by the target but the closer they are the faster the stand would be able to pursue since it's on a clock. I imagined the user getting run over by a car then having the stand attempt to kill the target in a similar fashion.</br>  <br> Dirt Cheap Trick <br><br>Cheap Trick but with D4C dimension hopping.</br></br></br>  My stand would be one that manipulates time and simply removes moments of when my opponent or me did something, removing my mistakes or getting rid of my enemy's correct judgement. It will also be able to put scenarios that have made up in certain time slots in the past or future...Is tht too OP?  <br>*That I have made up</br>  My stand would be Crawling Skin. <br><br>Its would be some sort of horrible wormlike creature that burrowed underneath the flesh of its victims and drove them to screaming insanity.</br></br>  <br>Bloody hell<br> Cream and Cream Starter <br>Piranha manifests as a Spray can with what appears to be swimming fish on the sides, when the nozzle is squeezed it releases a stream of bruise-colored flesh-foam that will move to the largest piece of Organic material and begin consuming it and growing larger, Typically this flesh-foam will cling to surfaces without moving, but it can form its mass into limbs to pull consumables in.</br></br></br>  <br>You start having a Guilt Trip and can't remember why, which makes you guilty, you can see the end of this path, can't you?</br>  <br>There's no coming back from that. That's terrifying.</br>  <br>"tap that"<br><br>I get to read the mind of anyone I touch.</br></br></br>  <br>You have good taste. Crazy Diamond is easily the best Stand.</br>  <br>It's my favorite as far as design goes. It's a nice straight forward stand that takes some cleverness to master. Like I said I think it'd work well with how I am.</br>  <br>Hell, it's worse than the fusion of Lovers and Love Deluxe I came up with. And that is Strands of hair that detach from their users body, burrow into someone and replicate along their nervous system, and take control of them by firing off all of their pain receptors at once if they don't listen to the User.<br><br>Jojolion gave use a hell of a lot of combos for KC, didn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>Underhanded Undertakings for Unsatisfactory Wages</br>  <br>Shame train<br><br>The closer someone gets to me the fatter, uglier and bald(er) he gets. At punching range people would be unable to stand(hue). Being in the stands range causes the effect to slowly accumulate Has no further effects and can't attack at all. Yes this aplies to everyone: men, women, children, friend, foe, stands and even animals. <br><br> Always active <br><br> IRREVERSIBLE. <br><br> RANGE: S+ <br><br> Killing me makes the stand jump to the killer </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Weather Report<br>I can literally do anything</br></br>  <br>Does it just work?</br>  <br>you just described King Crimson.</br>  Drawn to the Blood, a punch ghost that lets me see vital things like runner vision.

That sounds like a huge pain, and seems like it would be the exact opposite of my dream stand:<br><br> 「Shut Up and Let Me Go」 <br><br>Power: E<br>Speed: E<br>Range: A<br>Staying: B<br>Precision: C<br>Potential: C<br><br>Physically it would be similar to Hey Ya, in that it would be small enough to ride on my shoulders. It would have bubble-wand holes through its palms to create bubbles. It can then attach these bubbles to things, through which no sound can enter or leave. For example surrounding the following would have these effects. <br><br>People's mouths = they become mute but can't hear<br>People's heads = They can only hear their own voices, but no one can hear theirs<br>People's ears = They become deaf, but others can still hear them<br>Headphone buds = Perfect soundproof headphones<br>Feet = Silent footsteps<br>Rooms = perfect for private conversations or quiet TV watching at 3 AM</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  「Gangsta's Paradise」<br>Anyone the user attacks is cursed with life-destroying bad luck.<br><br>You fuck with me, I fuck you up forever.</br></br></br>  <br>That moment when your death is Kars except banished into a world with no sound</br>  <br>Have it look like it's composed entirely of Jewelry, and the cursed person has this Jewelry affixed to them.</br>  <br>Top fucking taste in music</br>   Soft Machine+Soft &amp; Wet <br>There is no way this wont be horrifying.</br>  Are there any references to Japanese music in JoJo or is it Western only?  <br>Magenta Magenta and Wekapipo are the first references to it for a band araki did the art for.</br>  Hey Ya! Literally perfect luck, can't go wrong with that. Speaking of Hey Ya!, Pocoloco could beat every JoJo villain singlehandedly couldn't he?<br><br>Also that one Part 7 bomb Stand with the timers had a Japanese name</br></br>  <br> get friends into JoJo <br> 2 of them read the manga all the way through, we play ASB together, considering importing EoH so we can play together <br> other 2 are animeonlies who circlejerk about Part 3 and are making up fanfiction and OC Stands based around their circle of friends <br>It was going so good with my first 2 pals too.</br></br></br></br>  「Eazy-E」<br>gives people AIDS</br>  <br><br>Chocolate Disco from part 7 as well</br></br>    <br>Yeah, but the name itself is a translation of the lyrics from Oye Como Va.</br>  <br>That guy on the left looks so pissed that Araki doesn't listen to glorious nipon beats</br>  <br>Huh, the more you know</br>  Stand Name: Turbo Killer<br><br>Stand Ability: [Speed Combat](http://powerlisting.wikia.c<wbr>om/wiki/Speed_Combat)<br><br>Power - C<br><br>Speed - A<br><br>Range - C<br><br>Durability - A<br><br>Precision - A<br><br>Potential - C<br><br>Description: The ability to infuse speed with physical combat. Variation of Combat Merging. User is able to fight at incredible speed, striking their opponent in rapid succession that may even kill opponents instantly. Their attacks may cause more damage than normal due to gaining kinetic energy, and thus momentum, produced through the speed of each hit. If the speed is fast enough, it can distort space to bypass defenses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  I think my stand would be something like this.<br> Eyes Without A Face <br>It has the ability to read a person´s mind and see what they´re seeing, If a person is not paying attention to what they´re thinking I can implant thoughts and suggestions. It´s not strong in terms of strength but has a long range of effectiveness.</br></br>  <br>Also<br>http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~dft29/<wbr>Stand_Generator/Stand-Generation-Ov<wbr>erdrive.html</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Sounds nice but too broken.<br>Maybe people could break the jewelry on them to erase their curse. Maybe its user could try to bait people by laying the jewelry in the middle of the street and curse them for being greedy bastards and picking it up.<br><br>The bad luck could be minor with just one piece, but the stand itself can attach more through physical contact to increase the bad luck effect. If the user is defeated, all pieces disappear since they're not real but made from a stand.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe its user could try to bait people <br>It's shitposter-kun's Stand then</br></br>  Stand Name: Freewheel Burning<br><br>Stand Ability: [Solar Attacks](http://powerlisting.wikia.<wbr>com/wiki/Solar_Attacks)<br><br>Power - C<br><br>Speed - A<br><br>Range - C<br><br>Durability - B<br><br>Precision - B<br><br>Potential - E<br><br>Not sure what to make of this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Careless Whisper<br><br>Everything I say goes, from commands to seduction. <br><br>Obvious weakness is that if you can't hear me, it won't affect you. <br><br>My stand is a silver saxophone, if I can play a tune consisting of more than 6 notes I can make myself nut.

Alright.<br><br>"Crystal Japan": can make diamonds on victim's skin that hurt on contact, allowing to prevent it running away or getting closer by covering feet. Can also cover with diamonds its user to shield from an attack, but that would also hurt him in the process. Another possible use is to grow diamonds on user's arm to use as melee weapon.  Maybe for evolution can grow diamonds on the inside and kill, but that's OP. <br><br>"Ashes to ashes": a physical revolver, bullets from which teleport the user to the place where the bullet stopped. The bullets themselves aren't physical, and disappear upon the teleportation. Not much by itself, but can lead to interesting scenarios.<br> investigation of possibly stand-related locked room murders with strange wall destructions or extremely gory bodies without a fitting murder weapon <br> when retrieved from a user and shot at him missing/wounding him teleports from a fight <br> user can confuse the pursuers by firing several bullets in different directions (teleporting to each stopped bullet, eventually to the last one) <br> if bullet stuck in a body victim has to immediately move and try to remove the bullet without stopping or else teleport kill <br> can get on some glider, shoot straight above and fuck off far away if held out from attackers enough for bullet to stop mid-air </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You think instead of making it blow up, EoH will have the road roller stay on the stage after DIO uses it?  <br>people would start murdering real quick if we had stands</br>  <br>Killer Queen is kawaii and Kira was my favorite villian so KQ.</br>  <br>What if you encounter a person who is ashamed of his own power?</br>  The Sun, because it is a fucking giant fireball. You would never overcome this.  Rite Where You Stand  Reference to Gang Starr <br>The user has to stay still but when they do their stand emerges from below the enemy and is similar to the hands in Morioh, so just a shit ton of hands reaching for the enemy. The more stands you defeat, not necessarily kill, you get another set of hands</br>  <br>1 trillion lions can</br>  Alright, how much do you guys think the blu-ray releases will fix DIOs world? the last episode was great, but there was a lot of terrible animation especially after the knife throwing part and the cab.<br><br>Looking back at it I'm really dissapointed it looked so shitty at times, I really wanted this part to look fucking amazing. The steamroller did for sure, but fuck man. I really do hope shit is fixed in the blu-rays.</br></br>  <br>How often do they try to impress you with their knowledge of memes?</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br>Specials is probably the coolest stand in that game on top of being pretty good gameplay-wise.<br><br>Nothing like snarky secret agent bodyguards backing you up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. The scene where they first showed his face at the stairs was amazing, got me really pumped for the whole arc. <br><br>Then it looked like ass 70% of the time.</br></br></br>  <br>Doubt it.</br>  <br>Star Platinum is the coolest.</br>  <br>I just realized DIO was full NEET</br>  <br>Actually after reading the Stand list I'd probably pick Pearl Jam. I'm not a combative person at all and it'd make me practically immortal.<br><br>Anyway since we're posting mary sue Stands I'll just copypaste the one I posted yesterday:<br><br>Blur<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SSb<wbr>BvKaM6sk</wbr>  [ ]<br>Merges two people (can only be done once with one pair but can be done with several people, so you can't make recursive combinations). The only actions the combined pair can take are those both people agree on.

Did no one read the manga? The dude's twin brother got hanged by the KKK for being black and kissing a white girl in the South. (Even tho Weather passes for white easily.) Of course the dude is black, a fucking degenerate shitbag southerner able to figure out that Weather was black with a little research. How would Weather's much darker twin brother not be black?  <br>NOBODY PANIC!</br>  Is the translation out?  <br>Read the FUCKING manga<br><br>Weather and Enrico Pucci are twins from the Pucci family, which has two white parents. But at the time of weather's lynching, only Pucci knew that they were twins. They KKK thought that Weather's parents were the woman that swiped Weather at birth and her black husband. Weather doesn't actually have any black genes.</br></br></br>  <br>They just got the raws today.</br>  <br><br> This, but also his family is explicitly Italian.

If they do not accept the banana, be it through refusing them or attempting to ignore banana man, they will begin to hallucinate bananas. During their hallucination they will slowly grow more detached from reality, and anything that cannot be turned into bananas will still gain a banana theme to it. The effect escalates and continues until the banana is accepted.<br><br>Secondary Ability: Should the banana be accepted, Banana Man can grow bananas out of itself. Banana Man’s bananas are special as they are even healthier than normal bananas, are always at the recipients ideal level of ripeness, and are incredibly filling. Because of this, Banana Man can double as a healing effect, though not as directly as the user may hope<br><br>Weakness: Banana Man can be hard to control, as it is wholly sentient and has a personality of its own. While a naturally good person, Banana Man has difficulties focusing on things. It will also sometimes forget that normal people can’t see stands, and its user must help non-stand users escape the hallucinations. Banana Man also cannot differentiate friend from foe without the help of its user, and has a chance of accidentally healing villainous types with its bananas.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Za Warudo<br><br>So I can be a raging faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>But anon,  you already are one!

It kind of irked me that the didn't have any actual tongue interwining and they were just touching the tips with their mouths on each other the first time. <br><br>Tongue related stuff is my fetish so I'm very happy with this.</br></br></br>  <br> That saliva trail <br><br>Jesus holy fuck</br></br></br>  <br>My dick</br>  <br>My lord what a way to start off the season.<br>And the fucking first episode hasn't even aired yet.<br><br> We're literally going to have three different webms circulating all over the board now. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't this an OVA?<br>Why did it had smoke censorship?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember nipples aside from that promart.</br>  <br>Sweet Jesus.</br>  <br>I don't think anything will beat this.<br>It's too lewd for TV.</br></br>  <br> three different webms of mouth rape <br> all of them are going to get spammed all over 4chan again <br><br>Hot damn.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So this is what a well animated hentai look like.</br>  <br>Because shitty apologetic low fanservice.<br>It only has bath nudity and kiss which are Ghibli level and just a kiss respectively.<br><br> kiss <br> lewd <br>Fucking prudes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When will hentai have this quality?</br>  <br>Well what are you waiting for.

Prisma Illya staff confirmed for good taste.</br></br>  <br>Did you even watch the webm?<br>Both were completely nude, pressing their bodies at each other while kissing with tongue action and glorious voice acting that seemed like if they were orgasming.<br>It's fucking hot.</br></br></br>  <br>It was ok.</br>  <br>HOLY FUCKING SHIT MY DICK <br>THIS MAKES ME HARDER THAN MAZINKAISER.

I love it.</br></br></br>  <br>This is better than the 95% of anime hentai.</br>  <br><br> extremely lewd kiss <br> pingpong  <br>SL confirmed for bros.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, is this still not out yet?</br>  <br> not reading the thread </br>  <br>Damn I missed Ruby</br>  <br>What does Miyu expressions try to convey?</br>  So can anyone confirm if this girls are actually gay for each other? I see them making out and shit, but in a heart beat they'll drop down for Shirou like there is no tomorrow.<br><br>Are they just pretending to be gay or something?</br></br>  <br>Why are these girls so gay?</br>  <br>The same feeling as Illya back in the day.</br>  dat ahegao tho  <br>Kuro needs mana to live<br>Mana transfers are done via sharing bodily fluids, thus the kisses. <br>Prismaverse Shirou's just a joke minor character anyway (The joke being every girl (and Issei) falling for him because of his status as the MC of a porn game)</br></br></br>  <br>I completely agree with this statement.</br>  <br>Only Mimi is gay</br>  <br>So all of the girls are actually straight then. Miyu, Illya and Kuro are all gunning for Shirou in actuality.</br>  <br> nipple on nipple <br> grinding <br><br>Christ Almighty. <br>I'm going to need four rosaries for this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if the kissing thing is canon, haven't seen it anywhere else outside of Prisma.<br>But on the other hand Illya can't exactly cum inside Kuro.</br></br>  <br>Why would anyone go that far to pretend to be gay?<br><br><br>Miyu is pretty gay too.<br><br><br>All of the girls except Miyu have a crush on Shirou, but it's pretty obvious they're in enjoying the mana trasnfers thoroughly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Miyu is straight for her onii-chan as she shown.</br>  <br>No confirmation<br>You could have point for Kuro (Then again, she seems to be after anything that moves) and Illya<br>But Miyu? I don't think so.</br></br></br>  <br>Where has she shown she wants Shirou?</br>  <br>Pretty sure she's straight for Shirou as shown by her actions in her own world as well as her sadness in the fluffy Shirou world.</br>  <br>There is no evidence to suggest that she is gay though, she's shown more passionate affection for her world's Shirou.</br>  <br>Pure delusions. She was worried about the guy because he let her run away to another world. So she didn't know what kind of punishment the Ainsworth were giving him for doing that</br>  <br>The anime adaptation push far more heavily the yuri undertone, especially Miyu behavior toward Illya. Pretty much every scenes exposing potentials feelings are treated with humours anyways, both in the manga and anime. Just don't take it seriously. <br>  anon, they're just fucking bi  </br></br>  <br>Transfer of any bodily fluids also transfers prana. Semen just happens to have the most in it.</br>  <br/>  <br> No, she hasn't. She was just worried about the guy because god knows what the Ainsworth were doing to him for letting her run away<br>And then, the dude got heavily wounded.during the battle against Julian<br>She's currently happy that after all that, the dude is more or less fine</br></br></br>  <br>She's just a little sister for Shirou, not in love with him. Nothing has shown it to be more than family love.</br>  <br>The denial dude is the one saying Miyu wants Shirou. Can't we have a sister who simply loves her brother without any incestuous feelings in the mix for once? Why can't her love be purely familial? Why must tthere be incestuous feelings?</br>  <br><br>They're all straight.</br></br>  <br>The only proof is Shirou, and that's treated as a joke anyway. And nothing shows Miyu even has incestuous feelings towards him</br>  <br>Tell that to the hot and gay kisses posted in this thread.</br>  <br>There can't be rape between two lolis.</br>  <br> The only proof is Shirou, and that's treated as a joke anyway. <br> Miya Shirou <br> Joke character <br>I don't think you know what you're talking about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's all circumstantial for the sake of Mana transfer, remove that retarded plotline and nobody would kissing anyone.</br>  <br>Clearly enjoyed it.</br>  <br>Miyu is so obviously gay for Illya I'm surprised people like you exist.</br>  <br>You know I was talking about the one from the Prismaverse. <br>Illya and Kuro have no feelings for miyuverse's Shrou himself, other than gratitude for helping in the battle against Julian. They have both accepted by now that he's a different person</br></br>  <br>No, not really. The Onii-chan is real.</br>  <br>Beautiful.<br><br>Looks like that's the new webm to circulate.</br></br></br>  <br>Miyu is straight for Alternate Universe Shirou<br>Illya and Kuro and straight for Prisma Shirou<br>Pretty straight forward anon.</br></br></br>  <br>If you remove the mana transfer in the VN, nobody has sex with anyone.<br>Does that means they aren't straight?<br><br>Also, the only forced kiss was first Miyu kiss, after that they seem to enjoy the kissing.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The harem MC is the natural enemy of the yurifags: they know any sexual tension between the girls shift to real rivalry when that guy arrives to the scene.</br></br>  <br>Why do they kiss?</br>  <br> Illya and Kuro do this god knows how many times every week <br>What is life?</br></br>  <br>But remove the sex scenes from the VN and there is still undisputable romantic declarations of love. Key difference anon.</br>  <br>Fuck off, hetshitter<br>Stop twisting Miyu's family love for her brother into incest just because of your retarded anti yuri crusade<br>Can't we have a little sister who loves her brother without incest rearing it's ugly head for once?</br></br></br>  <br> Miyu is straight for Alternate Universe Shirou <br>Delusional, she only wants IIya's stick</br></br>  <br>You can remove the yuri goggles at any moment now, i'll wait.</br>  <br>Okay.<br>So, the Prisma girls can enjoy sexual activities with other girls, but will not develop romantic feelings with any woman.<br>I think we can agree on that.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not about yuri googles anymore, retard<br>It's about you not understanding a little sister can love her big brother without wanting to fuck him<br>It's about me wanting to see some family love in anime and manga without fucking incest rearing it's fucking ugly head</br></br></br>  <br> she only wants <br>See this is actually delusion, you going to ignore how much she wanted to her Shirou for? How much it hurt her every time she saw Prisma Shirou?<br>You can argue it's both, but just Illya? Now that's delusion.</br></br></br>  <br>Not every interaction familiar is about incest, you sick fuck</br>  <br>Stop forcing incest. She was just worried about the last living member of her family because the Ainsworth could have been torturing him or worse.<br> A girl is worried about her brother because he could be being tortured <br> That means she wants to fuck him <br>retarded logic</br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently Kiritsugu said he was going to use Miyu to save the world? Using her as the grail. Probably adopted them just for that reason here.<br><br>We can only guess who might be the first one Shirou has to get rid of in order to protect his real family now.</br></br></br>  <br>There aren't enough "muh dick"s in the world for this.</br>  <br> Dat Miyu wanting more after Kuro tease her </br>  <br>What's with this shit quality friend?</br>  This is definitely more than Yuri undertones, this is pure, high grade, Yuri concentrate  <br>My penis is happy</br>  <br>It doesn't necessarily have to be insest for it to be straight. The point is she's straight.</br>  So is this yuri or just subtext?  <br>No, rhe point is that you're fucking delusional, bub.</br>  I can't believe it. They actually just topped Sakura Trick's kiss service.  <br>The only proof you're using for her to be straight is Shirou, and that would be forcing incest where it's not fucking needed, only for the sake of a retarded crusade against yuri</br>  <br>I need to visit my local church after this. Hot as fuck.</br>  <br>HOLY LOLY</br>  <br>Subtext and a god amount of kissing, but I could see the author making it happen if he really wanted to.</br>  <br> forcing incest where it's not fucking needed <br>It is needed you fucking faggot.</br></br>  <br><br>Why is this allowed?<br><br>Why isn't the Japanese government doing something about this?</br></br></br></br>  <br> nude <br>Bath scene, doesn't matter.<br>And kissing is just kissing. It was shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut the hell up, nobody cares about the shitty opinion of your dick.</br>  <br> That Grial-kun prize <br>I lost it.</br></br>  <br>Nether does any care about your opinion. Yuri is only acceptable as fanservice. Girls are made to like cock, but I guess a brain damaged dyke like you can't understand such a simple fact.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/jiRdixLq38o  [ ]  <br>How? For your retarded crusade against Yuri? <br>Incest is absolutely unnecesary for the plot. Miyu's love for Shirou is pure family love</br></br>  <br>This.

Why does this trash take so long to make it to TV this season anyway?

Isn't that something you're supposed to do though?</br>  <br>Yes but drawing from imagination is a lot harder if you want to make natural poses. <br>Having a refrence to go by makes it a lot easier.</br></br>  Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray).<br>It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling.<br>Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.</br></br>  <br>Hey, In the last thread I was told to check in tomorrow which is today so... how's the request with Lum and that Pontiac coming along?</br>  <br>Well, "today" isn't over is it?</br>  <br>OKAY, okay, sorry if I'm being impatient.

How did it do, sales-wise? Be it BDs or goodies.  I did my part   <br> How did it do, sales-wise <br>Absolutely average.</br></br>  <br>This picture will probably be better if it's F/8 instead of F/2</br>  <br>Yeah I made a mistake with this one, but whatever. Here's another one I posted yesterday.<br><br><br>Now I'm sad</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's all about the tourism and whether Kokona's VA wants to fund another season anyway.</br>  <br>Which mountain is this?</br>  <br>French Alps, Vanoise massif</br>  <br>I want to commit a heinous crime</br>  I want to tear her seams.  <br><br>How can she be so pure and so lewd at the same time?

Japan's national parks and Saitama prefecture paid for this, if they got a good return its should get more episodes.  Those stockings are cute as fuck. I should really watch S2 of this.    <br>The manga's publisher said they want to make more seasons, a thread a while ago posted the tweets</br>          <br>That's some intense hardcore mountain climbing.</br>  <br>RIP, anon.</br>  How many people here have tried to hike up a hill or mountain after watching this show?  <br>It made me want to do more outdoorsy things in general.<br><br>Not a lot of hills or mountains around me. A few hiking places are, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Posts like these are not accepted in a tibetan mountain climbing board such as /a/.</br>  <br>it was the greatest day of my life, anon</br>  <br>i climbed Mt. Takao when i went to japan, went the opposite route they did though</br>  <br>why would you go any other route?</br>  <br>b/c the route they went up (route 1 i think) is nothing but walking up super steep roads until you hit the top</br>  <br>nawww, its only super steep half the way. once you get to the top cable car station it flattens out considerably. still a few stairs to get to the temples, but they are nothing after doing that god forsaken slope. theres also checkpoint signs showing facts about the mountain/wildlife as you go up.</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>i went down route 1, but went up the nature path</br>  <br>Finally did it <br><br>Other than this small clearing showing the land below, that's all there is to this hill, with the small hiking trail eventually leading to a sealed off water supply tank at the top. <br><br>And no sightings of mountain lolis either. Maybe on the climb?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good job, anon.</br>  <br>Only mountain grandmothers here.</br>  <br><br>Where do you live?</br></br>  <br>I would love them to do that on either side of the head of my climbing pole.</br>  <br>Asian country, Malaysia</br>  Why was this show so good? The direction was way above typical moe SoL.  <br>Motivational to explore the world</br>  <br>That sounds an awful lot like you're wanting their dismembered heads on your pole.</br>  Yama no Susume doesn't need BD sales to get another season, it needs more people buying mountain gear since it's literally an advertainment show. Or did you guys miss all the product placement?  Remember the white piggu characters from the Fuji arc? Baiting people like that is exactly what the show is about.   nothing can fill the void after finishing season 2   <br>Climb a mountain and relive the series</br>  <br>Everyone needs to go to Takao and buy flying squirrel keychains and eat fried dango.</br>  <br>But I'm sure buying the BDs directly gives more chance of another season rather than randomly buying expensive mountain gears. And I don't have anyone else to bring along hiking either</br>  <br>The anime is exact 1:1 reproduction of the manga right?</br>  I need to see more pictures of anons at the mountains.  <br>No, not at all. The original manga is actually science fiction, Aoi and Hinata were raised on a space station and visit different planets to mountain climb. Kaede was a half-alien with blue skin.</br>  <br>From which unfathomable dimension is this tentacled terror of the abyss from?</br>  <br> heinous crime <br>By that do you mean  head-patting  her or  admiring  her in a swimsuit?</br></br>  <br>No, there were filler episodes and for some reason the anime reduced Aoi's father's screentime, you barely even remember he was there.</br>  3rd season when?  <br>So how many orphans are there in this show?</br>  <br>I want to marry her lonely mother and therefore legalise me doing this to her</br>  <br>If another one year passed after this and no more news about YnS is released, then I'm afraid the dream is all over.</br>  <br>No one. Aoi has both parents, Hinata has her dad, Kokona has her mom, and you can assume Kaede's parents are just working in another place like how most anime parents are.</br>  <br>So two half orphans, and Kaede is almost an adult herself. Their houses are really huge however, and I don't see/remember them having siblings</br>  <br> how most anime parents are <br>I assume this isn't an accurate portrayal of an average urban Japanese residence?</br></br>    <br> Their houses are really huge however <br>Except Kokona's house. Hinata's house was based on a real library in Hanno and it is huge for for a normal Japanese household. I don't know if Aoi's or Kaede's house is based on a real house.<br><br> and I don't see/remember them having siblings <br>For some reason most of the characters are single child, I don't know why.<br><br><br> I assume this isn't an accurate portrayal of an average urban Japanese residence? <br>It isn't, kids stay with their parents until high school usually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Only three people lives in this castle.  This is how she gets extra spending money  <br>12 years old.<br>Or something like that.</br></br>  <br>If I remembered she's just a year older than the main pair, and they're probably 13-14 y/o.</br>  Commencing short profile dump          <br>What's that last line indicating? That's the only one I can't infer</br>    <br><br><br><br>Why is Coconut facing to the left?</br></br></br></br>  <br>花言葉？Language of the flowers?</br>  <br>It's strange to see that she has the exact same sizes as the average japanese 15 year old.</br>  <br>No, the last one in the grey box.<br><br>That was useful too, tho.</br></br></br>  <br>3 characters facing right, and 3 characters facing left, probably purposely symmetrical.</br>  <br>誕生花 or birth flower. I guess it's similar to birth stones or something.</br>  <br>Ah, thanks anon.</br>  Well if you guys can translate and post here what those moon runes mean in the posted profile, I can also create a combined translated chart of the characters. I can only guess what some of those are  <br>Age<br>Height<br>Weight<br>Cup Size<br>Blood Type<br>Birthday<br>Birth Flower<br><br>Dunno what the extra box means, besides what  posted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what their flower represents in flower language for example Aoi has "a small happiness"</br>  <br>what does it says in Coconut's cup size field?</br>  <br><br>Aoi Yukimura<br>Age: 15<br>Weight: 43kg<br>Cup Size: A<br>Blood Type: B<br>Birthday: Feb 19<br>Birth flower: Violet<br>Language of the flower: Little happiness</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't wear it yet.</br>  <br>"Only slightly developed" is my best guess. Maybe some anons better than me can clarify.</br>  <br>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A<wbr>A%95%E7%94%9F%E8%8A%B1</wbr></br>  <br> Language of the flower: Little happiness <br>This sounds extremely cute</br></br>  <br>"Only a slight bump" or "close to nothing."</br>  <br>small happiness<br>honest love<br>selfish beauty<br>always lovely<br>tender love<br>good news<br><br><br>probably</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hinata Kuraue<br>Age: 15<br>Height: 155cm<br>Weight: 47kg<br>Cup Size: B<br>Blood Type: A<br>Birthday: Nov 11<br>Birth flower: Viola<br>Language of the flower: Faithful Love</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kokona is the fittest.</br>  <br>She can only afford to eat once every two days; and on that note, I don't think it's really possible for kokonamum to actually make all of her daughter's clothes herself, especially since it looks almost as good as store-bought ones.</br>  <br>I don't know what you're talking about, but Kokona never had problem with her strength, if anything she was always rocking mountaineering, is perfect, and a fit girl will rarely have visible under clothes breasts.</br>  <br><br>Are those 'flowers' descriptions on the same level as blood types? As in, nothing really concrete as age/cup size but is what the nips believe to determine their personality/behaviour?</br></br>  <br>Don't know how it's coming along for you but I gave it a try. Font isn't spectacular but whatever.</br>  <br>She's a little miracle, too perfect to exist in this wretched world.</br>  <br>I want to pluck Kokona's birth flower.</br>  <br>Sure go on ahead with every other profiles, since you've already started it anyway. I'm thinking more of creating everything from scratch, with colors and screenshots from the show itself, but of course I'd need proper translations first since I know shit about Japanese language and the apparent subtlety here. Likely won't be posting in this thread, I'm hammered as shit now and waiting for the weekend to come. Thanks for the help</br>  <br>It's up to you, colored profiles and screenshots sounds like a much better idea. I wasn't entirely sure what you meant at first. Seems like the most difficulty you'll run into are the flower names and flower language as the majority of the general terms are already translated now. If you do plan on making a colorful chart, I look forward to it.<br><br>Don't drink too much.</br></br></br>  <br>Coconuts are very dangerous creatures within, and any person with malicious intent should approach with extreme caution.</br>  Can someone post that compilation image that has lots of Hinata's grins?  <br>I only have her rape face.</br>  <br><br> shit eating grin </br></br>  <br> tongue pulling </br>  Do not think bad things  Is it too late to declare my love for Hinata?  <br> All of those related videos <br> One of the original videos tags is "mountain lolis" </br></br>  <br>I bought them at 50% discount way back.<br><br>Why is no one else buying them?!</br></br></br>  <br>They probably got a mountain of them for cheap.

Thankfully, it's innocent more often than anything.</br>  I miss it.  <br><br>Let it live!<br><br>This anime had the most HNNNNG inducing cute face animations in all of the anime I have seen.

We absolutely need more Yama no Susume. Rewatching the OVA, it was such a fun and enjoyable show. Even hearing the main theme when they parody the scene where they reach the summit was enough to get me to tear up. Hopefully they weren't joking when they said "see you someday again".<br><br><br>Need to keep buying merchandise to get another season. Nice wallpaper by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure is nice having a defective monitor</br>  <br>It's not my main monitor, so it doesn't bother me too much. Been thinking of replacing it though.</br>  Yama no Susume confirmed for retelling of Huskey and Medley  <br>She should find a nice sugar daddy to give her money</br>    <br>Aoi is quite the traveler.</br>  Which yama would be the best at pitching balls and swinging shafts?  <br><br>Please stop spreading lies, no one would sell such a holy relic at that price.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps there just aren't as many righteous cultists as there should be.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  So did anyone here go recently? The S Mart guy now has dolls of all four of the main characters.  <br>Oh god, the horror  that is not an H-cup. </br>  <br>oops, meant Time's Mart</br>  <br>You know you'd cuddle the hell out of one of those.</br>  <br>What excuses do I need to come up with if the intrigued clerk asks for the reason I'm buying this?</br>  <br>Aren't those shop decorations and not for sale?</br>  <br>The clerk is the biggest yama no susume fan ever - you can't buy them, nor any of the other super rare things he has hanging on the wall. There is (was?) some merch for sale stil though.</br>  <br>Keep this thread up. I'll post mine when I get it from customs.</br>  <br>well finally an anime did americans right</br>  <br>I'm thinking about another pair for that cheap, I preordered them and it's hard to keep Aoi clean.<br><br>Kokona lives in the closet. Poor Kokona, so poor.</br></br></br>  <br> hard to keep Aoi clean <br>Dude just hand wash them. Also what the heck are you doing to it to make it that dirty. My daki usually lasts for 5 months before I see some noticeable browning due to dead skin cells.</br></br>  <br><br>So by the time I have enough money and time to get all these, they would've already either been sold out, out of production, all bought or end up rotting in a forgotten corner in a dark warehouse?</br></br>  What if being defeated was exactly what Doffei was aiming for ?  <br>Reread the Arlong fight. Luffy suddenly, out of nowhere, becomes way stronger and breaks a steel harabachi with his grip whereas before he couldn't break out of concrete.</br>  <br>You might have noticed that Luffy was confused, blinded, being goofy, underwater and then pissed off.</br>  <br>Fuck that. I hate insects too. Godless creatures. Fuck them all. Even a butterfly would freak me out as a child.</br>  <br>He IS a walking fortress with a whole army, ton of weapons and who knows what else inside. In a one-on-one fight, if he can reduce size of objects, what stops him from shrinking an opponent to tiny size and simply crushing him? Good enough power for me.<br>Besides, he seems to be a scheming type, not the one that has to kick every other ass to establish dominance. He'll be totally fine joining some major force.</br></br>  <br>look, it's the Jurassic park meme.</br>  Karma won.  The flashback pretty much ruined the manga for me. Is there even a point in assassination now? Its pretty obvious that sensei won't destroy the planet because he dindunuffn, all that training was for naught (oh, I'm sorry, they became better people, like anyone gives a fuck) and the ending is obviously going to be sensei Iron Gianting himself into the sun  <br> all previous efforts <br>you talk as if they had tried a lot during these 15 volumes.<br><br><br>we are talking about the life of the best teacher they ever had in life, and they treat it like a trivial thing. "right, we try to save, but if doesnt work, we kill".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they treat it like a trivial thing <br>Oh I'm sorry did you read the newest fucking chapter before everyone else?<br>Beating the shit out of each other hardly feels like they were treating it trivial.</br></br></br>  <br>If you hadn't realized by now that Koro-sensei was lying out of his ass about destroying the world, you haven't really been reading.</br>  <br> Its pretty obvious that sensei won't destroy the planet because he dindunuffn <br>Wasn't he a ticking timebomb like the anti-matter mouse? He can't help it unless someone kills him<br> and the ending is obviously going to be sensei Iron Gianting himself into the sun <br>Wasn't this somewhere explained why this wasn'f possible?<br>I'm pretty sure it had to do with the sun being fucked up if Koro goes Hiroshima, and as result ruining life for everyone here on earth</br></br></br></br></br>  What are your thoughts on episode 3?  This show is creating too many memes for my taste, dropped  <br>She wouldn't even remember you.</br>  <br><br>If they could break through the door how come they can't break through the stacks of chairs now?</br></br>  <br>The dropped meme is my favorite.</br>  <br>From what we know about GG zombies I doubt that.</br>  1.
