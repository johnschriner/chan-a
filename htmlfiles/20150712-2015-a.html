It's just an opinion. Another scenario is if they are trying to state something they think is a fact. It doesn't look like he's pushing it on us, but when you read it, it makes you feel as if he's saying that what he is saying is obvious fact.

You'd think it would be more common for them to go up to 15 or 16 episodes  <br>Or maybe because the alternative is pure and simple shit.</br>  <br>That's a silly reason not to watch it.<br><br>It's cute and fun. It's not AOTS material but it's not Glasslip either.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Because the studio wanted to adapt everything before Sasaki appears.</br>  <br><br>I could accept it until it became boring as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Or you know, because it's for the most part just a mediocre SOL kind of thing with the only thing standing out about it is its use of Haruhi characters and even they're essentially caricatures of the original characters.</br>  I was waiting for caffeine to continue this show, but it looks like they're dead. Is Lemon a good release?  <br>It's a better SoL than the original Haruhi</br>  <br>Haruhi isn't a SoL, why would you judge it as one?</br>    <br>Do you really? You must be pretty new then.

It could've lined with the ones in bottom.</br>  <br>right<br><br>it's not even as if the creator is actively trying to hurt the fans. Anno uses Rebuild to comment on/attack the fan base more than any other series creator, and while what he's doing is fantastic and stays in line with his original theme of an anime that talks about itself and its fans through scathing metaphor, it's definitely the harder for waifufag-level viewers to digest<br><br>on the other hand, this is simply a depiction of characters in a new universe without an overt intent of breaking the fourth wall (and mindraping those it finds) inherent in its design. there should be no caterwauling, but /a/utists etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  Taaki?  She is celebrating America. obviously.  <br><br>POKE Haruhi</br></br>  <br>In the end Doraemon is just a SoL about the daily life of elementary school boy Nobita and his robot cat from the future who can pull future gadgets from his 4-dimensional pocket.<br>Slayers is just a SoL where you watch the daily life of a sorceress and her friends with some light evil god slaying.<br><br>There's more to SoL than just light or no presence of plot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still think they way they draw boobs in this show makes them look like implants</br>  <br>I'd implant Haruhi with something of my own if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>tbh I'm smh at this post, fam. <br><br>Immense shitposting like twitter niggas; it's distressing.</br></br></br>  It's ok to be gay  Don't open it /a/ you can't handle it  <br>This post triggered me.</br>  <br>Like with most things, it's okay to be gay, but not gay and 3D.</br>  <br>there was this guy called moot</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>I was convinced it was one guy for a while, and kept telling them to fuck off.<br>Now I'm not sure.</br></br>  MMmmmmmmm  <br>Abbreviations like that one look stupid in a place like this, to be honest.</br>  <br>Absolutely delicious.</br>  <br>Definitely enticing.</br>  <br> What's Haruhi's swimsuit implying? <br><br>That she's a big fan of Pink Floyd?</br></br></br>  <br>I feel you anon.

He just designed the important characters and outlined a plot.</br>  <br>Best couple</br>  any subbed uploads yet?  Did anything happen this episode? I missed it.  So Beerus movie is set right after the 4th episode?   After all these years, Vegeta is still top tsundere   <br><br>subs file is taken down</br></br>  Spanish subs when?  <br>They've been up for a while<br>http://www.animeid.moe/ver/dragon-b<wbr>all-super-2</wbr></br></br>  <br>I edited the picture.<br>Better or worse?</br></br>  <br>Out of character.</br>  <br> Removing Tsundere Vegeta <br><br>Ya dun goofed.</br></br></br>  <br>So he feels no happiness with Bulma around?</br>  <br>Yamcha is Bulma's age. Early in Dragon Ball he says to Puar he's only scared of girls his age, and he's scared of Bulma, therefore they are the same age. Yamcha is 38, same as Bulma. MAYBE he's a year or two older at the most.</br>  <br>He probably does, but wouldn't show it because pride.</br>  Spanish dub when?  <br>hes not kicking the shit out of someone, so him smiling is totally out of character</br>  <br>Bulma isn't 38 though</br>  i just saw a raw pop up on nyaa  Watching Vegeta being such a dick right now on  toonami  is fun compared to how he is now on Super.  <br>She is 38 in BoG. That's her canon age. Toriyama says so. You suck it.</br>  omg I loved this episode I already watched the episode with subs in spanish and it was a 10/10 episode  <br><br>are you even vaguely familiar with Vegeta's character at all</br></br>  Where's our speedsubber from episode one.<br><br>Come on fucker we need you.</br></br>  <br> Needing someone who doesn't even have a basic grasp on the English or Japanese language to sub an episode </br>  <br>https://twitter.com/ElSpark15/statu<wbr>s/620065504955203584<br><br> English coming soon.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEE</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, she's definitely older based on her age at the start of Dragon Ball vs how much time has passed. Either the writers just made something up and assumed that there wasn't a "right" answer and that no one would fact check them, or Bulma is lying in-universe (if this were the case I feel like they probably would have followed it up with some sort of joke though)</br></br>  <br>Not like this, like this.</br>  <br>She did lie, I thought it was fairly obvious from how the scene played out. She's about 42 actually.</br>  <br>Bulma was obviously lying about her age. She should be 45ish during Battle of Gods based on the manga.</br>  Anyone making a Vegeta Then Vegeta Now picture?

Watching DBZ on  Toonami  and Goku is reading Krillin's mind.<br><br>I Toryiama forgot about that.</br></br>  <br>www.kanzenshuu.com/production/toriy<wbr>ama/</wbr></br>  <br>she really is amazing</br>  <br>Did you ever read the novel journey to the west?? Toriyama was inspired by it. And he based character on that. But the only thing similar between both is character setting like there is one monkey, a girl,a desert bandit and they are on a journey to find an object and to pay tribute he added kintoun and PowerPole other than that there is no similarity. the personality of char are tottaly different. so stop saying it journey to the west. After all the novel have characters derived from ancient Indian deities. Heck the whole chinese culture is nothing but derived from ancient india.</br>  But...will we see Frieza's ultimate form?  When are they going to fight?<br>I want to see some DBZ with modern animation.<br><br> inb4 movies <br><br>Fuck them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The animation so far doesn't impress me at all.

I always thought he was a manlet compared to her.</br>  <br>How much do you wanna bet Toriyama had nothing to do with his design?</br>    <br>nothing because that's what he does for a living besides working on Dragon Ball.<br><br>He's the monster designer for Dragon Quest.<br><br>Designing cool monsters like that is his specialty.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's making the character drafts, so he had a hand in his design.</br>  <br><br>the time</br></br>  <br>Clock so nips know what time it is.</br>  <br>they are off to train ^_^</br>  <br><br>ayy did this in 5 seconds im to tired to think of something clever</br></br>  <br>Trunks is the Prince of the Prince of Saiyans.

All it reminds me of is how much of a freak I am.</br>   in the gym shower, with their friend Steve <br><br>STEVE, YOU SAID EVERYBODY DOES IT!<br>STEEEEEEEVE!</br></br></br>   On the computer <br> Just after waking up <br> On the toilet before I take a shower/shit <br>Who else is with me</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck do you do?</br>  <br>I've always wanted to learn the handless technique. Teach me, great master.</br>  <br><br> 2015 and not going hands free.. <br><br>constanza.png</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hiryuu is subbing it</br>  <br> no on the toilet after a satisfying poop </br>   not 'whenever you feel like it' <br><br>Do you guys have masturbation schedules or something?</br></br>  <br>Hands really are the safest, I used to just hump the bed. But that ruins sensitivity and cuts bloodflow. So what do you do?</br>  <br>That's bad for you. Apparently some poop can leak out your dick if you're not careful</br>  <br><br>Onahole.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Basically this. I think its called pressure masturbation.<br><br>Basically, lie down on your stomach, preferably grabbing an object like a pillow for support, and move your lower body/pelvis up and down, rubbing it against the object.  If you were a girl, you could use the corner of table-kun. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think my dick got bent downwards because I've been doing this for a long time. But who knows?</br>  <br>Holy shit</br>  <br>Man I can't do it like that ever.<br>Actually, I think I have it worse than most people because I can't just lay there and move my hand to get off.<br><br>Have to be laying on my back or sitting back-ish, legs completely tensed (like you're stretching, but don't release it) and pinching the underside of my dick on the back of the neck. No jerking, just pinching.<br><br>I have never been able to get off normally, but it's this or squeezing my balls with the same stretching process.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, you don't want to do that kind of masturbation. It effects your bloodflow in dangerous ways. Like causing penile fracture.</br></br>  <br>What the FUCK man</br>  <br>I've heard 72% of all statistics are inaccurate.</br>  <br> 4 days late </br>  <br><br>It's like those niggas don't know how potent fapping is as sleeping pills</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck jerks it in the shower? I can understand every now and then to change things up, but once you finish it all goes to hell.</br>  <br>rather deal with HS shitty typesetting than wait for their delayed episodes</br>  <br>I get the pinching and ball stuff, but is there anything wrong with the stretching bit? It seems perfectly natural but I never hear anybody talking about it.  If I ever do have sex I'll never have to worry about blowing early. Absolutely cannot cum unless I will it. </br>  <br>Aren't there people who get their kicks by masturbating in places where they more likely to be found? Think of it like that. The risk just increases the amount the total amount of sexual pleasure.</br>  <br>Don't do this kind of masturbation. It'll negatively impact your sex life in different ways.</br>  <br>Yeah, no the risks of this is less masturbating in a public place and more grabbing a random little girl and rubbing it between her thighs.</br>  <br>being found =/= breaking your dick</br>   this thread <br>man, and I though I was the weirdo for using dildos to masturbate</br>  Enough about boys, where do girls do it?  <br>They can do it?</br>  <br>Do you understand my pain? I've been trying for the past thirty minutes but I can't do it. I've done it my way, the way I learned by myself, for so long I don't know how to do it with my hands. Nothing I try is working. Is this the choice I have to bear for the rest of my life: either never masturbate again or destroy what I hold dear completely?</br>  <br> What? <br><br>I cannot fall asleep any other way.</br></br></br>  <br>I think girls have to rub the area and it feels good</br>  <br>Tables</br>  <br> On the toilet before I take a shower/shit <br>I'm with you.</br></br>  <br>So the safest masturbation is by hand, isn't it? I have not actually tried to fap by hand.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's the safest. If you are having difficulties converting use some lotion or something.</br>  <br>I had a fracture myself. But thankfully it wasn't severe enough to impact erection.<br><br>I can hardly jack it without being too violent. Can't do it on a toilet or shower because I would damage the room. Can only hump. It sucks being Bane sized.</br></br></br>  im so close to dropping the animu, does anyone know if the mango is better?  <br><br> on the toilet <br>How do you get it in the bowl? Are you really that small?</br></br></br>  <br> They can't watch porn on their computers <br>Why not? Censoring of genitalia by itself can't stop anyone.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>oh you mean what everyone did to their dakimakura?</br>  <br>You are a big guy.</br>  <br>1%</br>  <br>Donno about them but almost 100% of my faps are sitting backwards on the toilet since there is no cleanup needed.</br>  The VA made my sides go into orbit.  <br>Not a whole lot of main roles for her. This one probably won't benefit her that much.<br>http://myanimelist.net/people/28755<wbr>/Shizuka_Ishigami</wbr></br></br>  <br>Use your other hand or something. If you're properly aroused it shouldn't take a lot of jerking it to cum. Watch some porn that has your favorite fetishes and just get a natural boner then jerk it. If you can't cum within 3-5 minutes, something is really wrong with your dick/libido/mind.</br>  <br>Enjoy your shit subs and cancer.</br>  <br>I wasn't that impressed with their translation and script last time.</br>  <br> Masturbating in the shower <br>How do people do this? Its just uncomfortable, standing and masturbating, but you also have the conflicting sensation of the water hitting either your stomach or back which is more distracting rather than relaxing when you're trying to get a load off. And plus, everything is wet with water, which is a pretty shit masturbatory lubricant when it comes down to it. Honestly its more comfortable to be sitting down or lying down rather then standing and beating it in the shower.<br><br>Plus, isn't the point of showering to be clean? Why dirty yourself in the process and clean all the gross cum-water mix off your cock, balls, and taint instead of cleaning and then taking a shower?</br></br></br></br>  <br> gross cum-water mix off your cock, balls, and taint <br>The cum should spurt out, not dribble onto your balls. Fap less.</br></br>  <br> standing <br>You've got it all wrong</br></br>  <br> 時間帯 translated as "Where" </br>  <br>In bed before sleeping masterrace.  Who wants to join me? </br>   KARA DA NO SHIN KARA ICCHAIMASU <br> S-O-X! S-O-X! S-O-X! S-O-X! S-O-X! <br>Why is the ED so fucking catchy?</br></br>  I can't fap in the shower. Standing up kills my boner.  <br> clean all the gross cum-water mix off your cock, balls, and taint instead of cleaning and then taking a shower? <br>You aren't shower fapping correctly if you're getting it all over yourself.</br></br>  <br><br>I actually learned how to masturbate with this method. In fact it was the only way to fap from about 10 til I turned about 21-22 where I was finally able to fap properly using my hands. I have been doing with my hands ever since.<br><br>Its a lot messier because you get cum all over your stomach and bed. Which can then stain the bed through the sheets. Plus you need a bed to fap which is a whole different logistic. And from what other anons in this thread said it may cause bloodflow problems. I did not know this but luckily my guy has been doing fine and it has been nearly a decade since I quit so I hope I dodged the bullet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>aren't you just humping your pillow?</br>  <br>My nigga, the comfiest way to jerk it.<br><br><br>In what way?<br><br><br>How would that even cause penile fracture? You don't bang your dick on the bed with extreme force, you hardly ever move. Maybe if your weight is 200 kg it's dangerous, but otherwise I don't see how it's any more dangerous than using your hand. <br>I've been masturbating like that for 19 years now and yet to see any negative effects. Is there a source to your claims or it's something your mom said to you to keep you from jerking off?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Phone in one hand, penis in other while lying in bed <br> tfw not even an option </br>  <br>Shower of course.</br>  <br>I just back my ass up as far as I can when i'm about to cum then lean forward a little bit in order to aim my dick at the inside of the toilet bowl kinda like in my diagram I made</br>  <br>Whether it can cause penile fracture depends on a lot of things your total weight, like you mentioned, penile bent, position, firmness of the mattress, etc. Doesn't necessarily mean it will. All I know is that since I switched to using hands, my sensitivity has definitely increased.</br>  <br>That's ridiculous. Fapping releases chemicals that help you sleep, reduce stress, and relax headaches. It's like a wonderful cureall. Thanks to fapping in bed, I haven't been sick for over a decade now.</br>   fapping with your hand  <br> in 2015 <br><br>fucking why</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is what I do. Handfags are missing out.</br></br>  <br>It also cures nasal congestion.</br>  <br>It's thanks to fapping in bed that I cured my homosexuality and met my waifu. Everyone should do it.<br><br> These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA </br></br></br>  <br>I still live with my parents and don't need them finding onaholes</br>  <br>I can't bend my back forward enough.</br>  <br>Shower.</br>  <br>On top of running washing machines</br>  <br>I'm the same way with the legs, thought I was the only one.</br>  <br> diagram </br>  <br> and relax headaches. <br><br>It makes it worse for me.<br><br> I might be somewhat M, but I find joy/ challenge in fapping while feeling pain </br></br></br></br></br>   masturbating <br>I seriously hope none of you do this unironically.</br>  <br> not masturbating gently </br>  <br>The only people who say they don't masturbate are junior high school students who think it's embarrassing</br>  <br>I have trouble keeping it up does that count as not doing it?</br>  <br>You can't honestly be serious. Red that post again.</br>  <br> I'm the only one that can only masturbate in front of a computer? I just can't get it up anywhere else, and even if for some reason I do I can't finish the job till I come back home and sit in front of the pc, one time I travel to the jungle for 1 week, couldn't fap all that week, first thing I did when I came back home was fap for 8 hours straight. </br>   fapping in the morning  <br>The fuck? Why would you want to waste it all so early? <br>I usually just have short sessions of edging to keep me nice and horny all day long and release it before going to sleep</br></br>  <br>Hell, I even kiss him on the head</br>  <br>I try not to fap unless I absolutely can't control it anymore which is usually once every 2 weeks or so. I used to fap everyday and felt like shit. Wasting an hour or so jerking it just to get like 5 seconds of pleasure. Shit's unproductive. I didn't want to be weak minded and reliant on that shit because up to a certain point, fapping is all mind over matter, so I decided to become my own boss and train myself to not fap. Fapping twice a month is pretty good progress for me.</br>  <br>Alternatively you can try laying on your back with some doujins that make you diamonds. By flexing the base of the shaft in intervals you're able to build up and cum without any sort of actual stimulus on the dick itself. It's hard and multiple times I've given up and finished with a quick jerk but it's produced some of the longest orgasms I've ever had.  Almost prostate orgasm tier. </br>  <br>Look at all that money you wasted. You're really no different than a normalfag buying a CR subscription and streaming when you can torrent for free by using your hands.</br>  <br>I don't know? Maybe the morning wood is too much for some people?</br>  <br> Like causing penile fracture <br>This scares me and I think about it every time I crank it.</br></br>  <br>I wish I had that much self control<br><br>I'm too much of a slut for that.</br></br></br>  <br>that's not how it works.</br>  <br>It really can't be helped anon. We're all weak minded people, and we're sexual beings by nature. We get urges and have to release them. The key is not becoming a fap addict. Balance is power.</br>  <br>yes, also SSR meds fuck up my pace and number of erections</br>   this entire thread is filled with guys talking about when and how they beat their meat. <br><br>I'm okay with this.</br></br>  <br> morning shower <br>That's like the only time I won't do it.<br>Masturbating in the shower fucking sucks.</br></br></br>  i can't believe no one brought up the #1 reason to not jerk off in the shower<br><br> cooked/congealed semen sticking to everything and everywhere that doesn't rinse off so it's a ticking timebomb </br></br>   morning shower <br>To what purpose? Do you people sleep in filthy beds or something?</br>  <br>I don't get why it's so popular. Hot water makes all viscous and shit and it's impossible to get off your hands, floor, dick</br>  <br>bed head, sleep sweat if it's too warm</br>  <br>You sweat in your sleep anon.</br>  Anyone else invent various poses for masturbating.<br><br>Most recently I've made a pose which I like to call the delinquent where I raise my leg and place my foot on the wall like I'm threatening someone.</br></br>  <br><br>Man, I thought I was the only one. Also, I'm 90% sure that the "it damages your dick" thing only applies to the metod where you lie facedown in bed and hump. I've been doing this for years and everything's fine down there aside from a slight lean, although I'm still a virgin so I don't know if I'd have problems with sex or not.</br></br>  <br> prostate orgasm  <br>Literally how? Be detailed.</br></br>  Doesn't semen get stuck in the shower drainage?  <br>Seems harder to finish in the shower</br>    <br>did you watch the episode? the internet porn was delete</br>   in the shower that popular <br>But it's doing it while standing is awkward. Why not do it sitting on the toilet or counter and releasing right into the tissue in your other hand/onto the bath towel if neither hand is free?</br>  <br>not him but you take hot showers and see how it gels up, right? it'll clump up along with the hair and form an unholy ball of stuff. i have... extracted this concoction from my drain a few times in the past before i decided to put a mesh filter on the drain that i can just clean out once a week or two.<br><br>(the clog was quite unholy)</br></br></br>  <br>Personally speaking it just helps me wake up, I'm not a morning person in the least.<br><br>And that said yeah, like other anons fapping in the shower never made much sense to me. Like I get how actual shower sex is appealing, but fapping alone in there leaves you stranded without anything to look at.</br></br></br>  Why is the percentage so high for shower and so low compared to every other option? 85% is a really huge number. Do japs dont have any other options? Personally i do it when i feel like it, usually before sleeping,  sometimes at/after work in the bathroom <br><br>When it says shower do they just mean the place or when they are actually showering? I can understand grabing my tablet into the shower sitting down and fap into the showersdrainage. However i think fapping while actually showering is pretty weird, you cant use material (books, tablet, computer) and standing up while fapping is not that comforable. <br>What am i missing, almost seems like woman were part of this statistic aswell and maybe they prefer the shower much more</br></br></br>  <br>You just refuse to acknowledge anything that does not fit into your own narrow set of preconceptions. If you'd take some time to think about it though, you'd realize that I'm not saying anything too strange.<br><br>For example imagine that you have two meals, one from some shitty fast food restaurant, and one from the best restaurant in town. However, the good meal has been left sitting in the refrigerator for a day or two and then reheated in the microwave. As a result, the quality of both meals is relatively similar. But eating the reheated meal, you can at least think about the quality it once had, while the fast-food meal, while fresh, you know could never have tasted better than what you have in your hands. As a result, even if the reheated meal tastes worse, it in fact will make you happier.<br><br>Let's extend the analogy a bit further, and now assume you have ordered meals from every restaurant in town, and then kept them in the refrigerator for a day or two, and then reheated them all. Whether the original food was good or bad, they now taste more or less the same, as shitty leftover food. But because of this, you, as a consumer, have no way of knowing if the leftovers came from the best restaurant in town, or from a more mediocre place.

Best fap ever XD <br>No thank you, I don't want to literally squish my penis and balls under my own weight while fapping and I'm a skinnyfag for fuck's sake; can't imagine how unpleasant it would be if you were fat. I also don't want to leave stains on my mattress that I sleep on every night.<br><br>Tl;dr you're all doing it wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck is this even bad for you? Am I misunderstanding the position you're describing?</br>  <br>I'm uncut too but precum is not enough sometime, while with water and soap it's perfect.<br><br>And place your dick under the shower stream for extra pleasure/stimulus.<br>A good way to clean it and pleasuring yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this.<br>Have you ever invented a new way to masturbate, /a/?<br> Personally, I created a few home made onaholes. </br></br></br>  <br> there was a thread a month ago where everyone said they thought they were the only one <br>It can't damage your dick though that's a myth, unless you're actually crushing and bending it in doing so, though if that were the case you'd have to be a massive masochist to still keep up your libido.</br></br>  <br>change where to when and tell me, in this situation, what difference it makes in the meaning conveyed.  none </br>  <br>i wish boys could get off by just pointing a showerhead at their crotch :x</br>  <br>right, guess it's time to stop fapping in the shower.</br>  <br> :x <br><br>Anyway, girls are a lot messier when it comes to that.<br>That alone make up for not getting off to a stream of water</br></br></br></br>  <br>I used to do this when i first started cumming<br><br>11 till 13 i think<br><br>did it again recently. A bit messy nowadays, but the orgasm feels great</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>materials used?</br>  <br> who says men cant use shower heads to wank? </br>  <br>Never heard about the baking soda acetyl combo?<br>It blasts out clogs like nothing else.</br></br>     not wanking using only your thighs <br>Dont even need to unzip my pants</br>  <br>well, no one, but you'll have to write down a secret manual for posterity if you know how</br>  <br>ironic masturbation?</br>  Anyone managed to cum only with the power of though ? <br>I recall doing it once when younger.</br>  <br>Try it from a greater height. With a moderate force of water stream stimulating the tip you can achieve orgasm in 30-40 minutes. Costs a fuckton of water and you get used to it really fast though but do it once in a month and feels refreshing.</br>  <br> Why is the percentage so high for shower and so low compared to every other option? <br>I'd imagine it's something like<br> Well, my pants are off, might as well. </br></br></br>  <br> That style <br>Now that is some shiggy diggy shit right there</br></br>  <br> handless technique. <br><br>I came in my pants while editing h-manga more than once, hands on keyboard. That counts?</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry micropenis-kun but my erection can't fit in my pants.</br>  <br>It's been a while, but I used a toilet paper roll as the body, extended it by sticking another one around it and locking it on the other side with a shower gel head or something like that. Filled it inside with toilet paper and shower gel. Also, duct tape to make things hold.</br>  <br>you mean you never did? Just set it to a strong pressure setting and hold it at the bottom of your penis gland, if it feels tingly its the right spot, takes forever but eventually it will lead to a very strong and messy orgasm (youll get jizz glued to every body-hair in the vicinity and that shit sticks very hard when it came in contact with water).</br>  <br> Aim the shower head at your head, find an angle that works for you. I use the tug method to work the shaft, you can try different methods. When you're about to cum aim the shower head against your hole. You'll become weak /a/non, you'll become very weak </br>  <br>It goes down to your ankles?<br>The whole point is you point it down your pants leg mate</br></br>  <br>do you just point it right on the tip? like right on the urethra? (wouldn't that hurt, if not then, then afterwards because of the pressure forcing water in or hot water drying out the mucous membrane)</br>  <br>shower gel is a horrible lubricant though, shit burns like hell afterwards.</br>  <br>Nah, that shit chafes.</br>  <br>yeah makes sense, still that applies to the bathroom at work and before going to bed aswell. Especially the bed choice is pretty popular around here (for me aswell)</br>  <br>A bit lower and on the underside. You can easily find the spot if you try.<br> No I won't make a picture how to do it. </br></br>   jacking off in the shower <br>SHIGGY</br>  <br>9000 hours in MS paint,</br>  I can't mastubate standing up, and doing it sitting down takes like ~2 hours. Usually gives more intense orgasms though, although that may be for different factors than just me sitting down. <br>I have no clue how people manage to do it in the shower, shit just doesn't work AT ALL.<br><br>Anyone else like this?</br></br></br>  Is it time?    yay!  A bump for the cute ice fairy.  it's time  great time to go skiing  My waifu, no touch.<br><br>Also, volume 9 chapter 1 spoilers.</br></br>  Volume 9 summary/spoilers<br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw we'll never see volume 9 Kingdom   massacre  animated.<br><br>Why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>Buy the BDs</br>  <br> we will never see   clementine juicing  uncensored in any media <br>pls</br></br>  I'll be happy if this can become split cour.  <br>Isn't the hug in volume 3?</br>  <br>Keyword is the uncensored glory it deserves. With Clementines innards hanging from her mouth/in her mouth.</br>  <br>Yeah, probably not, I don't think it even goes into that much detail in the LN. The BDs might give the scene a little more detail, but don't get your hopes up.</br>  <br><br>Considering how graphicly it was described we probably will get a pan away or something</br></br>  <br>I would be contend to even get a complete expression of terror on her face and blood curling with the spine snap.</br>  <br>It goes into detail. How Ainz has to use a spell to clean himself because of her vomit and shit.</br>  <br>why spoilers when volume 5,6,7 and 8 aren't translated yet?</br>  <br>Anon, do you understand the meaning of spoilers?</br>  <br>So that we can harden our bones from the sheer grace of Papa Bones' splendor.</br>    <br>oh man Papa Bones is ready to rip some major shit.</br>  600 years ago: 6 Great Gods<br>500 years ago: 8 Kings<br>200 years ago: 13 Heroes (at least one of them)<br>200 years ago?: Minotaur, Goblin King<br><br>Anymore players?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can I get a summary of what happened to make this moment?  I take it the empire got uppity, ainz slapped their shit and now they're scrabbling to apologise, whilst also plotting to band up and attack nazarick? When did Nazarick openly establish itself as a power? Was this because of the lizard incident, or did ainz do some other big shit? </br>  <br>You know what really worries me. It's  the fact that Ainz might have just been sleeping for 600+ years, while the Guardians are just sitting there, waiting for him to wake up </br>  Would anyone put Ainz in the "hero" category just because he's not going around provoking people? Like I'm looking at this nigga who's disappointed because he thought Ainz was going to be more "evil" than he apparently is.  <br>Here<br/></br>  <br>Has he read to the current volume or just the translated parts?<br><br><br>How would that even work?</br></br></br></br>  <br> How would that even work? <br>How did he even get to the next world? I don't fucking know.</br></br>  <br><br>he must be mad he isn't retard evil or something</br></br>  <br>Nah, they would have told him something like "Our Momonga-sama has finally awaken from his slumber" and then asked him how his sleep was.<br><br>That, and they also remember times when they were in Yggdrasil getting raided.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure one of the human nations would have noticed the odd ruins during those 600 years.</br>  <br>That's a bit too New Gate-y for me though.</br>  <br>Okay cool, so it is just Nazarick entering the world stage.</br>  <br>Nigga tried to spy on Ainz but Ainz already spied on him. You don't bullshit with the bullshitter</br>  <br>I don't think so, an example would be Mare and Aura, both of which would qualify as a lifespan human race, I think it's state that both are less than 600 years old.</br>  <br>At the beginning they mention that the area outside the tomb has obviously changed so that definitely shouldn't be the case. On top of that someone would have found the tomb by then since it was previously not hidden.</br>  <br>He's a villain, but he isn't evil. If that makes sense.</br>  <br>Just the thought of them sitting there waiting for their next order for hundreds of years breaks my heart</br>  <br>no one will buy the BDs and this will never get a season 2<br><br>its a shame, but as usual the nips have shit taste and likely will not even be interested in this show in the slightest</br></br></br>  <br>A story about an evil Lich would be interesting. I'm talking about a story in the vein of Maou no Hajimekata. But an overly paranoid and pragmatic Overlord with a penchant for doing any and everything for the sake of hi children is just as good.</br>  <br>He's never been "evil," he's just amoral towards things that are not part of Nazarick.</br>  <br>So then you buy them.</br>  Vol 4 kinda ends on a dead note doesn't it? Just him closing his eyes  <br><br>He's like one of those stupid sympathetic JRPG/shonen villains but not stupid<br><br>'I KILLED 1000s OF PEOPLE JUST TO MEET MY FRIENDS AGAIN' etc etc</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I dont know man. He condones torture and orders genocide to get better minions. Hes fairly evil.</br></br>  <br>Makes sense. He's definitely not doing anything for the sake of others outside his family and isn't it stipulated somewhere that heroes must do good things? Oh right. He can be considered a "hero" to the denizens of Nazarick.</br>  <br>The popularity ranking of the summer shows has Overlord in the same ranking as Mononga when in was in Yggdrasil, middle upper.</br>  <br>Yeah, the sympathetic villain. That's who he is, probably because we're getting the story from his pov.</br>  <br>He's only paranoid, and getting as much info about the new world so he can better protect his guild. He does get a bit more evil as the volumes progress, but I wouldn't necessarily call his intentions in the first four volumes evil, more like paranoid and a bit misguided.</br>  <br> Hes fairly evil. <br><br>He is only using criminals and scumbags. I rather call him egoistical.</br></br></br>  <br>He reconciles it with the fact that he's just torturing "bad" people and he doesn't particularly see any race other than humans (part of his remaining human self) and those of Nazarick as sentient beings.<br><br>The unfortunate thing is that he just doesn't think that far when it comes to his morality, his ability to sympathize is actually being affected by his form as a lich, he notes this in the beginning. Post-Shaltear Ainz would probably have never interfered in the battle at Carne Village.</br></br></br>  <br>Stalker pts also aren't as bad as they could be. So there's hope. Just not a lot of it.</br>  Best girl and mai waifu.  <br>Please, Demiurge only uses the finest humans.</br>  <br>So far Ainz has  Killed 4 adventurers, ordered undead to kill adventurers for credit, tortured people for information, sent his people to capture or kill those who wouldn't be missed for knowledge and experiments, killed hundreds of lizardmen just for combat experience, and subjugated said lizardmen.<br><br>I mean sure he does a good deed here, has a code of honour, and dotes on his "children", but his alignment -500 feels pretty damn accurate most of the time.</br></br> </br>  <br> Post-Shaltear Ainz would probably have never interfered in the battle at Carne Village. <br><br>Yes he would have, he only first intervened because Sebas was getting jittery. If there's anything he wants from his children, is for them to speak their mind. Seeing Sebas wanting to protect something of his own accord would've have still swayed him.</br></br></br>  <br>I see your Naberal, I raise you one Shalltear.</br>  <br>those faces, oh lord.</br>  <br>A raise usually requires something of a higher value.</br>  <br><br>He planed to wipe out five entire tribes of lizardmen who never did anything for better mooks. Thats pretty evil no matter how you cut it.<br><br>He kills that adventure dude without a second thought and he was just a bit of an asshole.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine then. I'll raise you one Solution Epsilon.</br>  <br><br>Rotten goods needs no apply.</br></br>  <br>Why did you post an image of a chair?</br>  <br>  During his speech about making Ainz Ooal Gown an eternal legend, all the minions will have Hellsing villain smiles. </br>  <br><br><br><br> Sebas  &gt; α &gt; ζ &gt; ε &gt; β &gt; Δ &gt; Γ</br></br></br></br>  Episodes titles<br><br>Episode 2: Floor Guardians<br>Episode 3: Battle of Carne Village<br>Episode 4: Ruler of Death<br>Episode 5: The Two Adventurers <br><br>So will people drop this by episode 3?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>No. Looks fine to me.</br>  <br>Not confirmed but I'm pretty sure that most of the real big end of the world demon lords were players or bosses that got transported over.<br><br>Also one thing I'm wondering about the future of the series<br><br>Chapter 1 it mentions the Fireworks the GM's were doing as a final sendoff and ainz not bothering going. Now everyone that gets transported seems to be with whoevers around them.<br><br>So what're the odds the big human race capital and all the players watching the fireworks together there get transported in?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're only going up to Volume 3. I don't know if this is good or not. I've seen what happens to rushed series, but I still want more of Papa Bones and his adventures.</br>  <br>So it's 4+4+4+1 then, no lizardmen. As it should be, vol 4 is a horrible place to stop. Extra episode might be a beach episode or the drama cd.</br>    <br> beach episode <br> UMI-DA </br></br>  <br>But werewolves are the only correct number one in a heteromorphic guild.</br>  <br>A wolf is still a filthy mammal.<br><br>Try an insect, at least.</br></br></br>  <br>If I recall, the sea in the New World somehow doesn't have any salt in it.</br>  <br>I bet one of the greed kings wanted something to drink and world item'd the ocean</br>  yore waifu is slut! Slut!  <br>What an asshole haha</br>  <br>Does an ant mantis count?</br>  So does anyone know if there's a folder with all the illustrations and character sheets and nothing else?  what could happen if someone said that ainz was actually a human..  <br>Death.</br>  <br>I know some illustrations are in the Mega download, not sure which though.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>i dont really think it matters<br><br>i mean his skeleton is vaguely humanoid so i dont see why no one would consider the possiblity that he was one before lichdom</br></br></br></br>  <br>ur waifu a shit</br>  <br> Those faces. <br>   Sebas at the end gave a 'I'm too old for this shit.' look. </br></br>  <br>I thought we were talking cute battle maids<br><br>And you can't say Cocytus without saying cute<br><br>So why not</br></br></br></br></br>  Did we ever get a full list of who created who in the guild?<br><br>Off the top of my head I only remember<br><br>Ainz: Pandora's Actor<br>Tabula: Albedo<br>Whitebrim: Aura and Mare<br>Perorochino: Shalltear</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ainz is Chaotic Neutral  <br>The wiki has a lot of the creators listed<br>http://overlordmaruyama.wikia.com/w<wbr>iki/Overlord_Wiki</wbr></br></br>  <br> chaotic neutral <br> has never done anything chaotic <br> everything good he's done was part of a greater evil plan and uses evil means to complete noble goals <br><br>  I know this is bait some guy posts every once in a while but I must respond  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Lawful Evil?</br>  <br>There was one of the guildies that left to be a mangaka or something that designed the Pleiades. Don't recall the name though. Touch Me made Sebas, and I believe Tabula also made Albedo's sisters.</br>  <br>He's got a code he lives by, but still does questionable or sometimes outright evil things. Sounds accurate to me.</br>  <br>Not everything. He saved Carne village because that little girl reminded him of when he was saved from gankers by Touch Me back in the early days of Yggdrasil.</br>  <br>He'd be willing to help the less fortunate if one of his children asks for mercy, can't be any of the evils if he's willing to do good.</br>  So can you revive from dying of old age in the new world?<br><br>Zasaerasr(whatever the lizard dudes name was) got rezzed and only lost 1 level...so you would think most players would still be around</br></br>  <br>Did you not read last week's stuff at the end of Volume 4?<br><br>Ainz goes out of his way to say that regular resurrection won't do anything about life span. Though he does think to himself that it might be possible if you used something like "Wish Upon a Star" to extend a person's life span.</br></br></br>  <br> Die from old age <br> Rez <br> Die 30 seconds later </br></br></br>  Ainz-sama, please turn me into a skeleton so I can server you.  <br>Why is it everyone always notes the Lich form affecting him but rarely the -500 on the morality scale? Just look at all the NPCs, it doesn't matter what the fuck your race is, it still affects you. We don't even know if Albedo's slutty nature would have remained if her settings were bland and left up to her racial levels.<br><br>Until we see a character who was made by their creator to be the exact opposite of themselves in personality it's rather hard to pin it down on which factor affects the person's mentality the most. And that's probably not gonna happen given the pattern in this story.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Even while doing something "good", he does so to further his own agenda. "Good" also always seems relative in his case. Think Kreya from KotOR II.</br>  <br>So volume 2 or 3 will be rushed.</br>  <br>But it's not like his agendas are actually evil. <br>His agendas is primarily to protect his guild's NPCs.<br><br>Lawful Neutral would honestly fit him better. Doing whatever good or evil in order to further his own goals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's also the possibility that the 6 Gods, 8 Kings, 13 Heroes, etc etc were transported before the server shut down as well. Considering how they only come once every 100 years, and the game lasted 10 years, all it takes is one stupid magical update along the way like an expansion pack or content patch and bam you just got databased. It could just be certain people (probably WC item owners) being transported at specific intervals. This theory would work best if say, the expansion pack released in the 4th-5th year which would trigger the 6 gods assuming they are the 1st to arrive in the new world. 1 year in yggdrasil = 100 years in new world being the formula.<br><br>Personally if we're going by 'making sense' my theory would be Ainz and everyone is just an AI copy and everything is in a contained experiment for R&amp;Ding Yggdrasil 2. But even that is way too crazy given how their VRMMOs didn't even have facial expressions. Then again, having a VRMMO and citing facial expressions as a problem already sounds retarded given our current technology.</br></br></br>  <br> a character who was made by their creator to be the exact opposite of themselves in personality <br>Huh? Hasn't it already happened with Mare? He pretends to be very timid and scared of violence, but all of the humans he's run into have realized that it's all a ruse.</br></br>  <br>I'm not quite convinced it's a ruse. I think he's just deadly serious about following orders.</br>  <br> But it's not like his agendas are actually evil. <br>Torture, casual murder and genocide are all considered evil.</br></br>  I know people say the story shouldn't have started out with the MMORPG setting but after rereading the novels, I think I disagree.<br><br>Unless there were other ways to introduce those game items in a way that it would have had an equally profound effect on the New World, I still think Yggdrasil was a pretty good setting.<br><br>If Momonga or other people were just transported from the real world a la 12 Kingdoms or even Zero no Tsukaima, what are the odds that they'd have weapons with mad power like the World Class items?</br></br></br></br>  <br>now you're just nitpicking</br>  <br>No that isn't what I meant at all. Sorry I know I worded it poorly.<br><br>What I mean is let's take Sebas or Demiurge for example. We know Sebas is not only 300 in good, but he also is affected by Touch Me who was a protector of the weak. Same with Ulbert who was a chuuni for evil and Demiurge who is 500 into evil.<br><br>Now, what would happen if these two NPCs were swapped? Sebas was created by Ulbert, but has 300 in good, and Demiurge has 500 in evil, but was created by Touch Me?<br><br>Get what I'm saying? So far all characters hold traces of their creator's personalities, which also at the same time lines up with their alignment and even race at times. As far as we know there's no exception to this.<br><br>Perhaps Spinel might be the one npc Tabula made that isn't gap moe, but who knows?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>And they are all with a few exceptions truly evil. That only makes him noble, not good.</br>  <br>I don't know</br>  <br>But he kinda does nothing but evil things like that. Could you name another three good actions to balance out these pretty obvious cases of immoral activities?</br>  <br>Not to mention Yggdrasil had many amazing fleshed out concepts that made the game look fun, even if obviously imbalanced as fuck and wouldn't be very epic for the majority of casuals as it would for AOG. Still, my favorite aspect has to be EXP being a resource. Fuck this max level / end game being the only thing that matters and everything has to be balanced around level 100s fighting each other.</br>  <br>So I am actually not nit picking at all?</br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>So papa bones is in fact evil?</br>  <br>Those aren't agendas, agendas are goals. He doesn't do genocide for genocide's sake. He's still quite evil, but his actual goals aren't that bad.</br>  <br>It's possible.</br>  <br> He saves the village <br> He saves the dryad and lets her join Nazarick <br> He allows Toile to join Nazarick <br><br>Well, obviously he's done a lot more evil than good, but here you go!<br><br>And if you claim the 1st one doesn't count because of Sebas, then all good deeds can count as the same due to it ultimately being self-satisfaction, even if it's ultimately for other's benefit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. There are a lot concepts taken from DnD and MMOs.</br>  <br>Having good goals doesn't make your actions less evil. His goal isnt even good, just that Nazarick's name gets out.</br>  <br>I didn't know shit about DnD, so I decided to try DDO. I can definitely see the similarities now.</br>  <br>Indeed. But I also think it's a lot better that it's not Yggdrasil that became reality but reality that became aspects of Yggdrasil.</br>  <br> We don't even know if Albedo's slutty nature would have remained if her settings were bland and left up to her racial levels. <br>odds are that they would have seeing as she's literally a sex demon( succubus)</br></br>    <br> sex demon( succubus) <br>She's a gorilla, anon. Embrace it.</br></br>  <br>She's the best.</br>  <br>Who says a succubus cant look like a gorilla?</br>  <br>Man, this is going to be quite the episode for secondaires.</br>  <br>Oh for sure, but I was just pointing out how if a game company were to create something close to Yggdrasil, even without the VR it would probably gather quite a lot of interest. Unlike say, shieldbro, wordmaster, SAO, etc etc you name it Yggdrasil has so many clever ass ideas rolled into one even if you don't think it would last a long time, one would be hard pressed not to try it out no?<br><br>It just screams 'fun', at least for me. Then again I'm one of those that would play EVE if it wasn't so spreadsheet simulator all the damn time so my 2 cents don't count.</br></br></br>  <br> See Albedo's Yamato Nadeshiko actions in episode 1 <br> Write her off as a bland character <br> See her "I'm the legal wife" personality in front of the other guardians. <br> Proclaim her best girl of the show. </br></br></br></br>  <br>you say that like Gorrilla and Succubus are mutually exclusive. If Solution Epsilon ca be both a Shoggoth and Ubbo-Sathla then anything is possible</br>  <br>Once you get past the swords and "magic" age, warfare is about stats.</br>  <br>Yggdrasil does have a lot of pretty fun ideas but I can't help but think everyone would rather choose a heteromorphic avatar rather than the humans and pretty soon the game would be a bunch of non-human characters pking each other.</br>  <br>Where did the gorilla thing come from anyway?</br>  <br> If Solution Epsilon ca be both a Shoggoth and Ubbo-Sathla <br>What vol was this in? I thought she was just a life eating slime</br></br>  <br>In the interlude after Ainz first meet all of them on the 6th floor, where they start arguing with each other and throwing insults for First Wife status.</br>  <br>Yeah and that's boring. Do you understand why modern warfare fiction doesn't give much attention to stories about people nuking each other all day?<br><br><br>Actually aside from specific builds like Touch-Me's banned build, Demi-humans were the meta since they took the best of both worlds, having good racials while not taking away too many job levels. Heteromorphic races were overall, the most weak in terms of meta. Plus Heteromorphic was the only race to have no penalties when you kill them in PK so for pve fags it's a huge bonus to be human or demi-human.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that it?</br>  <br>it's from her Stat sheet at the end of Vol 5</br>  <br>They're 76~ish. Or, at least Aura is.</br>  With the bitch setting gone Arbedo got changed to become a virgin<br>In volume 8 she couldn't ride her familiar (that she was able to before) because it doesn't allow a "pure" rider on it</br>  <br>huh. that's a neat little touch if true. And stop spoiling shit.</br>  <br>That's it. It's because Albedo threw out "Starfish mouth" at Shalltear and we find out why after vol 3.</br>  <br>Humans and demi-humans could obtain more job classes to choose from, while heteromorphic players were restricted by their racials. There was also less PvP penalties for killing heteromorphic players. Human and demi-human races also tended to be much prettier, which is a huge advantage in regards to player population for any MMO game.</br>  <br> In vol 9, Nazarick falls. </br>  <br> losing abilities in combat because you're no longer a slut <br><br>That's pretty amusing.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see the correlation between that single line and giving her back her hymen.</br>  <br>Tell me about your relationship with your mother.</br>  <br>Huge lie.</br>  <br>Don't listen to this fag <br><br> Herohero is killed in real life and reincarnates into a slime, meets a dragon and becomes buddies with him. Then he eats him and begins his conquest in the new world. Oh and he becomes a shota later. </br></br></br>  Look, all I'm saying is make sure everything past the current Tld chapter is spoilered for the rest of us. Please?  <br> implying such a thing is even possible </br>  <br> He already forgot world savior is in the new world <br><br>There's no game mechanics to protect your shitty tomb from being one shot.</br></br></br>  <br>The 7 headed dragon could surely do it.</br>  <br>That shit just screams succubus</br>  <br> world savior is in the new world <br>There's no proof.</br></br>  <br> the branch of tonelico <br> a mere goblin wiped out several dragons in one swing <br><br>How much harder do you want it spelled out for you?</br></br></br></br>  To all of you faggots that read the translations, Skythewood put out the prologue and chapter 1 of Vol.5 today.  <br>But it's fun to speculate and wonder how thing got to that point, spoilers make it more fun in my opinion.</br>  <br>What, we now have fans of the human kingdom and empire?<br>Thanks, anime</br></br>  <br> Bullshit, but I believe it. </br>  <br>Yup, read that like 12 hours ago.</br>  <br> Ainz-sama, it seems that to regain my combat abilities to serve you to the best of my abilities, you will have to deflower me. </br>  <br>He wouldn't buy it.</br>  <br>He'd probably just summon Pandora's Actor and tell it to get to work.</br>  <br>Wouldn't be so sure about that though. Remember that before all this stuff when he was fondling her breasts, she asks him if he's gonna take her first time right then and there.<br><br>If she no longer has certain abilities, he'd feel responsible because he'd know that it's because of the change in her programming that she lost those abilities.</br></br></br>  <br>There's 37 chapters out right now, and the release rate is around 1-2 chapters a day.</br>  <br>Your waifu got groped anon.</br>  <br>you mean a week.</br>  currently reading vol 2. Why is it so boring?  Is it Tuesday yet? <br>I'm dying here...</br>   Denpa+CoffeeFlux not even out yet <br><br>Dang, I had hope.</br></br>  <br>maybe K-On is more to your liking.</br>  <br>The guardians seem to treat their time spent guarding the tomb as their actual past, and on top of that the game didn't allow 18+ actions. I get the feeling that anything done in Yggdrasil is as car as their experiences go.</br>  <br>We've had at least 1 chapter a day this whole week, so no.</br>  <br> refusing to accept litterature you like has flaws </br>  <br>Still though, if anon is right, and she can no longer ride her familiar, it's because of the change.<br><br>Changing "Slut" to "Devoted waifu" is a pretty fucking change.</br></br></br>  <br> state something subjective <br> present no argument after <br> antagonizing posters with lel ur taste is shit :^) <br>ayyy</br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Today is the only day in the week we've gotten a chapter. And we won't get another one till next Saturday. How is that one chapter a day?</br>  <br>I think you should follow the conversation instead of posting right after you find something you think is wrong.</br>  <br>he is just the bone of his bait. why bother</br>  <br>Don't bully me</br>  <br> Denpa+CoffeeFlux not even out yet <br>You sure?</br></br>  <br>Sorry, but you killed my joke real hard.  I was just claiming another LN was related to Overlord because the protagonist becomes a slime like HeroHero and both MCs are overworked slaves of society. Amusingly enough it's almost the exact opposite of Overlord and is ridiculously comfy despite MC being just as paranoid as Ainz while he's way overpowered. </br>  I hope that the second episode has a better atmosphere to it. <br><br>For whatever reason, I found it to be lackluster in the first.</br></br>  <br><br>Does a skeleton slowpoke exist? Because we could surely use one.</br></br>  <br>Oh shit, neat-o.</br>  <br><br>Nope, All supreme beings have an special aura that all floor guardians can sense. PA turning into Ainz wouldn't fool Albedo.</br></br>    <br>wow. we actually had one.</br>  <br>Technically Ainz is a slowpoke because of based Demiurge.</br>  <br><br>Thank you kind skeletanon.</br></br>  <br> He didn't wait until next thread to respond <br><br>Thanks for fucking ruining it.</br></br></br>  <br>Things should start moving with Ainz stepping his leadership and acting the part of a lich overlord next time.</br>  <br>Praise the fucking lord.</br>  Friendly reminder that every one posting is these threads is a  little girl  's skeleton.   <br>He's definitely a solid NE.</br>  <br>That's what Ainz believes, as he doesn't possess any spells to increase someone's lifespan. He does not know how it works for him or for any of his minions.<br><br>You should know by now that Ainz isn't infallible and his knowledge is rather limited. That's why he always tries to err on the safe side.</br></br></br>   BS11 airs on Thursdays so all releases will be at least 2 days late   <br>Oh ho, that's an interesting hypothesis OP, but can he beat Lord Ainz Ooal Gown? And I'm not talking about his Dark Hero Momon persona, the one hailed as the savior of humanity. No, I'm not talking about Momonga, the one cherished as the last Supreme Being. Hell, I'm not talking about Mobonga, the literally autistic item hoarder whom every female wants a bone of either. I'm talking about the guild master and Overlord Ainz Ooal Gown with the secret Eclipse class (which is capable of the ultimate death spell capable of overcoming all resistances and immunities, The Goal of All Life is Death), his original class as a spellcaster (which grant him every D&amp;D spell imaginable like Black Hole, Call Greater Thunder, Flight, Grasp Heart, Lightning Dragon, Obsidian Sword, Reality Slash, Time Stop, True Darkness, Wall of Skeletons, Cry of the Banshee, and Shark Cyclone) and his specialized lich classes, allowing him to summon legions of Death Knights along with legendary ones like Overlord Wiseman and Grim Reaper Thanatos, armed to the teeth with divine level items and the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown (capable of instantly summoning other high level monsters), inheritor of the Treasury, his old guild mates’ ultra-high tier armor and weapons, and the World-class items within it, each possessing the power to affect the world entirely, the spell Perfect Warrior (which allows him to use arms normally beyond his scope), complete control of every inhabitant of Nazarick, his eight loyal Guardians, seven combat maids and a butler serving him, each capable of engulfing the world in darkness single-handedly if he so desired.<br><br><br>I forgot I had this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reality is hurt.</br>  <br>Reminder that a skeleton isn't inside of us, we are inside of a skeleton.</br>  <br>so does that make insects reverse skeletons?</br>  Why she is so perfect?  <br>Insects don't need their brain to survive so no. Insects are just regular skeletons.</br>  <br><br>But she still remains pure.</br></br>  <br><br> This reminds me of a short story I read as a kid about a girl could only see people and animal's bones since she was born. Like she had X-Ray vision or something. And then they somehow fix that but she doesn't recognize the people around her as her family because she remembers her family being skellingtons.<br> It spooked the shit out of me back then.</br></br></br>   &gt;yfw The throne room's world class item make copies of the guild members when activated   <br>ask tabula<br><br>he programmed her after all</br></br></br>  <br>it's kinda funny how massive Albedo's plots are when her backstory is small compared to her actual backstory which is huge, also the fact that she not important plot related.</br>  <br> The skeleton looks at the mirror <br> Is freaked out by the pulsating bag of flesh and pus inside it <br>Who REALLY has the right to be more freaked out?</br></br></br>  <br>He's an Anti-hero.<br>But really it depends on whose perspective you look at it from. Various people he's helped or saved would call him a hero, inversely his victims consider him a monster.<br>Power aside the actions of him and his organisation are no worse than any typical country (Except that most countries don't have the magic to revive people after accidentally torturing them to death, but they'd probably do it if they could).<br><br><br>Like Accelerator, he'd do anything to protect Nazarick residents but he won't go out of his to harm those who don't threaten them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We are gonna need some sauce on that story anon.</br></br>  <br>That would be depressing, even for Ainz.</br>  <br> No mention of The Legendary Forest King. <br>I'm disappointed in you.</br></br>  <br> King <br><br>No anon, I'm disappointed in you.</br></br></br>  <br> King <br> Anon..I </br></br>  <br>Can't blame her, hamsters aren't known for being smart.</br>   Supreme One not capitalized <br><br>Wow, might as well go back to funi</br></br>  <br>The true last defense.</br>  <br>He went out of his way to  commit lizardmen genocide just to teach Cocytus a lesson and get corpses. Killing that many people for such a minor reason is in no way something any quarterway decent person would do. </br>   &gt;AoG and Divine class item in OP's Shalltear fight <br><br>I hope they change this.</br></br>  <br>Saving a village just because one of his children looked unpleased at the atrocities that were being committed to helpless victims is not something someone evil would either do, as it wouldn't aid him in anyway.</br>  <br><br>Hey, dont look at me, either gave herself that silly name or some locals who were awed by her mere presence.</br></br>  How often do the Overlord LN volumes come out? Twice a year?  <br> the growth of your most treasured children that are at the same time your greatest assets is minor <br><br>By your logic, it's completely normal for someone to rise from a lowly private to supreme commander not having ever killed someone in his life directly or indirectly. After all, you just gotta train him through moar simulations!</br></br></br>  <br>Once every 4 month</br>   That ED <br>Best ED of the season. Based So Bin.</br>  <br>Do studios usually let artists just make shit like that for anime? I feel So-bin is an exception.</br>  <br>It saves Madhouse money.</br>  Currently on volume 2<br><br> mfw when the Swords of Darkness   members get dead. <br> NOOOO, God no. I liked them.  God, Clemetine's a bitch.  Man, I hate this feeling of being taken off guard. Spoil me. Do other characters like the Swords die as well? Enri? Enfrea? Gazef? </br></br></br>  <br>I'll just say, don't get attached to anyone.</br>  <br>I hope they keep saving money. I wouldn't mind if it was just a 30 min slideshow of Based So Bin's art depicting everything.</br>  <br><br>side characters have a very low survival rate</br></br>  <br>I'll let you down easy, anon.<br><br> Enri becomes a militant commander in her village because of the goblins allowing her to learn the skills of a leader.

After all, some characters who lived in the WN ended up dying in the LN instead.</br></br></br>  <br> After all, some characters who lived in the WN ended up dying in the LN instead. <br> Whoops, got my wires crossed here. Never mind, seems like Gazef is dead after all. </br></br>  <br>Swords of Darkness still lives on, happily in the WN world  ;_; </br>  <br>In the WN,  Gazef survived and Reaven died . In the LN,  Gazef died and Reaven survived. </br>  <br>Albedo arguing with Hero about why Ainz is the best ruler while Maou and Ainz discuss technology and leadership over their respective evil lairs. I want to see this.</br>  <br>Papa bones is so moe</br>  <br>More like she's yelling at Maou for even talking to Ainz.</br>  <br>It's alright anon, I chuckled.</br>  <br> My waifu, no touch. <br><br>too bad, that's not how it works, you cuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I was only pointing out that it was definitely not a minor thing, not everyone replying to you is one person anon.</br>  <br>You've got a point, she looks pretty excited about whatever she's talking to Ainz about.</br>  <br>Who is this artist? It's not Maoyuu's Akira is it? Cause Maou and Hero look way different. Actually if anything Albedo looks like Akira's style the most.</br>  <br>BASED<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His first name really should be Based So-bin from now on.</br>  <br> Not So-Based </br>  <br> implying Rubedo doesn't solo </br>  <br>Yeah Maou discussing  potatoes  with Ainz and Albedo flipping her shit at her tits while Yuusha calms her down</br>    <br><br>This would be interesting if only to see Nazarick's denizens beating living crap out of maouyuu's characters.</br></br>  <br>I dunno man. The Hero is retarded strong.</br>  <br>It's as if he's got the strength of a  world savior. </br>  Anyone got the mega link for the updated chapters? I didn't grab it when I should have.  <br>Should've posted in this thread earlier.</br>  <br>Yes, go back to the last thread and get it.</br>  <br>don't wanna. Too much work. Feed me.</br>  <br><br>Well yeah, but I just don't see him strong enough to pose a threat to any floor guardian.<br><br><br><br>alright here you go:  _______________*unzips dick*____________________ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I need an adult</br>  <br>Hero's magic can blow up entire mountains easily. I think he'd give them a good run for their money.</br>  <br><br>But can he stand against a sexually deprived Albedo who's bursting with jealousy because his Supreme One is talking with another bitch?</br></br>  <br>If that's the case, he can probably beat Shalltear, who is the strongest guardian.<br><br>He still gets wrecked by Ainz' instadeath spell and any WC weapon however.</br></br></br>  <br> JRPG hero vs JRPG villains underlings <br><br><br>it can only end one way, anon</br></br></br></br>  i hope the LN will adopt the WN part where Papa Bones tried to generate flesh or the part where he did an undead orchestra to a country..  <br> standing here </br>  <br>Shalltear is only the strongest Floor guardian if you discount PA or Albedo's WC wand/scepter</br>  <br>I wouldn't be so sure anon...</br>  <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  <br>Wrong. The guardians can interchange WCs at any time, so judging them based on it is not a good criteria. Also, PA is not a floor guardian and neither is Sebas.</br>  <br>Of course not, the more Ainz she's deprived of the greater her succubus power grows.</br>  <br>Lou Zhenhua</br>  <br> or the part where he did an undead orchestra to a country. <br><br>How much money do I need throw at the screen to see this animated?</br></br></br>  <br>Why did he do this?</br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>Eh. Victim's around, though.</br>  <br>PA guards the Treasury and is thus a Guardian( just not a floor guardian), also the 4th Floor Guardian is Stronger than Shalltear as well( though it's too stupid to leverage it's greater stats in a fight).</br>  <br>He is an Area Guardian and yes, if he copies Touch Me, he might be able to win against her. Also, Hero would wreck Gargantua, especially because it can not use WC items, so there was no point mentioning it</br>  <br>Also, if you really felt like getting nitpicky about strong NPCs, mention Rubedo or the Area Guardian of the Cherry Blossom whatever instead.</br>  Best volume so far?<br><br>3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;4</br></br>  <br>pretty much.</br>  <br>I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed volume 3. I hear volumes 6 and 9 are just as good.</br>  <br>Good. looking forward to them.</br>  <br>i liked them all basically but that looks about right</br>  <br>Volume 4 is probably the worst, although its not bad by any means. Volume 5 is a buildup volume as well, so it is not like it will be too great either (besides the sheer value of seeing Sebas BTFO'ing everyone).</br>  <br>I can agree with this.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>So we're pretty much saving the best for last. <br><br>Good, good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8 is the best. <br><br> Guardian Side stories. </br></br></br>  <br>It's true hero is the most broken character in his own series. But he technically has no-one even remotely strong to fight, so we don't really know his limits. So yeah, it's kind of hard to say.</br>  <br>No, 9  Kingdom massacre. Gazef's death </br>  <br><br>is maouyuu getting a new anime or something?</br></br>  <br>Not that I know of. Would be neat though. Are they from the same studio?</br>  <br>I wish the original anime was made using this art style from the manga instead of the LN.</br>  <br>They should have done it in the manga art style. Far more comfy, and fits Hero's personality more.</br>  <br> Might <br>Judging by how  Ainz in Touch Me's armor was facetanking her for a solid few minutes with almost no damage  I think 80% Touch Me could crush her pretty easily.</br></br>  Nice to see that Overlord is really popular in China.  <br> &gt;Ainz not lowering himself to be Jircniv subordinate/ally <br>Based LN</br></br>  <br>What are you basing that on?<br>What makes it nice? Is it that they get official translations, thus some of their money is actually getting to the author?</br></br>  <br>The real irony is China bans skeletons and all that shit, as shown when World of Warcraft's Wrath of the Lich King expansion had to undergo a complete overhaul because too many skeletons were in it. Forsaken and Scourge have always had to be changed in WoW as well so that their bones don't show.<br><br>Then again, obviously most of China's generation that reads Japanese LNs sure as hell aren't the same faggots that plague it's government.</br></br></br>  I wonder how long it will take for Sebas to rebel?  <br>As soon as Touch Me shows up.</br>  <br>That's probably why they like it. The forbidden nature of skellies makes them more attractive.</br>  <br>You don't think it'll be sooner? It's only a matter of time until he gets sick of Nazarick's generic villainy and stands up for some fleshbags.</br>  <br>I wish.<br><br>I'm merely basing it off one of the more popular  streaming  websites. Based on premier views, it's the 9th most popular show so far (got some 800K views).<br><br>Then again, there's shit like Game of Laplace and Chaos Dragon which turned out to be complete garbage, so you can expect Overlord to only go up from here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touch Me's character is already retired <br> Made an alt and got transported <br> Ages like a normal human <br> Meets Sebas <br> Both look exactly alike </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OLD MAN FIGHT OLD MAN FIGHT OLD MAN FIGHT</br>  <br> Old lady suddenly crosses the street <br> SPEEDING CARRIAGE GOING 10KMPH ON A COLLISION COURSE </br></br>  <br>I don't know why people keep posting.

The only video I can see is Gangsta, while I can't even see shit like Kuusen.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because Touch Me would be an alt. So he would first age when he's a lowbie, then slow down as he gets higher and higher. And unlike Yggdrasil leveling in new world is way harder and more time consuming.<br><br>And knowing Touch Me, not only do you gotta deal with leaving your wife and child waiting back at home, you also gotta still be the righteous superman and help everyone along the way. Oh but since you're a former guild leader you're probably not retarded so you keep a low profile at the same time if you can help it.<br><br>Add everything up and it's easy to see why.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He couldn't even if he wanted too. He needs to uphold his image as a supreme overlord. <br><br>Even if he did, Albedo (who didn't exist in the WN) would probably make Jircniv "disappear (or go nuts)," than to have her love be subordinate to another.</br></br></br>  Alright so, I watched episode 1 and read the manga.<br>Last time I was here, someone mentioned Light Novels or whatever, but I found nothing.<br>Any help?</br></br>  <br> That's because Touch Me would be an alt. <br>Only his build was fuck up, his account was fine, faggot.

The music volume is so low you can barely hear it.</br>  <br>Serves you right!</br>  Why is Maria such a titty monster?  <br><br><br>Yeah this seasons audio mixing wasn't quite as hype as it was in S2 or even S1. Part of it having to do with them getting their asses handed to them, just doesn't feel as hype when they're getting manhandled while singing their hotblooded musics</br></br></br>  <br>I've grown a lot warmer on Hibiki's song. I still don't think its quite as good as HIBIKE HIBIKE HAATO YO but then again it's really really hard to be.</br>  <br>There's already been at least two comics playing with it, so the innendo is there in Japanese even if it wasn't intended.</br>   gears get destroyed by nigger noise <br> half the show is filler and them not fighting anything <br><br>I'm getting scared just thinking about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I never noticed she was such a titty monster before. Were they upgraded or something?<br><br>We HSOTD now</br></br></br>  <br> half the show is cute SoL episodes <br>Yes please.</br></br>  <br>B96.<br><br>There's just be a lot of focus on the boobs this time around.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they were talking about the car. According to the last thread, she's saying that she'll do what she wants with Tsubasa. That's just the japanese expression for it. Technically correct line if that's the case.</br>  <br>power suits are not /m/; get this moeshit back to /a/ faggot</br>  <br>It might get even worse later on given what we know from them though, but seeing them grab the upper hand again might make up for it.<br><br><br>More SoL is always good though, especially given that G went a little too far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Their taxi got sliced in half, but on the plus side, it looks like they didn't spend too much on it.</br>  <br>She literally says she's going to do whatever she wants with Tsubasa.</br>  Can't hear the songs because of too much  noise : the episode  <br>You fucked up nerd</br>  <br>On twitter Carol's VA said things are only going to get crazier from here.</br>   Useless   <br>I like G-Beat a bit more, I think it might be my favorite Hibiki song, I just love how they repeat G-Beat one an another time.</br>      Copypaste from /m/<br><br>The Concert Tragedy and the Tachibana Family:<br> Thoughtless slander was thrown around, supported by the majority as having "sound reasoning," not because they had deduced this themselves but rather "because everyone else was saying so." At this point the true nature of the tragedy was lost and had turned into something akin to a witch hunt from the middle ages, or the barbaric persecution of Nazis, fueled by some warped sense of "justice." <br><br> turned into something akin to a witch hunt from the middle ages <br> fueled by some warped sense of "justice." <br><br>And Kaneko had said GX is another side of G.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What was up with that? They just posed and didn't even throw an attack. Only made way for Hibiki.</br>  <br>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh &lt;3</br>  <br>Same keyword<br> The darkness in people's hearts, born of a mutual misunderstanding. Having been exposed to this darkness more than most, Hibiki is still capable of believing in others. Surely this is because she knows that in the space between 2 people, there exists sunlight. <br><br>And Exterminate is about "exterminating the darkness in your heart."</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki moe in S1 <br> Chris moe in S2 <br> Tsubasa moe in S3 <br><br>OH GOD MY HEART</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's that little text on the lower left that's untranslated?<br><br><br> Stop that. </br></br></br></br>  <br>They were the cutest in the OP, nothing else matters.</br>  <br>Now that Chris and Tsubasa had their Symphogears destroyed they might play an important role. They probably won't though.</br>  <br> Surely this is because she knows that in the space between 2 people, there exists sunlight. <br>So there's a Miku between every one of us?  Dammit Kaneko, your metaphors are overlapping. </br></br>  <br>Considering Blue wasn't in the castle with Carol, I'd wager she's either going for them or Miku+bakas.</br>  Shirabe arc soon. I hope.  <br>Yeah, Tusbasa's is the best. The others' aren't bad, but they aren't half as good as G's.</br>  Matching  <br>Guess this will be all about Carol and Hibiki finding their own justice amongst their twisted pasts.</br>  <br>Ha, yeah I'm surprised it wasn't brought up in the last thread.</br>  <br>It would be damn nice if they both got some time in the spotlight.  I'm not looking forward to them singing prematurely without LiNKER and suffering horribly as a result though. </br>  <br>By the end maybe they'll swap places. Hibiki goes nuts and tries to tear the world down and Carol works with the geahs to stop her.</br>  <br>They'll force themselves to battle even while low on drugs since Tsubasa and Chris have damaged relics and Maria's is broken from the start. Can't leave Hibiki alone who's having a breakdown and refusing to fight after all.</br>  <br>Airgetlam obviously gets repaired. Now that more Gears are broke, more repairs.</br>  <br>Sure, but repairs take time. They wouldn't just remove a fundamental battle asset from them as a cliffhanger only to give them back said asset right at the next episode. No, they'd surely never do something like that. That would be insane.</br>  <br>This show is insane. They suplex spaceships.</br>  <br>If that means Maria (and Hibiki too, I guess) getting to save the day and be heroes, bring it on</br>  <br>I really hope they don't do this again.</br>  Can Rorona beat up Carol in a fist fight?<br><br> Atelier Carol when? </br></br>  <br>Don't forget they also surfed missiles and punched mountains just before the spaceship suplex, and all in less than five minutes.</br>  S1 <br> I don't want you to hide anything from me <br> Okay, I'm not hiding anything except this terrible state secret and will continue acting suspicious like a husband having an affair <br>G<br> I don't want you to fight <br> Thank you but I'm gonna fight anyway <br>GX<br> Okay, go and come back safely <br> Sorry, I was being a retard and got BTFO <br>Why does Hibiki just keep shitting on Miku's feelings like that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why was Hibiki so useless this episode?  <br>Adventurer Rorona probably could.  I'm still pissed that ending isn't canon. Fuck that "true ending" bullcrap. </br>  <br>Because Hibiki is trying to pray away the gay but Miku won't let her.</br>  <br>Obligatory MC moralfaggotry</br>  <br>Being Miku is eternal suffering</br>  <br>Hibiki is weak to lolis. Remember how soundly Shirabe was able to verbally thrash her.</br>   There won't be a gungnir datto   <br>Just wait for  zombie Kanade .</br>  Who reacts this way to loli legs?  <br>Since when biki can survive explosions without gear?</br>  <br>Since she started eating, watching movies, and sleeping.</br>  <br>Her clothes barely got messed up.</br>  Can't wait to see Maria's face when Shirabe/Kirika join the battle without LiNKER and spill JAM all over the place.  <br> There won't be an ANIME JA NAI </br>  <br>Carol is the little yappy dog who barks a lot but is pretty ineffective on her own.</br>  <br>That whole scene was pretty ridiculous. And it had a cliffhanger building up to it.</br>  I can tell that Maria is going to be badass and useful this season.  <br>It's kind of bullshit. She blew a massive crater into the ground and Hibiki came out of it mostly unscathed.</br>  <br>Serena please.</br>  <br>Biki was only missing Yamcha pose there.</br>  <br>That's how magic works.</br>  <br>Objectively speaking, Miku'd be much more happier if she just leaves Hibiki and goes her own way. All Hibiki ever did is selfishly taking advantages of her kindness.</br>  <br>Useful for breeding.</br>  <br>Actually that one is guaranteed since that's her line in the character introduction page on the official site.</br>  Is there a pastebin or something for all the character songs from S1 and G?  <br>Ver pls</br>  <br>I'd laugh if they actually use her as bait for Ver since they need LiNKER.</br>  <br>Carol wasn't trying to kill her. She needed Hibiki to put her gear on.</br>  <br>Miku probably blames herself for what happened to Hibiki since she sent her to the concert alone.</br>  <br>Shouldn't they have better sync rates because of Xdrive, anyway?</br>  <br>what the fuck is on kirikas butt?</br>  <br> explosives <br>Carol is out to destroy the gears themselves, so she wouldn't kill Hibiki without having destroyed that first.<br><br><br>They're on Nyaa or Jpopsuki, or other places. There's no reason for links to be put into a Pastebin.</br></br></br></br></br>  Garie best doll  Miku needs to join enemy once again so she can get that kissing skill and use it on Hibiki.  <br>Setting aside the fact that you're a dumbass for not paying attention to what board you were on, doesn't that logic mean toku isn't /m/ either?</br>  <br>Chuuni fashion</br>  <br>Using that harmless excavation alchemy.<br><br>In all seriousness, it was earth element, check the symbol in the OP. She just ripped the ground up and threw Hibiki up into the air. Which you'd expect to be really dangerous but maybe not so much as an actual explosion.</br></br></br>  <br>Aren't they the first druggies who went X-drive? The others are all natural right?</br>  <br>That would be interesting. Nana did say that  Exterminate  was the song that would destroy the world. So the OP with all the geahs jumping to fight Carol always be a bait-in-switch with them fighting Hibiki in the actual finale to get her out of a funk (with that playing in the background naturally),<br><br> Or we get a Jojo-esque world reset ending with a new reincarnated cast of characters to replace the gears of the first world. </br></br></br>  <br>Garie is trash.</br>  <br>Wouldn't killing Hibiki get rid of her Gear too?</br>  <br>Clearly someone on the staff wants doujins where Kirika has a buttplug tail.</br>  <br>Fine really beat the shit out of her while she wasn't wearing her gear in S1E12.</br>  <br>Best trash.</br>  <br>It almost looks like she peed herself.</br>  <br>Killing Hibiki would be killing a person able to use the gear, not the gear itself.<br><br><br>FIS were first XDrives besides the 3 main girls, yeah. I would assume that going XDrive would ensure that they were compatible without having to resort to Linker, and nobody knows this just because they weren't legally allowed to use their gears.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems like it doesn't count unless the relic is activated. She wouldn't demand Hibiki transform otherwise.</br>  <br>She had the excuse of being a Relic hybrid to take that pounding.</br>  <br>Let's... not get carried away</br>    <br> The only one I like really is Tsubasa's <br><br>G-Beat is the most hyped battle song to date.</br></br></br>  <br>Radiant Force being the best song so far aside, Hibiki's is great, Chris' is good, and Tsubasa' is  shit </br>  <br> My dick </br>  <br><br>I guess some people need reminding<br><br>BEST DOLL POWERANKING<br><br>Blue &gt; POWERGAP &gt; Red &gt; Green &gt; POWERGAP &gt; Yellow</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Don't mind me, just fondling breasts  <br>Dolls are shit.

They're separate creations.</br>  <br>The first one is a stretch.<br>It's based off a late period European fencer, not a samurai.<br>Look at that classy jacket, and the thrusting sword.<br><br>The third one is just not there. Sorry mate.<br>You're comparing a baby boar/slug thing to cockroaches.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>damn, the new noise look slick</br>  <br> yfw you realize that in G Hibiki hit Miku more than she did anyone from FIS </br>  Up or down?  <br>Heaven is best. Heaven is paradise.</br>  <br>Neither. Team Kato or bust.</br>  I don't know from where they are, but I'm going to say the bottom one.  right  Utaha-senpai of course.  Bottom  <br>Eriri</br>  <br><br>Good choice. She has the perfect body.</br></br>  <br>I like Eriri.</br>   no love for the cousin   <br>worse than eriri</br>  <br>Well, of course she is worse than the best.</br>  <br>she is shit too</br>  <br> the best <br><br>Certainly doesn't have the best body.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>them legs.. I'm sold.</br>  Eriri is literally a bad Chitoge knock-off.  <br><br>Yeah. She doesn't even have tits. At least Chitoge had a good pair.</br></br>  eriri a shit and a dumb name  How come we don't have back to back threads like Yahari?  <br>Wasn't Chitoge already a knock-off herself? I mean I'm Team Chitoge but Nisekoi is cliche haven.</br>  <br><br>No LN translation. If you want I'll start Saekano threads everyday for a week and we'll see if we can get a general going.</br></br>  <br> no LN translation <br>Are you sure? https://saekanothetranslation.wordp<wbr>ress.com/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Down by far</br>  <br>this</br>  <br><br>Too slow.</br></br>  <br> Long hair vs twintails <br> Tits vs dfc <br> Classic tsundere vs meta tsundere <br> knock-off <br>I've seen some trolling.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why settle for the flat chested girl if you can get the titty monster?  <br>Because flat chested girls are objectively better.</br>  <br>Would you prefer a shitty MTL?  Steel was sick too and he just got better. </br>  <br><br>Yahari has fast and good translations. That's why they get to have 24/7 generals.</br></br>  I can't wait for next season. I don't read the LNs and I don't know what happens in them but I want to see Utaha-senpai win next season.  <br>Good for Spyro, but I'm sure luck is on his side for that.</br>  Can someone tell me why Megumi goes along with his nonsense? She doesn't even know him and she does every time consuming and boring thing he asks. For what purpose?  <br><br>So do I.</br></br>  <br> meta tsundere </br>  <br>I don't disagree.</br>  <br><br>Because she loves him, silly.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember whether it's she's lonely or she likes him or both.</br>  <br>Read vol.8. She's grown too attached to the circle.</br>  <br>Utaha. Megumi is best girl overall though.</br>  <br>The one on the right, obviously.</br>  <br>I'd say this is exactly the moment in which she seals her victory. There is nothing greater than an emotional meeting that heals his broken heart.</br>    Down  <br>Up, up, and awaaaaaay!<br> Into Eriri full force, aw yeah. </br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt. <br><br> Eriri a shit. </br></br>   picking either <br> not picking literal perfection </br>    <br>There is only one answer. My goddess Eriri.</br>  <br> green panties <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> Not living in moderation </br>  Most people are going to pick down or the plain slut<br><br>I like up but I know these threads are only for shitposting so my opinion doesn't matter<br><br>I'm out this bitch, pce</br></br></br></br>  I've masturbated to this so many times.  <br><br>You better not have fapped to Megumi. She's supposed to be pure.</br></br>   Doubting perfection   <br><br>We never did.</br></br>  <br> generic tsundere #1023039913231876 <br> perfection </br></br>  <br>I never did though.</br>  <br>I love this meme</br>  <br> meme </br>  <br><br>It's not a meme. If someone were to ask another person to describe Eriri's character, the most they could say is that she's a tsundere. That's not perfection.</br></br>  <br>See pic related<br><br><br>IF someone were to ask me to describe Eriri's character, I would say that she's the best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a good way to discredit yourself. I like it.</br>  <br> IF someone were to ask me to describe Eriri's character, I would say that she's the best girl. <br><br>And you would be wrong. Her character development pales in comparison to the rest of the cast's.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And if I happen to be a tsundere enthusiast? Why can't I like what I like instead of having people shit all over it? If someone likes eating shit then let them eat shit.</br></br>  <br>"A formerly dependent and weak girl slowly growing into a strong-willed artist who's more at ease with herself around others" is probably what Maruto expected people to think of Eriri. It was kinda the point of GS and vol 8.<br><br><br>Eriri and Tomoya are two characters who have developed the most though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eriri is third place, first is Tomoya since the series is from his POV and second is pic related. Of course, all the character development in this series is great.</br></br>  <br>I want to know nips opinion about this development. Because if people turn to hate her even more, it will become an irony.</br>  <br><br>Eriri is still weak and selfish. <br><br> thinks Tomoya doesn't hold a grudge against her anymore <br> thinks she still has a say in who joins the circle despite leaving <br> still self-conscious about Izumi and how she might surpass her <br><br>And then there's this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Utaha <br> Generic harsh kuudere sepnai #1831823 <br> Megumi <br> Generic normal and dull boring girl #1238123 </br></br></br></br>  <br> Megumi <br> Generic normal and dull boring girl #1238123 <br><br>Nice bait. That's Onodera you're describing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has a severe superiority complex.</br>  <br>Megumi hasn't developed that much. She's largely been the same since vol 6, pushing herself too hard to be someone she isn't.<br><br><br>They don't hate her (not like what we have here anyway), and some even think Eriri might win in the end because Maruto has reset her and Tomoya's relationship (basically they speculate there might be another vol 6 all over again).</br></br></br></br>  <br> pushing herself too hard to be someone she isn't. <br><br>How is she doing that? Her relationship with Tomoya is the most natural one in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Out of the three principal girls, Eriri is dead last in terms of popularity.</br>  <br> Eriri might win in the end because Maruto has reset her and Tomoya's relationship (basically they speculate there might be another vol 6 all over again). <br><br>But that's not possible. If Eriri wins then her career as an artist over. If anything, she might give up on Tomoya romantically in a couple of volumes like Utaha did.</br></br></br>  <br> bait <br>It's not bait when it describes her to a tee.</br></br>  <br> Eriri is still weak and selfish <br>She is a flawed character but still the best.</br></br>  <br><br>She's only normal and dull if you're completely blind. Does this look anything like "dull?"</br></br>  <br>Speaking of Utaha, is her spinoff canon?</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>It is bait when it describes your post to a tee.</br>  <br> pales in comparison <br> Literally is one, if not is the most developed girl before volume 7 <br>Disliking tsundere doesn't mean you can make up horseshit, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a rhetorical question?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br>Then you are blind.</br></br>  Best  <br>That's shame. I thought it was perfect prequel for her and morals-kun.</br>  <br><br>Eriri's development is good, great even. But it's just not the best. She is still a bitch.</br></br>  <br>What's the problem? Eriri has always been a balance of strong and weak. That one of her main appeals. Removing either one for the other entirely isn't good for her. Eriri's resolve and goals have evolved, that's the change in her. Her strong mentality towards those objectives that makes her stubborn remains, but she isn't as full of pride as she used to be and can apologize for her mistakes as seen in volume 6.</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, and Eriri isn't a tsundere, amirite?</br></br>  <br>She's become very controlling so the circle won't fall apart, but it's not who she really is. Iori comments on that in vol 8.<br><br><br>It's possible because Tomoya says someday he might understand creators like Eriri and become like them too. But yeah I don't see it happening before Maruto wraps everthing up unless he pulls another "5 years late".</br></br></br></br>  <br> bitch <br>Not to Tomoya. She still fights with Utaha and that is a good thing.</br></br>  <br> she isn't as full of pride as she used to be and can apologize for her mistakes as seen in volume 6. <br><br>Then why does she need Tomoya to get her to apologize to Megumi?</br></br></br>  <br>*later</br>  <br><br>Utaha is her closest ally.</br></br>  <br>Eriri is a cookie-cutter generic tsundere with nothing that makes her stand out among the large pool of existing tsunderes.</br>  <br>Eh your words are too good to her. It's Tomoya idea, so she basically stand there doing nothing.</br>  <br> She's become very controlling so the circle won't fall apart <br><br>That was mainly because of Tomoya's screw-up in volume 6. Eriri and Utaha would have left whether or not Megumi was in the circle. <br><br> Iori comments on that in vol 8. <br><br>Is that when he called her 重い?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Explain why you think Megumi is "boring."</br></br>  <br>Because neither Eriri nor Megumi is willing to do anything about it.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, and if Eriri learned her lesson in volume 6 then she'd know that she should apologize. But nope, she doesn't because she's scared. Even in volume 7 when Megumi confronts her she tries to excuse herself by saying that Megumi left too.</br></br>  <br>I assume Megumi is first and Utaha second, right?<br><br>If so, Japan has pretty damn good tastes for once.</br></br></br>  <br>He screwed up since vol 1. That's why he's trying to do things differently this time.</br>  <br>Megumi is a cookie-cutter generic normal girl with nothing that makes her stand out among the large pool of existing normal girls.<br><br><br>You first. Explain your meme.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty clear in vol 8 that Eriri is more friendly to Megumi than the other way around. Given their situation, it makes more sense for a third party like Tomoya to arrange something for them.</br>  <br><br><br>What are you guys talking about? Why would Eriri or anything between her and Megumi need apologizing for? Isn't the deal between then all just one big misunderstanding with each side thinking the other might not consider the other as friends anymore? It's not like either one dislikes each other. Eriri in particular is pessimistic and Megumi is lonely enough to miss her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Megumi is a bit snarky, she's not afraid to speak her mind. She's also passionate considering she picked up programming so that she could be useful to the circle. She's a nice girl that cares for her friends a lot, but she's also assertive and actually gets mad when she's wronged. <br><br>And that's just off the top of my head. Your average normal girl is like Onodera who I can only describe as a moeblob.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There aren't even many girls similar to Megumi, and much less as main girls of a harem series. <br><br>Eriri is literally a carboncopied character. The author didn't even have to try come up with her personality or design.</br></br></br>  Up and Down<br>And in the end it's only round and round and round<br><br>Haven't you heard it's a battle of words<br>the poster bearer cried<br><br>Listen son, said the man with the gun<br>There's room for you inside</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Megumi and Eriri don't understand each other since one is a creator and the other isn't. Even Tomoya said that Eriri should apologize to Megumi during their webchat.</br></br>  <br>Eriri was the one who abandoned the circle and didn't even have the decency of telling Megumi about it. The most she could muster up was telling her via Tomoya, but that's still pretty shitty from her.</br>  <br><br>I know right. Could a single person here name a girl like Megumi?</br></br>  <br>Tsundere can behave differently and have different personality drives. It doesn't mean they aren't "generic" by their archetype. Megumi was made with the model of your typical normal/dull/plain/boring girl. The author's twist is to spin it so she is the main girl, which is rare since those types are very rarely main girls. They usually are background or secondary heroines <br><br><br> Don't explain and support why <br> I'll just keep calling her that <br>Nice. And with that, your post is as valid as mine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Megumi was made with the model of your typical normal/dull/plain/boring girl <br><br>Except she is not plain or boring at all. That was only Tomoya's initial vision of her because he was too dense to realize her true beauty. In a way, it's meta commentary. Someone dense wouldn't realize how great of a girl she is, but someone who actually paid attention would see her true value. Look at her now, does she seem "boring?"</br></br></br>  <br>As of the current volume? She's not as interesting as she was before that's for sure.</br>  All around  <br><br>Why? We're finally seeing her darker side.</br></br>  <br>Your post isn't even valid at all. Eriri is a checklist on every popular cliche a tsundere can have<br> popular <br> talented <br> special snowflake <br> half gaijin <br> childhood friend <br> cartoonish, telegraphed tsundere act that is obvious to everyone but the MC <br><br>She's so generic it hurts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know it is bad when even the anime reuses her scenes in two different episodes.</br>  <br>That's honestly not what makes her interesting as a character though, and that's just a result of her overexerting herself. She's a nice girl through and through, which is probably why the whole "dark Megumi" is treated like a running gag.</br>  <br> that pantsu line </br>  <br>More or less, she still keeps to her archtype. Megumi barely changed, she's still generally indifferent and dull for lacking exciting attributes in spite of taking interest in making games. And jokes about her being scary means little since they are exaggerations and not her actual character. <br><br><br> Dull <br> Average <br> Doesn't stand out <br> Plain and simple but super beauty when get noticed <br> Typically the nice girl MC befriends <br> Fills quota for normal girl <br>Megumi is generic as it gets.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> which is probably why the whole "dark Megumi" is treated like a running gag. <br><br>Only about half the time. Volume 7 angry Megumi wasn't a joke.</br></br></br>  <br> indifferent <br> dull <br> lacking exciting attributes <br><br>These are all lies. She is anything but indifferent. Even in S1, it's obvious that she cares about the game just as much as Tomoya does. When Tomoya betrayed her trust in volume 6, she was genuinely angry. Someone indifferent wouldn't do that. And really, does this look like someone indifferent?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her being angry and her being an insincere (which what they joke about in vol 8) are completely different things.</br>  <br><br>Megumi wasn't insincere in volume 7. She was just angry Tomoya neglected her in the game.</br></br>   This thread <br>I see Megumifags are delusional about their oh so super unique and original girl. And of course starting shit.</br>  <br>Actually the whole "average girl that isn't really average" gimmick is pretty unique. Far less generic than a tsundere being tsundere for the sake of being tsundere.</br>  <br><br>It took you long enough to show up, Eririfag. Always starting shit up as usual.</br></br>  <br>It isn't their fault she's a much fresher character compared to the walking stereotypes surrounding her.</br>  <br> Gets called out <br> Trying to shift the blame <br>Megumifags as usual.<br><br><br> Muh excuse for shitposting </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said she was insincere in vol 7. I only said the joke they throw around about Megumi in vol 8 is about her being a deceitful person.</br>  <br><br>You're the only who got called out, Eririfag, for your awful shitposting against Megumi.</br></br>  <br> shitposting <br><br>More like you can't handle the banter. Everything must be a super serious argument for you Eririfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, but I can't remember Megumi being deceitful. She seems like an honest girl to me.</br></br>  Aren't we all friends here?  <br>The others joke that Megumi seems like a nice person on the outside but is actually the scheming type (like Michiru saying she kicked out Eriri and Utaha).</br>  <br>This is an all-out battlefield where only the strongest wins.</br>  <br>You're the one getting called out, delusional Megumifag.<br><br><br>Banter would mean it's lighthearted and not serious. It is always serious and rage worthy for you Megumifags. See this thread and all the other times you guys started shit first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So best cake Akane?</br>  <br>Threads without the Eriri defense force are very lighthearted though.</br>  <br> Saekano threads without Eriri <br><br>Why...would such threads exist...?</br></br></br>  <br>More like any threads without Megumifags shitposting is a nice thread.</br>  <br> ... <br> ... <br>Eririfags, everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>You should ask that to the fans. We've had a handful of nice threads without a single Eririfag posting.<br><br><br>But Eririfags are the biggest shitposters in the fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure what you're implying but the periods can be used in that matter.</br>  <br>No. LNfags and even Tomoya himself has noted and said that Megumi's typical persona is being indifferent. Megumi having some moments where she reacts doesn't change the fact her general disposition is indifference.<br><br><br> pretty unique <br>What is it, variants of Cinderella or ugly duckling? Not really at all. Less common still means generic.<br><br><br>Honestly, it they wouldn't as obnoxious and combative if they could just accept that Megumi is in the same boat as the others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> biggest shitposters <br>That's Megumifags, being the worst shitposters for exactly the stated reasons.</br></br>  <br> Cinderella or ugly duckling <br>See, you have to look outside even Japanese media to find a plausible comparison. The point about her being unique, refreshing and innovative for a harem series still remains. You don't have to try so hard to deny that fact and imply she is anywhere near as generic as the typical tsundere and kuudere that you can see better executed in other VN/LN/manga/anime.</br></br>  <br>Kosaki</br>  <br> this Eririfag in denial is at it again </br>  <br> No. LNfags and even Tomoya himself has noted and said that Megumi's typical persona is being indifferent. <br><br>That's only her outside appearance. Once you get to know her even a little bit, you'll see how she is anything but indifferent. Tomoya is dense, anyone he can't pigeonhole as something like a tsundere or kuudere is flat according to him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Megumifags don't shitpost. They only call out other people, namely Eririfags, on their shit..</br></br>  <br>Kosaki is nothing like Megumi.<br><br>First of all, since the start of this series you already see Megumi doing things that Kosaki will never be able to in her whole life, like engaging in a completely casual yet bold conversation with the MC without dropping her spaghetti or flustering like a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she's not in the same fucking boat, no matter how hard you spin it. <br><br> b-b--but she's just like Kosaki <br>Which is fucking bullshit because one is a spaghetti incarnate and the other one is a calm and collected person. Okay, the calm one might be debatable, but you get the gist of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Megumifags are the worst. They are worse than Senafags who at least admit to shitposting due to heir hate for Yozora.<br><br><br>Keep proving my point, shitposter.<br><br><br> Militant posting throwing shit/worst/attacking Eriri unprovoked <br> don't shitpost.  <br>Delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you replying to yourself? It's funny how there's always two mysterious posters always agreeing with each other but in other threads there isn't even one.<br><br>Your bait won't work here.</br></br></br>  <br> discussing characters = attacking </br>  Has there ever been a Saenai thread that actually discussed the show? Not just non-stop funposting and best girl arguments.   you will never be as angry as Eririfags   <br><br>Saekano threads frequently discuss the characters, Contrast to Yahari threads which is nothing but faggotry.</br></br>  <br>How can Sena &gt; Yozora not be a fact?</br>  <br>Yeah. For example, see the recent volume 8 threads. Coincidentally, barely any Eririfags were seen and thus the threads were nice.</br>  <br>A lot, mainly ones without eririfags barging in and being so fucking angry. You can check the vol.8 spoiler thread in the archive for example.</br>  <br> Anyone who disagrees is samefag <br>Typical Megumifag. There was another two Eririfags you replied to who wasn't me. Stay mad.<br><br><br>How is any of that discussing character? <br><br><br> What is opinions <br>Worst fans alright.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> another two Eririfags <br><br>Who also happen to share your writing style and argumentation. How rare.</br></br></br>  <br> How is any of that discussing character?  <br> half the thread is discussing Eriri's character development </br></br>  <br>Just ignore him.</br>  <br>Down. So damn hard.</br>  <br>Man, I thought Yahari threads would get better after the anime ended, and oh boy how wrong I was.</br>  <br>Prove it.<br><br><br>Nice red herring ignoring shitposts that isn't discussing. You can't deny Megumifags flaming and starting shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I once tried going into one of the threads. It was pretty much nothing but reposts and the same shit over and over again. At least Saekano threads are relatively fresh.</br></br>  <br> Prove it <br><br>Your use of greentext gives you away. Also certain typos.</br></br></br>    Eriri is for anyone who was bullied as a kid and bothered by it.<br>The cousin is for healthy young men.<br>Megumi is for the inactive but politically motivated (may overlap with Eriri).<br><br>Utaha is too perfect for the existing.<br><br>Source: Me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>The spoiler thread had fuck all discussions. Just people posting selective stuff from the summary and playing guessing games on what's going on.</br></br>   <br>At least Yuckynofags aren't as smug, arrogant and stuck-up as they used to be before the second season started. </br>   <br><br>Eririfags make baseless shitposts against Megumi unprovoked. They always start shit with Megumifags. Megumifags actually put thought into their criticism of Eriri.</br></br>  <br>Haha no. Saekano threads are basically infested by the same people who watch Ore Shura or Color Wars. This thread suffers the same shit that all Saekano threads do, with posting about how Megumi is the best, Eriri is the best, etc. It's all repeats.</br>  <br><br>I loved that thread the other day where Yuckynofags got BTFO. They always delude themselves into thinking that THK exists and that anyone who doesn't like Yuckyno is him.</br></br>  <br>Quote them, delusional Megumifag.<br><br><br> baseless shitpost <br> unprovoked <br> always start shit <br>Literally Megumifags to Eriri.<br> thoughts into their criticism <br>Yeah sure, just calling her worst, shit, or bitch is really thoughtful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speculation and talks based on new information ARE discussion. It's too obvious that Eririfags don't even care about the series and only come to the threads for the waifuwars. Otherwise it's all calm and nice without them.</br>  <br><br>Except when people praise Megumi, they praise her character and there's always something new and fresh in it. The other fans just talk about how their girl makes their dick hard.</br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br> Yeah sure, just calling her worst, shit, or bitch is really thoughtful. <br><br>Which is always accompanied by information from the text or anime. Eririfags can't criticize Megumi without making shit up.</br></br></br>  <br>The bottom is mine. Keep trying, Megumifag.</br>  <br>That's still a discussion. Fucking hell anon, half of the content of this board is people speculating shit.</br>  I would never be able to stop.  <br>Sure, you fooled me and you're right.</br>  <br>Both Megumifags and Eririfags are pretty bad man.</br>  <br>Megumifags are truly the worst.</br>  <br>The difference being that Eririfags are the determining factor of a thread being good or bad.</br>  <br>Eririfags are truly the worst.</br>  <br>There's a difference between speculating based on strong evidence and speculating based on speculations. Many things we "discuss" here wouldn't even exist if the novels were readily available for everyone to read.</br>  <br> always accompanied by information from the text or anime <br>Hardly so bullshit and you know it. Even haters try, it it is barely well supported. <br><br><br>Still shifting the blame. Fucking typical. This is one reason why Megumifags are the worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Many things we "discuss" here wouldn't even exist if the novels were readily available for everyone to read. <br><br>Okay fine, if there's anything you need clarification on I'd be happy to translate that portion.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't need to shift the blame when Eririfags give themselves a bad reputation with their attitude. You're digging your own hole even further.</br>  <br>Congratulations, Megumifag. Your constant shifting of blame despite your miltiant attitude and samefag accusation are just half the reason why you give Megumifags a bad rep.</br>  <br>Congratulations, Eririfag. Your constant deflection of the blame despite the undeniable history of these threads is just half the reason why you give Eririfags a bad rep.</br>  <br>The best part was when Yuifags and Irohafags entered the thread and that poor Yukinoshitter couldn't even keep up with the pace of the amount of shit coming against him.</br>  <br> history of these threads <br>Anyone who lurked Saenai threads since the start knows damn well the of the shitstorm between Megumifags and Eririfags. The truth of the matter underneath the surface lies in the fact Megumifags are obnoxious fans and the worst shitposter for their constant provocations, but never accept what the blame for ruining making threads go shit. This thread is a testament to that, mostly thanks to you.</br></br>  <br>LN pages and brief translation are available though, it's not like every shit posted here is pure speculation.</br>  <br><br>Explain why threads with only Megumifags go smoothly but add in an Eririfag and everything goes to shit.</br></br>  <br>Eririfags are up in arms all the time and try to drag Megumifags on in their shit when someone shitposts Eriri. <br><br> someone insults Eriri <br> u must be a megumifag, megumifags a shit <br><br>And that's how shit starts in every thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You must be lurking different threads then. You fags are always the most combative and insecure since dawn. <br><br>Jesus Christ, you fags were even bawling like mad when you found out Eriri was not as popular as you'd like to think</br></br></br>  <br>Because Megumifags can't avoid not shitposting, obviously.<br><br><br>Megumifags did that first and that all the time whenever someone insults Megumi. Eririfags did it back, so Megumifags can't complain when they started it. When you add that on top of typically starting shit and thoughtless shitposting, it's no wonder why Megumifags are terrible<br><br><br>This isn't bizzaro world. Megumifags are insecure and combative, if they wouldn't then we would have nice threads.<br><br> bawling <br>Link or you're full of shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because Megumifags can't avoid not shitposting, obviously. <br><br>Or we can be reasonable and assume that they actually discuss the series and it's the Eririfags who start the shitposting.</br></br></br>  <br> Megumifags <br> reasonable <br> not shitposting at the mere sight of Eriri <br>Thanks for the laugh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you want to talk about who did it first, then Eririfags are undeniably the ones to blame for everything. During the first week there were barely any Megumifags, and Eririfags already had this combative and militant attitude towards everyone.<br><br>And stop making shit up. Eririfags never add anything of value to the threads. It's always the other fans discussing shit civilly and Eririfags only meddle in when it's time to defend Eriri, and not even in good mood. It's always calling eveyone haters o Megumifags and having the waifu glasses on. The threads would be much better without posters of your kind.</br></br></br>  <br>  During the first week there were barely any Megumifags <br> episodes 2 and 3 air <br> majority of fanbase is Megumifags <br> last episode airs <br> Megumifags have completely taken over the fanbase <br><br>Has there ever been anything like this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Eririfags <br> reasonable <br> not shitposting at the mere sight of negative opinions on their waifu <br>Thanks for the laugh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Middle a best.</br>  <br>Everyone was against Megumi during the very first week the episode 0 aired. Your point is moot. The real waifu wars between Eririfags and Megumifags didn't started until the second week. <br><br> stop making shit up <br>Apply yourself. This thread is typical and you can't deny it no matter how hard you want to.<br><br><br>Funny, Megumifags do the same too. Add that to the list why they're the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so. Most harems have some balance between fans of the principal girls. Especially when a new girl is introduced and steals some fans from the former girls.</br>  I don't quite understand the logic of this girl's outfit.  <br>Slutfits can be practical</br>   fine with the shitty metal crotch playbunny girl thing <br> not fine with this <br><br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>When did I say that?</br>  <br>She starts off being an ice queen bitch but turned dere after some white knightings from Adlet.  Bunny and Adlet still had better chemistry if not Adlet getting brainwashed to love and protect Fremy. </br>    OTP  <br>There is no logic to it. Just get hard and fap to it you mindless otaku scum!</br>  <br>I can't even fap to her silly outfit.</br>   Tgurneu  <br>How would you pronounce his name?<br> Tch-gu-neo ? </br></br>  <br>It's cool and spicy</br>   If this nigga don't shut the fuck up   <br> logic <br>it's fashion, aint gotta explain shit</br></br>  Is it really that weird to eat carrots raw?  <br>Weird for a princess</br>  <br>I'd bet she'd eat Adlet's carrot raw, eh?</br>  <br>This scene pissed me off. <br><br> Touts himself as strongest <br><br>Then whines when he is bested</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touts himself as strongest <br> Then whines when he is bested <br>That's kind of how it works when you're an asshole, or reminded that you're not as strong as you let yourself out to be.</br></br></br>  <br>Strongest MAN.</br>  <br>He's mad because she suddenly started fighting him even though they can't risk injuring one another. Adlet might not be the strongest of the braves, but he sure as hell is stronger than Nashetania</br>  <br>Is this not the face of manliness?</br>  <br> Stronger than Nashetania <br>Not even close, hes by far the weakest of all the braves and needs constant reviving</br></br>  <br>This is how I predict it happening.<br><br> She was innocent, the musket ball that was found was a stray shot fired while defending herself, it just happened to kill the shit out of another one of the heroes that we'll only likely see in a flashback, because guns kill, kids. But she was blamed for the murder, even though the real killer that was trying to kill her and the victim, of course because she didn't kill the serial killer, they are still very much loose, and still trying to kill the remaining heroes. <br><br> She is a wreck because she murdered an innocent, her pride and honor taken from her as being the best shot, the mark itself being a farce because she killed something other than the demons. She sides with animals because she's too afraid to betray her own kind again with lead justice. <br><br>Ignore my theorycrafting, I'm just going on typical anime tropes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is bunny really a slut bitch?

Fuck, I didn't expect something from that show in a thousand years.</br>  <br>I think this is pretty normal. And I think nothing can compare to the emptyness I felt when I finished the final season.</br>  <br>I went in to Idolmaster unspoiled. <br>20 hit me like a nip cold</br></br>  Tokyo Ghoul Root A was shit but this ED card made me cry because it made me remember the manga panels. Holy shit, Yoshimura didn't deserve that.  <br>Probably during Chuu2 and Sakurasou. Neither of those shows were particularly sad, but the graduation scene in Sakurasou was a killer. In Chuu2 they started delving into Rikka's psyche and the reasoning behind her chuunibyou towards the end of the first season. That along with the bike scene that followed really came out of nowhere.<br><br>The sudden serious tone switch during episode 2 of Angel Beats! and 12 of Welcome to the NHK were pretty surprising as well.<br><br>Now that I think about it, that reveal in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, although hinted rather obviously early on, really surprised me and hit me hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  Read the guide buyfag.moe  <br><br>I got pretty fucked over by the EMS shipping, actually.

She is still the true heroine of the novel tho.</br>  <br>Stay delusional.<br><br>Sakura is not the heroine of Heaven's Feel. She is simply a plot device/villain made to keep the story moving forward. She does not do anything worth calling her a heroine. Yes, she does in fact have sex with Shirou, not because she is the heroine, but because she is the love interest, two different things. This is also something that sets HF apart from Fate and UBW, the heroine and love interest are not the same person, like Saber or Rin.<br><br>You probably already guessed who the heroin of HF is, but before that you might be wondering, "Why did Nasu choose make the heroine and love interest in HF different but not in the other routes? He certainly had choices between rider, Caster, Ayako, Taiga, and so on." This is because, as we all probably know, there were originally mean to be four routes, not three. He was forced to merge the Illya and Sakura route for reasons. He always meant for Saber, Rin, Sakura, and Illya to have the same about of significance in the complete Fate/stay night story, but out of no where he had to axe either Sakura or Illya. He clearly did not want to do that so he found a way to bypass it, make one the love interest and the other the heroine, something he never considered for the other routes because he did not need to merge anything back then. And why is Illya the heroine? If you read HF you should already know, or just use google-<br><br> A hero or heroine is a person or character who, in the face of danger and adversity or from a position of weakness, displays courage or self-sacrifice-that is, heroism-for some greater good. <br><br>I'm just trying to clear up a common misconception.
