I hate it.    <br>Steal those acrylic stands</br>      <br>Please don't let this be a GK.</br>  <br>because most ppl don't hate it</br>  <br> edition <br> wonfesT <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  Mako nendo when? It's not GSC store exclusive I hope.  All these great figures and new nendos, but no decent new animu related figmas. Come on wonfest, you're killing me here!  What's everyones preorders?  <br>go fuck yourself with this bullshit again</br>  <br>Same as last thread.</br>  <br>Wait for it to really start.</br>  In this time before wonfes, i'd like to make a question for all buyfags.<br><br>What is your dream figure that will NEVER get made? And i'm not talking "anything my waifu", i'm talking about a very specific figure based on a illustration or moment from a show that you are 100% sure will never be made, but you'd buy it instantly if it was. As an example, for me it would be a figure based on this illustration.</br></br>  <br>Go fuck yourself.</br>  Hopefully we'll get a painted huke Saber Alter.  <br>I'd be surprised if we didn't to be honest</br>  I Hope there's MonMusu stuff  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br> print this out on all the computers in a computer lab back in high school  <br> somehow don't get in trouble </br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>This.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br> get a boner watching rape and torture shit <br> this made me flaccid <br>thats so fucking disgusting pls kys</br></br></br>  <br>Help me in starting to dislike the mouth too, I don't want to splurge 200 bucks on her but I'm still fine with the crazy face.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128566046 <br> not wanting to watch tama's cute belly get drenched in cum <br>Fag.</br></br>  <br>The only explanation is that one of your school's higher-ups was into scat</br>  <br>Why does this even exist? It looks like shit and it's not relevant to Miku at all, I'm guessing it's based on some dumb illustration.<br><br>Why would you do that when there are tons of worthy Miku modules from the various Project Diva games?<br><br>Retards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your new is showing.</br>  <br>This is actually pretty creative bait, i commend you for the effort</br>  <br> it's not relevant to Miku at all <br><br>You're right.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't get it if you don't want to splurge.<br><br> shitposting this early </br></br></br>  <br>Miku is worst girl anyway. More Luka and Rin figures please.</br>  <br>Is this bait? It has to be, I refuse to believe that someone in here could be this retarded.</br>  <br>Newshit please go</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br>This brings back memories.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br>holy shit I forgot all about this<br><br>man the early 2000s internet was the best. what ever happened to that spirit of fun and laughing at other peoples misfortune?<br><br>I miss the prank pulling 4chan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, i want a Figma Black Hanekawa, in the cat PJ's. I REALLY want her in the bra and panties, but that seems too lewd for GSC, even though they've released lewd figma's before.</br></br>  <br> GK <br>Fuck I may as well.</br></br>  <br>That's the problem, I still want to and not even the mouth is making me want her less. The exclusive thing stings but on the other hand it means flat shipping, she's also not going to come out before April and I could safe up the money if I wanted to.<br>I'll have to wait for tomorrow for a few more pictures and if there are more potential pre-orders for next year that would fuck me over money wise.</br></br>  <br>What? I don't watch shit anime like Wixoss and it looks exactly like Miku.</br>  <br>Looks really good from behind but this face is a bit creepy. Hopefully he'll look better painted.</br>  <br>Then I would advice to just get it. Not all figs are perfect. May as well get it, especially if you're a wixoss fan. Unless they announce new figs its pretty much your only choice aside from nendroids and </br>  <br> shit anime like Wixoss <br>Don't be so salty Borutos only getting prize figs.</br></br>  Hey guys; just a quick question from a non-buyfag.<br>You guys do group orders for blind box type things? I really want to order picture related but I only want Kaede and not the others.<br>(source: amiami; around $30 for the set)</br></br>  <br>I'd treat them like TCG sets and just buy the bulk to guarantee kaede, unless otherwise stated or sold individually.</br>  <br>Check mfc.</br>  <br>check the myfigurecollection forum, they have a group buys section.<br><br>alternatively just sell the ones you don't want on ebay, it might take a while to get rid of them but you'll probably end up making a couple bucks in the end.</br></br></br>  Not really my thing but that's a good figure.  Nice.  <br>Is that some sort of harpie? Kinda sexy.</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, I've done that before but for a set that I could at least give some of the others away to good homes. I just legitimately only care for her in this set and don't know anyone else that would want the rest (other then /jp but I stray from that place). Maybe the eBay route is the way to go.<br><br>Thanks guys. Have a free Kaede.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sirene from Devilman, http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>235960</wbr></br>  <br>It's my kinda thing but that price tag.<br><br>I just want a harpy to hold me in her talons.</br></br></br>  <br>When and where?

Mostly looking out for http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287569, http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287874 and other monster girl figures (just don't really like Sirene enough to buy that)</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Its Alter, so whenever it will be it'll be late.</br></br>  <br>I like harpies but I prefer slime girls.</br>  <br>A dragongirl or loli lamia would be my favorite to get a figure of.</br>  <br> underwear <br><br>It's shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you like Slimes, congrads, there's at least 5 Melona figures and a revoltech.</br></br>  <br>A figure of a girl with huge tits with a gaping asshole with cum or other accessories that can be put inside it.<br><br>OR<br><br>A figure of a girl getting impaled on a dick so big that it deforms her belly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I already have Megahouse's Melona which is the only good looking one.</br>  <br>Please don't use a picture of Chris while shitposting.</br>  <br>These delicious slender bodies have been made for licking</br>  <br><br>The picture doesn't do it justice, but i have the pucchito and it's adorable. http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>35695</wbr></br></br>  <br>Sorry next time I'll use Kirika</br>  <br>Alternatively a PVC of one of the Milk Pot GKs.</br>  <br>same answer as last wonfes</br>  <br>That's better.</br>  canadafag wet dream  Enjoy the twenty-fifth of July.  <br>Goddamn those vagina bones look gross</br>    <br>Looks cute but I'm more into larger figures.</br>  Finally got this in the mail today. Hair and face could be better, but it's no big deal.  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>   was meant for     How long til wonfes guys?  <br> kalaid </br>  <br>5 minutes.</br>  <br> implying this is pornography </br>  <br>Wouldn't they need to ram a metal pole into Sayaka's butt for them to float like that?</br>  <br><br>The Skytube and Griffin are easily as good looking as the Megahouse IMHO. I'm afraid to buy the Skytube figure, i'd be platinum mad if it arrived broken.</br></br>  <br>10 hours or so</br>  <br>Almost fell for your bait. Good work anon.</br>  <br>her back would work too</br>  <br>Berserk nendos.</br>  <br>Scales of the final fight of Jojo part 3. Specifically the scene where Jotaro and Dio both go in to punch with their stands at the same time.</br>  Just putting this here. Hope they put out a prototype soon.   waifu collection projected to grow too big by the end of the year <br> buy another one of these just for figures <br><br>Am I the only one that stores waifus in closed cabinets and only bring them out when its time to flex my powerlevel?<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/Sterilite-014<wbr>28501-4-Shelf-Utility-Platinum/dp/B<wbr>000063SLI/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Something has always been really off about those to me.</br>  <br>I have them and only Dio has a weird sculpt and paintjob.</br>  <br>Might as well put them back in their boxes if you are hiding them in a closed cabinet</br>  <br>What does this say?</br>  <br>Do you have a room with no window? How do you protect them from sunlight?</br>  <br> waifus <br> plural </br></br>  <br>Also, weren't Dio and The World sold seperately? That's a pain in the ass, too.</br>  <br> not having multiple figures of your waifu </br>  what do you do with your lewd figures?  <br>Pretty sure I preordered them together as a set from BiJ.</br>  <br><br>Unfortunately and surprisingly, nothing. <br><br>Give me suggestions of how to pose my Queen's Blade Revoltechs guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That Tama face doesn't go with that lewd body</br>  <br>Pose them  on top of a hot plate. </br>  <br>I can always build the cabinet without the doors, or keep the doors open for display. Closed cabinets make it easy to keep my figures safe and relatively free from dust and sunlight while still being easily accessible when its time to  fap vigorously .</br>  <br>Get a detolf dumbass.</br>  <br>This figure. Except good and without the stupid actual-feather wings. It's a garage kit that only one was made of. Even the kit never got released as far as I know.</br>  <br><br>I live in a first world country, we don't own hot plates here</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for the Max Factory one.<br>The face of the FuRyu looks weird</br></br>  <br>Somewhat. My displays have curtains, but nothing is stopping people from moving those.</br>  <br>Easier to draw and people don't mind it.</br>  <br>figures won't fade with as long as their not directly positioned in sunlight, you fucking retard. and regular cabinets don't do anything against dust either, as it would need to airtight. but as someone that faps to figures and then hides them away in a closed cabinet, it's no surprise you're so stupid.</br>  <br>he's talking about multiple cabinets. unless it's saber or miku I find that quite unlikely.</br>  <br>Then put it on the induction plate you elitist cunt.</br>      <br> Get a detolf <br><br> Detolf <br> Width: 16 3/4 " <br> Depth: 14 3/8 " <br> Height: 64 1/8 " <br> Max load/shelf: 13 lb <br> $70 <br> have to drive to Ikea to pick up <br><br> Sterilite <br> Width: 25 5/8 " <br> Depth: 18 7/8 " <br> Height: 69 3/8 " <br> Max load/shelf: 40 lb <br> $77 <br> free Amazon shipping <br><br>Yeah, I'll take the one with more space/$.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because noses are ugly. and sometimes they have no nose at all in the frontal perspective. praise non-euclidean geometry.</br>    Don't forget to preorder the 2015 figure of the year™!  <br> cabinets don't do anything against dust either <br>That's patently bullshit.<br> how circulation work <br>There is hardly any in a cabinet so little dust is deposited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason for a detolf is that it's a display case. To display them from all sides. With that fancy "glass" stuff instead of dead tree dust.</br>    <br>Why is the word year trademarked?</br>  <br>Truly sufferring</br>    <br> those bellies <br>Jesus fuck</br></br>  <br>Vivid Red<br><br>At this point, there is no hope.</br></br></br>  <br> no miyu </br>  <br>I was it lucky to get it used, but in excellent condition for pretty cheap, so I can't complain. But yeah, the Max Factory one does have a better face and better hair, I'd say.</br>  ARIA finally get a new season, please give me a good quality fig of Akari WF!<br>Or better a good quality of her adult self, PLEASE!</br>  <br>Not him but I cut apart a large box, put foil on the side facing out and put it in the window directly across from my figures. It works well and keeps the heat out. The other window I just put a throw blanket over since it doesn't get direct sunlight and you can't see it from the outside.</br>  So what will you ask for uncle WonFes this year? <br>Personally I hope that figure of Millia from Guilty Gear Xrd by Wing shows up.</br>  <br><br><br>who is this fine and classy lady?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger detected</br></br>  <br>I second this.<br><br>I believe they made Vivid blue and Vivid yellow, so why they didn't made the best one ?</br></br></br>  <br> Akatsuki  <br>YESSS</br></br>  <br>They're just building suspense...</br>  <br>Where is she from? Stockings with those shorts + boots + comfy hoodie makes her adorable</br>  <br>She is from Tokyo Ravens.</br>  Any news or hope of the ooyodo nendo this wonder guys?  <br>I didn't see any teasers of her on the gsc twitter, but there was a taihou nendo teased</br>  <br>I hope it's her, all this lack of info is making me nervous she's not being made.</br>    <br>Hate to reply to a frogposter but I'd die for a good Judeau. Even the GK appears on YA approximately once every ten years.</br>  <br>I want the dragon form of nowi way more than a normal scale of her.</br>  <br>Any Momoiro.</br>  <br>Were you unable to read the English on the cover and google it yourself?<br><br>Are you even able to read my reply? Because it's also in English.</br></br></br>  <br> NEVER <br><br>So, any Square Enix properties that aren't Play Arts Kai shit?<br> Final Fantasy <br> Parasite Eve <br> Drakengard <br> pic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I got a spooky girl yesterday. I think she's my favorite Alter witch. I was silly for not pre-ordering her.  What's the word on this Mio?  <br>The English on the cover doesn't say the name of the LN, and your reply didn't say it either.<br>  東京レイブンズ </br></br>  <br>Can't say that makes me sad.<br>Their character designs are fairly bland most of the time.</br></br>  <br><br>The Volks witches are really good. I own all of them. If you're trying to decide between that or the Alter one pick the pose you like the most. They're both great.</br></br>  <br>They make scale figures as well as PAK but the quality is normally mediocre to really bad.</br>  Would anything happen to a figure if it was in a car for a few hours and it's like 80 degrees out? It's in a parking garage though so it's in the shade.  When the fuck does Wonfes begin?  <br>Tomorrow at 6pm.</br>  <br>In 30mins time.</br>  <br>It's 1am in Japan, Jesus anon let them sleep.</br>  I need this  <br>You missed it, it was yesterday.</br>  <br>We are two anon, I want her to join my Sol and my futur Ky</br>  <br>Her face feels off to me</br>  <br>A year from now</br>  <br>Depends on the type of figure anon</br>  <br>She physically suffers from her body.</br>  <br>I'm not a fan of titty monsters but she looks amazing.</br>  <br>She's not a whore though.</br>  <br>I agree with the other anon. I'm really happy with mine.</br>  <br>who knows?</br>  <br>I hate boatshit but I like this titty monster<br><br> Garage Kit <br><br>fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love her but it took me forever to get the strap on her shoulder</br>  <br>1/2</br>  <br>If they can work 16h a day I'm sure they can hurry up a bit, as well.</br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br><br>May the Lord have mercy upon your soul.</br></br>  <br><br>fuck off to mfc if you people want attention already</br></br>  <br><br> those potatoes <br><br> s2 never </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm glad I wasn't the only one. You really had to force it.</br></br>  <br>I mean proportion wise</br>  <br>Her massive tits are nice too.</br>  <br><br><br>there are so many awesome GK from abbyssal girls but they never pick them up, its as if they hated money</br></br></br>  <br>The name of the arc is clearly written in English.</br>  <br>But she could be easily bullied into the situation.</br>  would you an obaasan?  Anira will be expensive as hell  <br>I'll pay as long as she's under 26k</br>  <br><br>at least she'll be getting a mf scale soon.</br></br>  <br>you can't even fucking read katakana you blithering idiot<br>ヴ not ブ</br></br>  <br>Yeah she wasn't as bad as Lucchini but still so many of the witches have parts that are tough to put into place</br>  <br>I hope they dont actually go with that design, its the worst I've seen so far, not that its ugly, but lame as fuck</br>  <br> girls in armor  <br>That's my fetish</br></br>  <br>Any Vinland Saga, but especially the Thorkell vs. Thorfinn fight on the London Bridge.</br>  <br>Is the game really that popular? I tried it and it was pretty bland.<br>Or do people just like it for the art?</br></br>  <br>That is a lot of little toys.</br>  <br>It's one of the most popular mobage in Japan. Probably everyone have their reasons to play it</br>  <br>I like you.<br> also ridiculous tits </br></br>  <br>true and I need more scales of embarrassed girls</br>  <br> those thighs  <br> that armpit <br>Oh holy shit Tama</br></br></br>  <br> Lame as fuck <br> Giant girl with a fucking naval base around her <br> all the other Kancolle figs are the girl just standing there. That's it.  <br><br>You opinion is fucking shit and I don't even like Kancolle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Max Factory Figma.</br>  <br> 1/8 <br>Isn't she fucking gigantic 1/1?</br></br>  <br>Why does everyone ignore the completely fucked up leg?</br>  <br>Only if you have a micropenis. :^)</br>  <br><br>but the pose itself is lame, the props are okay, but they could do better, just look at this other pics  </br></br>  <br>So  FOR YOU </br>  <br>Because thighs and armpit</br>  <br>I'd long since dismissed her for her face since the prototype, but holy shit.</br>  <br>She will be fine</br>  <br>armpits are disgusting, why do people like them? is it just the fetish people?</br>  <br>Not even once.</br>  <br>I want her to join my Dizzy and hopefully a different Ramlethal than the super expensive current one.<br>I'd totes get a Jack-O one too for the ass. Can't ever have too much PVC ass.</br></br>  <br>why doesn't he wear his mask?</br>  Too soon for prototype right guys?  <br>Nah its a pretry common feature people like, just like boobs armpits give off pheromones</br>  Would you?  <br>No</br>  <br><br>Already did.</br></br>  <br>already did anon, it will keep me warm this winter</br>  <br>It's the body line and balance and how the body works and leads to other attractive parts, boos for example.</br>  <br>Too expensive, I could make one for half the price with a more accurate color</br>  <br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?</br>  <br><br>Go make your bootleg then.</br></br>  <br>It's actually quite complex.<br>Without his mask he's just Walter.<br>And Walter can compromise, unlike Rorschach.<br>It's the only instance he does so. That is: compromise.<br>Since in the whores son he sees hisself.<br><br>It's similar to the end when Dr. M instagibs him.<br>Rorschach doesn't die (or compromise, even in the face of Armageddon [sic]).<br>But Walter does.<br>He sees the purpose and need in Rorschachs demise, but Rorschach hisself cannot allow hisself to be killed.<br><br>Sorry for the /co/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I might make one someday.</br>  There will be more Pochacos announced at wonfes right?   mfw XXXL sized umaru cape is not available for sale so /a/ makes their own   <br><br><br>How are you suppose to go out in public with that?

Do you think doujins are bootlegs as well?</br></br></br>  <br>Armpits are one of my favorite parts of the female anatomy. That being the case, I can't wait for Max Factory's Rin scale.</br>    <br>That's a waste of an opportunity.

Without him az would turn into shit</br>  <br>Hard to ruin what's already shit.</br>  <br>That's not Asshime.</br>  <br>YER KIDDEN</br>  Only delusional Yuckynofags will disagree. Season 2 was shit thanks to her.      <br>OP said one character</br>  Biggest piece of shit MC of the decade  <br>The poster child of ruining everything. Fucking stupid character.</br>  Miku in DAL  Her name should have been "Edgy."  <br> irrational badly written plot device for drama drama  <br> good <br>If anything the show should have written out that cuck and ended it all in episode 12</br></br></br>  USED HER DEAD BROTHER TO WIN THE HAREM.  a shit, A SHIIIIIIIIIT  <br>Careful, you'll trigger the fatefags.</br>  <br>Fucking annoying bitch.</br>  <br>She's shit, yes. But it was Slaine who "singlehandedly ruined the anime".<br><br>Shithime was asleep half the time, the other half she was with Inaho.</br></br></br>  <br>worse than hitler</br>  <br>It was already shit. I appreciated and fantasized about her putting her legs on my dick, same with the girl that was close to the MCs.<br><br>Didn't mind the character at all.<br><br><br>Why did you post Slain instead of Inaho?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The lesbian from Ben-to<br><br>and those 2 sisters were pretty annoying too i guess</br></br>  <br>Inaho saved the world and was completely inoffensive<br>Slaine was a retard for no reason 90% of the time and ruined many people's lives, even down to a poor crippled girl</br></br>  <br>Inaho was a completely unrealistic and annoying as fuck gary stu, pretty much the worst thing that can be included in a modern anime.<br><br>Don't know all that shit about Slaine cause I dropped it after the first season ended and Inaho survived getting shot in the eye point blank.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean saved. Inami ruined the show and luckily Yamada carried it on her back.</br>    This fucking piece of shit  <br>The show would literally not exist without her. <br><br>Kuroneko on the other hand straight up ruined S2.</br></br></br>  This faggot could have used a major personality overhaul.  Waste of screentime  <br>Why all the hate on Near? He just showed up and did what he was supposed to do. It's not his fault Light became a deranged idiot, got sloppy, and fell into his lap. Near was a pretty great guy all things considered, he was super smart and succeeded where L and everyone else failed.</br>  <br>Spot on.<br>Kirino a shit.</br></br>  <br>Bet you've never read the VN, have you?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H2q<wbr>NFdjE_AM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>You beat me to it.<br>Given that the series is pretentious as fuck, that obnoxious fucker ruined the entire VN for me. I tried to watch the adaptation but I couldn't take him for more than 10 episodes.</br></br>  <br>Everyone in AZ was unrealistic. In terms of ruining absolutely everything, Slaine takes the cake by being a plot device made for making bad decisions. Good on you for ignoring S2.</br>    <br>Here we go again.</br>  <br>honestly, I can see why people would hate Shirou. You kind of have to like simple people with simple goals to like him,  at least until Heaven's Feel </br>  <br>Fuck you faggot</br>    <br> MUH PRECIOUS SACRED PORN NOVEL <br><br>back to &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/ with you cancer</br></br></br>  The epitome of worst girl and show ruiner.<br><br>Claire a SHIT.</br></br>  <br> You kind of have to like simple people with simple goals <br>I like simple people with simple goals. Its just that Shirou over exaggerates that simple goal as the most important thing in the universe that makes it extremely fucking annoying. Literally one of the most pretentious characters I have ever experienced.</br></br>  This cumguzzler  <br>So you a Light worshipper?</br>  <br>Himeji please</br>  <br>Ruined a franchise</br>  <br><br>How can best girl ruin a show?</br></br>  <br> being retarded </br>  <br>You forgot we aren't on tumblr fujo.</br>  <br>How can su be so much of a faggot?</br>  <br>That's not Shinji.</br>    <br>This. What a stupid drama queen and hateable bitch. Her arc was the most retarded shit in the show.</br>    <br>ohhh boy, not this shit again, the VN is just hentai nothing more<br><br>Why do you give so much importance to a badly drawn hentai?</br></br></br>  <br>yes THIS is what ruined Soul Eater. Everything else about it was completely fine.</br>  <br>Fuck you nigger.</br>  <br><br><br>Bingo.</br></br></br>    <br>Edgy Two Hand sounds like a really lewd game.</br>    <br>You delusional fuck</br>  <br>He's more of a weapon/plot device than a character. Prove me wrong.</br>  Look, I'm sorry, but you don't introduce a character, try to make him significant to the plot and to the emotional well being of our protagonist, and kill him off all in the same motherfucking episode, and expect me to give a shit, or for that matter be anything but incredulous when Shinji gives a shit. That's not how character development fucking works  <br>I'll fucking cut you.</br>  <br>You know this to be true.</br>  <br> Yer kiddin' </br>    Can't even watch the 2nd season because this annoying bitch is in it.  discuss.

Who is winning the Hatyatebowl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>We all know who wins.</br>  <br>Here's your counterpoint</br>  <br>Five hundred and one chapters and you still haven't learned that Hayate accidentally spills those sorts of lines without thinking constantly.<br>I'm impressed.</br></br>  <br> Hata going full CTMEOY. <br>Is Ruka coming back? Please Hata!<br><br><br>Holy shit, Yukiji completely OWNED Hina.<br><br>BASED.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   501 chapters <br>What the fuck<br><br>I dropped this after the Greece arc since the quality took a huge dive, what the fuck happened since then?</br></br></br>  <br>He said the exact same line to Ruka.<br>We all know how it ended.</br></br>    <br>Good old S1.<br>Best season.</br></br>  <br>Idolshit that noone liked outside of Japan. it's gotten back on track lately with the current arc being entertaining.</br>  <br>I expected LOLHINAWINS on this.<br>Glad I was wrong.<br>Yukiji's keikaku is completely based.</br></br></br>  <br>Kuro Tsubaki soon.<br><br>maybe we'll also see Himegami?</br></br></br>   Hayate no Gotoku is still ongoing <br> 500+ chapters <br>Jesus fuck, has this become a generic battle shounen like Negima?</br></br>  <br>If Ruka appears /a/ explodes.<br>The only way I can see Hina winning this is if Hata wants to make her this series' Ayase (aka gets to confess and gets BTFO because Nagi/Athena)</br></br>  <br><br><br>Hata will never let go of this money train.</br></br></br>  <br>no, a generic comedy manga</br>  <br>It's something like Gintama but based on a high school...</br>  <br>Was she always this stacked?</br>    A-tan reappearing when?  <br>I want to see some more Ruka, she stir up the other girls like no one. Also her and Hayate interactions were great.</br>  <br>If Athena appeared and claimed her husband, it would be a tsunami.</br>  <br>When did she get so stacked?</br>  <br>True, he does have a habit of blurting out his opinions of the girls that surround him.<br><br>He did, but Hayate's actually mentioned how much he admires Hinagiku a number of times over the manga, both casually and seriously. Also Ruka was introduced incredibly far into to the manga. She was written off as a non winner by the community right from the beginning of her crush. Everyone else has had a great deal of time and effort putting in their character development, having the new girl pop out of nowhere and sweep him up would have caused torches and pitchforks. Everyone would basically agree that anyone would be better than Ruka just so can avoid feeling like our time and investment were cheated. Very similar to how Nisekoi has the sensei/childhood friend come in late and was eliminated before she got any development. Meanwhile Hina has been part of the cast from early on and has been incredibly helpful in every arc since her introduction.<br><br>Also just a litter fun wordplay when I saw this image. Hayate says queen and in his mind he thinks Athena. But Hina's practically a princess type given her general personality, her work ethic, the respect she is given, and even her name. What happens princesses when they marry? (Assuming they or they hubby has succession)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here you go, ho ho ho!</br>    <br>Wasn't Las Vegas the setting of a previous arc? I skipped a huge chunk of Hayate chapters and I should probably go back and read them.</br>  I haven't read Hayate in years. But is there any chance of these two hooking up when they inevitably lose?  So many good tsundere in this series.  <br> Ruka was introduced far into the manga. <br>She was introduced right after Athena's arc.<br> Hina has been part of the cast from early on and has been incredibly helpful in every arc since her introduction. <br>Izumi, Athena and Nagi are way more important for Hayate's life than Hinagiku.<br>Hinagiku can be a good partner, but that means nothing. Now that you compare Hayate with Nisekoi, Hinagiku would be Hayate's Tsugumi.<br>Also, remember, the series is called Hayate the combat BUTLER. I don't want cries when Nagi wins like it happened with Oreimo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i think that was Athens.<br><br>well, Nagi would probably bought all the Greek islands because why not.</br></br></br>    <br>I think you're forgetting something very important.</br>  Is Wataru x Sakuya really a thing? Or is it just my shipper delusion years ago?  <br>Wataru wanted Isumi IIRC.</br>  <br>Wasn't there an arc that had Wataru's mom show up?</br>  <br>Chirstmas only in 6 months time, anon.<br><br>a very long 6 months time....</br></br></br>  <br>so, the manga gets shittier and they upgrade hamster?</br>  <br><br><br>Wataru gave up on Isumi after she became comic relief/deus ex machina and is going to marry Saki, a girl twice his age.</br></br></br>   501 <br>Wow. I stopped reading this in the doujinshi arc. Did something good happen after that?</br>  <br>Hayate and Maria going on a date.<br><br>Nagi's little sister showed up.<br><br>Fanservice. Lots of fanservice and Hayate moments with other girls like Chiharu.<br><br>Izumi getting bullied.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Nagi getting back to the mansion.<br>I will never forget that emotional moment with Nagi remembering all the adventures in the apartment with the other girls.</br></br>  <br>I thought this shit ended years ago.</br>  Izumi best girl.  <br>I'm not forgetting Maria. The manga forgot about her. Soon she'll be working part time with Klaus if things keep progressing this way. Unless she gets some new developments all she has going for her story wise is that she's an orphan with no knowledge of her heritage.<br><br>Yes. Ruka was introduced right after the most important arc to date. That's like saying you got the main act and the warm up act mixed up. A full 5 years after after the show started.<br><br>I'll give you Athena because she helped him out when he was a midgit and for being the Antagonist durng her namesake's arc. And Nagi helping pay off his debts. But Izumi? She has almost no impact on anything other than the accidental fanservice and the little bit about the marriage promise that neither remember.<br><br>At very minimum Hina and Hayate have saved each other's lives several times. Helped him with school work. And is now trying to help him pay off his debt.<br><br> remember, tha the series is called Hayate the combat BUTLER <br>Fine I'll take it. remember the series is called "Hayate the COMBAT Butler". Combat wise the series has shown Hayate, his brother, Athena, Hinagiku, and to a lesser extent her sister to be any good at actual combat. Everyone else would be the equivalent of named NPC. And remember Dragonball? Goku, the strongest man on Earth ended up marrying Chi-chi, the strongest woman on Earth (the same thing sort of happened with Gohan and Videl, but 18 was the strongest woman). I don't want cries when Hayate ends up partnering with someone who can actually fight.<br><br> :P </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nice tan.  <br>Yes, pretty much. It's not very noticeable in earlier seasons because she always had that thick school uniform coat on.</br>  <br>I don't think that's exactly decided yet. Wataru still has shiptease with both Sakuya and Saki, only Isumi is out of the bowl.</br>  A-tan best girl.<br>Hayate agrees too.</br>   Chiharu secret best girl   <br>Izumi kept Hayate's soul alive when he thought he'd lost Athena.</br>  <br>Except that Wataru promised Saki that he'd make a lot of money so she wouldn't have to work as his maid anymore, while blushing like a tomato. Sakuya is only still teased with him because she helps him out with money problems.<br><br> I really miss Hayate being her onii-chan. </br></br></br>  <br> I want her to pretend to seduce Hayate just to get Hina to take the initiative, then realize she's fallen for her fake love. </br>  <br>No.<br><br>Watch Season 1 Ep 37 at ~17:00 mins, she's been enhanced. I was going to post a screen, but I realized the DL on my laptop is fuckin' censored. I even checked against the free crunchyroll stream and there's a shitload more steam on mine.</br></br></br>  Since when did Hamster have those tits?  <br> anime <br>You need to go by the manga m9.</br></br>  <br> Now that you compare Hayate with Nisekoi, Hinagiku would be Hayate's Tsugumi. <br>Are you on drugs?</br></br>  <br>If anything, Nagi would be Hayate's Chitoge because his original hiring was based on a romantic misunderstanding, though personality-wise she's more like Haru. Hamster would be Onodera, both because she was his classmate first and has had a crush on him for a long time. Hinagiku is more like Chitoge in personality, except she's known her feelings for him for a long time and hasn't tried to deny it. <br><br>Maria or Kotona (the girl who kissed him after the quest to get the King's Jewel) would be his Tsugumi.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually liked the few chapters in between the current arc and the idolshit better than the current arc. They are the high point of the post-Athena arc part of the series for me.<br><br>Those are the kind of chapters that truly make Hayate in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember being told to just watch the anime to some point if I ever do. Season 3 or something and just pretending it ends there.</br>  <br>  Hayate says queen and in his mind he thinks Athena <br>Maria's a queen too.</br></br>  <br>It's no use trying to make parallels with Nisekoi because, unlike Komi, Hata is not a complete hack.<br><br>Saying that Hinagiku is in any way like Tsugumi was just specially dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, she is manly.</br>  <br>That's not SKET Dance</br>  <br>In a completely different way than Hinagiku.</br>  <br> I want her to try it as Haru, before getting found out </br>  <br>Well you did say seasons.</br>  <br>I still remember Tanaka Rie's ara ara</br>  <br>I'm not the original anon you were replying to, though.</br>   a Hayate thread that's 90+ post <br><br>My word.</br></br>  This show seems cool but I heard it goes to shit later.  <br>In that case I did read at least up to volume 10 but I started engineering classes and I lost interest. <br><br>After so long the only thing that would make me pick it back up is Hammy. Does she get decent page time?</br></br></br>  <br>The first two seasons are worth it. <br><br>S1 specially is amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>Stick to S1 and you won't be disappointed, also all the torrents I've found are visually censored. Bizarrely enough though the CR streams are the only ones lacking visual censorship.</br>  <br>censored?</br>  <br>Just get SS-Eclipse release</br>  <br>More like Hamster is healthy Marika, she got rejected once and still not giving up<br><br> Nagi = Chitoge <br>Based on her development(more like none) I can hardly approve it, even Hayate himself(so far I suppose)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait sorry not hamster, I mean Ayumu</br>  <br>Ep 37 is the prime example.<br><br>Top is Torrent bottom is shit CR stream, laziest edit I've ever done but it illustrates my point.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll check out the first season.</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=1<wbr>93924<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=1<wbr>93929</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>I'm surprised too. I thought it'd die before I caught up, since I was like 10 chapters behind, but to my surprise it survived for hours.<br><br>Guess I underestimated the power of the hamster.<br><br><br>Huh, I actually started Hayate on the same month I started Engineering classes, funny coincidence.<br><br>And I'd say no, she doesn't really get a lot of focus, but her (and Izumi's) chapters are always top tier, so I'd recommend reading it anyways. Hayate is easier to marathon than read weekly anyways.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have it and the other popular one. Eclipse has an "audio de-censor" that removes some bleeps but that's it. I must have watched it on CR at some point to know it was visually uncensored</br>  <br> wait sorry not hamster, I mean hamster <br>Also, stop comparing this to Nisekoi pls.</br></br>  <br>Ayumu is hamster, it's Nagi's nickname for her.</br>    I want to fuck a Nagi  <br><br>Oops I am so panic that I thought hamster = Izumi<br><br> Also, stop comparing this to Nisekoi pls <br>Just adding a note I found accurate, sorry about that<br><br>Wonder who will win in this arc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Izumi does need a nickname, in my opinion.</br>  <br> 19 gb with no seeds <br>Th-thanks.</br></br>  <br> Cute airhead with dumb luck <br>How to conclude that</br></br>  <br>Season 1 has seeds and I'm downloading right now, what are you talking about?</br>  <br> Combat wise the series has shown Hayate, his brother, Athena, Hinagiku, and to a lesser extent her sister to be any good at actual combat. <br>Isumi is also skilled at combat, semi-prominently. Then you have characters nobody remembers like Himuro, Kanade, Makina (he's a goddamned Jormungandr), and the recently-relevant Sonia. Himegami is implied to be skilled as well, but has currently only appeared in the first anime.</br></br>  Isumi and Izumi are best girl<br><br>Izumi a bit better though</br></br>  <br> Slut </br>  <br> slut <br> still devoted to Hayata-kun ever since her childhood </br></br>   33 posters <br> thread that doesn't immediately fall off the board <br>Hayate is saved. The curse of Doujinamek is over. Now we just need Hina to win and buy Hayate off of Nagi.</br></br>  Is it finally Hina's year?  <br>2016 will be her year!</br>  <br>m. bison is that you?</br>  <br>How long has it been? Fuck I missed you guys.<br><br> Old hags a best. </br></br></br>  <br> tfw your Hina images are so old that you can't even find all of them in your image macro folder anymore </br>  <br>No, it's only just beginning. We're stuck in America now.</br>  So why exactly does the manga go to shit?  <br>not enough combat butler things</br>  <br>Is it because of hamster?</br>  <br>It doesn't. It's simply a matter of whether or not you like this sort of thing. I, for one, am perfectly happy with there being buttloads of pointless gag chapters in between serious plot points. Thanks to that I feel that HnG characters are among the most fleshed-out of manga I read.<br><br>I admit it does get kind of annoying when it takes so long to get to plot that characters are forgotten (Wataru's mother still has a Hougyoku iirc, and what the fuck happened to Housen motherfucking Yozora?).</br></br></br>  <br> Implying hamster is actually popular <br>I am happy with that<br>The author should take at look at this</br></br></br>  Holy shit a Hayate thread. And I should update this   <br> Sharuna and Fumi <br>Kek. You know, I'm not a big fan of theirs, but I have to admit it feels a little lonely with them not having a skit this arc.</br></br>  <br>I loved the reference to Banjou and his role in HNK as Souther.<br><br>Hamster is love, Hamster is life.</br></br></br>  <br> Kana Asumi and Saori Gotou have been a part of Hayate since 2008 and have had less than 5 minutes of screen time across 4 seasons and a movie </br>  <br> That aquarion reference. <br>Really.</br></br>  Is thread dead?  <br>It's late at night.</br>  Why was Athens arc not animated? I need my drug  I hate to bring this up, but did Hata write off Maria's entire backstory when she mentioned being brought to Mykonos to translate the legendary inscription? <br><br>Or do you think he's still planning to do a Masterpiece Theater-style story arc for her?</br></br>  <br> Manglobe <br> Having complete S2 and a bunch of OVAs that sold poorly <br> Wanting them to animate A-Tan's arc <br>These are the geniuses behind SamFlam and Gangsta. If they had animated it, nobody would've seen it and it wouldn't be possible to get a better studio to animate it.<br><br> Chapter 500 <br> You Can Make Another Anime If You Want <br>Hata has no control over this does he.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Girl on the left even looks kinda like the chick from it, hairstyle wise anyway.</br>  <br>Back up plan for when the manga is indeed no longer as profitable.</br>  <br>Even more, Isumi is the strongest character of the series.</br>  <br>So what are you saying is Hayate ends with either Isumi or Athena, and Hina maybe gets Himegami?</br>  <br>Hata is just in it for the money.</br>  <br>the same thing as why there is no TWGOK VN to appease the souls of those who were crushed.</br>  Sakuya back when?  <br>She's on par with A-tan</br>  <br>Is maria still relevant?</br>  <br>True.<br>But the truth is, Hinagiku is NOT the strongest character of the series.<br><br>BTW: I think final contest will be a karaoke contest with Ruka as judge. <br>And now we should put our dream covers if this results to be the contest.</br></br></br></br></br>  I used to watch this a long time ago. Is it worth picking up the manga?  <br>There was something like that. Girls ended up in bunny girls suits.</br>  <br>It's fun, yeah. Don't expect some complex story or character development tho. Also don't speedread it or you'll get bored.<br><br>If it's still your thing then pick it up</br></br></br>  <br>TWGOK had, what, 28 potential romantic interests if you add in the demon girls? <br><br>They should've made the TWGOK VN something similar to Pokemon or Norn's split games, with the girls split up over something like 6 games.</br></br></br>  <br>Maria who?<br><br>  R.I.P Maria ;_;  </br></br></br>  <br>Me too</br>  <br>She's Hayate's flirting date and she knows ancient languages that're sure to show up as the race for the stones heats up.</br>  The most successful Hayate thread in years.<br>I can say without mistake: This is Ayumu's year.</br>  <br> Hamster's year <br> Not Hina's year <br>In all honesty, it's Hayate's year.</br></br></br>  <br>Already dismissing her 2015 victory?<br>She is eligible for 2015 right?</br></br>  <br> not A-tan <br><br>what is wrong with you</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>What a powerful and magnificent beast!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do people still care? She won an ISML already, that's quite a feat. I always give her my votes (sans one matchup), but I'm totally satisfied that she's been crowned once already.</br>  <br> ISML </br>  <br> ISML <br> 2009, aka "her year", when JC Staff did everything to make her the most popular character of the series. </br></br>  hamster is for sexualizing    Shit, a Hayate thread with over a hundred replies? I'm surprised there's so many people still reading this.<br><br>Anyways, I'm really enjoying the current arc. The comedy has stepped up a bit, and it feels like we're getting some actual plot progression.<br><br>It's kind of suspicious that the prize money is exactly the same amount as his debt. Do you guys think Hayate will win and be able to pay off all of his debt? Knowing Hata, he'll have some shitty twist where Hayate wins the money but loses it all to interest on that black credit card he used a few chapters back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The obvious result would be Nagi's win, by Hayate surrendering at the end.<br>And each time this arc looks more like CTMEOY, my theory grows stronger.<br>Check the CTMEOY episodes in Las Vegas for further proof.</br></br></br>  <br>He hasn't used that card yet right?<br><br>Also what's up with Izumi/Isumi? Couldn't Hata come up with better names?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not as much of an issue in Japanese since they're names are written 泉 and 伊澄.</br>  <br> She is eligible for 2015 right? <br>There was some Hayate animation this year?<br><br>Does Saimoe even still exist?</br></br></br></br>   this thread is still alive <br>Well, fug.<br><br>I'm never underestimating the power of hamster's hamsters again.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember what the cut off line is but the last ova was in december.<br><br>And yes, Sakimoe still exists.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it had died last year.<br><br>Cut off is either 31 June or July, if I'm not mistaken, but I didn't know an OVA had come out. Was it manga adaptation or original content?</br></br></br>  <br>the power of hamster and die hard</br>  <br>There were three OVAs, the first in June, the second in September and the third in December.</br>  What kind of girls have playing cards like these?  <br>S ophisticated individuals. </br>  If we post enough of Asuka-chan moot will come back to us.  <br>I want to press my face between those buns.</br>    <br>Same.</br>   this will never be me     We wait for Volume 5 chapter 3 later today.<br><br>Also, here's the previews for Episode 4.
