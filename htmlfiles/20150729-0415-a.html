[ Give me 3 reasons why Akane isn't best girl.  1) Ukyou<br>2) Ranma-chan<br>3) Kodachi</br></br>  <br>Ranma is best girl.<br>Ukyou is best boy.<br>Fuck this story for not going best route.</br></br></br>  <br>onnateki Ranma<br>Yoiko<br>Pigtailed girl</br></br></br>  <br>There was only one best route, and what you named wasn't it.</br>  Doesn't get along well with Ranma, so their interactions are just the stock "I hate you but secretly I love you" with no decent progress over the manga's long lifespan.<br>Not a good fighter compared to others.<br>Can't accept criticism well, like how she's always pushing her terrible cooking, meaning she won't change at all.</br></br>  <br>Ranma x Ryoga is best, everyone agreees</br>  Her personallity is literally worse than shit.   shitty cook <br> short hair <br> worst figure </br></br>  1. Shampoo <br>2. Ukyo<br>3. The fact that she can be a royal pain in the ass.</br></br>  <br>1) Unreliable tsundere that prefer the "punch first, ask question later" approach even if she's the weakest of the cast<br><br>2) Her sisters are way hotter and better in their own fields<br><br>3) When your so-called fiancee is (litteraly) a better woman than you, you know you suck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay. <br><br>1. built like a stick<br>2. dumb as a brick<br>3. talks like a hick</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked her better in Inuyasha</br>  <br><br>I thought the final arc actually did cut to the heart of Ranma's feelings and also did a good job at showing how the characters had leveled up in their skills. I think the series would have ended better if the manga had them get married instead of LOL so random, wedding ruined.</br></br>  <br><br>So right.</br></br>  <br> I thought the final arc actually did cut to the heart of Ranma's feelings <br>The final arc of a series that ran for almost 10 years and 38 volumes. Too little, too late.</br></br>  <br>The fishing rod of love chapter was great</br>  <br><br>Yeah, but it's not like Takahashi was writing berserk or something. Ranma 1/2 was build around a status quo that was interrupted for comedic effect. In the intervening the characters grew stronger and more unique skills, which was good for a payoff when the time came but the majority of the series isn't about building the arc it was about situational comedy.</br></br>  <br> In the intervening the characters grew stronger and more unique skills <br>What did Akane, the heroine and main love interest, get?</br></br>  <br>Even Kodachi is better than Akane</br>  <br>she got more useless</br>  <br><br>Sad and true. She never had to fight anyone and really her whole kempo schtick died off along with Dr. Tofu so there really was no purpose in making her a martial artist. Actually, since some arcs depend on her getting kidnapped it would be counter productive.</br></br>  <br>Plus, with Shampoo, she can be really cute.</br>  <br>there was an even better route than that it's ranma x  ranma </br>  <br><br>She's insultingly dense.</br></br>  <br>You are aware she's more intelligent than she acts sometimes, right? If you want to talk insultingly dense, Azusa Shiratori.</br>  <br>!!!! Ranma no BAKAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>I think she acts like a dumb ditz around Ranma cause she wants to be all perfect wife and stuff, when combat happens she suddenly gets serious</br>  <br>Because nips actually preferred a chinese amazon over her.</br>    <br>damnit why does the best girl have to be a boy?</br>  <br>Hard to argue against that.</br>  <br>Sssssh, it's a girl right now</br>   disregard any concept of law and social moral <br> manipulative and easily gain people trust <br> no real empathy, mostly mimic to appear normal to others <br> display violent behavior with no emotion <br> dissociate emotionally from their action regardless how terrible they are <br><br>He has every factor of a psychopath. In fact hes a nature psychopath. Prove me wrong<br><br> Pro tip you cant </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>-3/10</br>  <br>a true sociopath right here</br>  <br>He helps people as a Hunter to protect them.</br>  <br>He just wanted to find his dad, just because he doesn't kill many people along the way doesn't mean he is very interested in protecting anyone other than his close friends.</br>  <br> animeonlyfags everyone <br><br>Here's a thought actually read the manga for once.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah Gon is incredibly simple, he simply couldn't process how to deal with Pitou. His transformation into Gon-san wasn't only him literally 'growing up', but having to deal with an adult situation with the morality of a child. He mentally broke under the weight of the dilemma.</br>  <br>He's naturally empathetic though, there's literally no reason to think he's mimicking it to seem normal. He's a decent kid, just doesn't have strong ethical principles unless he's personally invested in the situation. He's also extremely emotional during the entirety of his breakdown.</br>  <br>He's cute</br>  He ain' right in da head.  <br>But I want to fuck him, and that's what really matters.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128686179 <br>why the fuck would you make a husbando out of an armadillo</br>  <br>OP, I've thought it like that before.<br><br>But now, I'm more inclined to believe Gon is simply a mature person stuck in a kid's body. So the way he acts seems bit faked.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128686179 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128686290 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128688572 <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128688670 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128688778 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128688802 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128688909 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this? An image for ants?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128689019 <br>Uh no shit, seems some people are having trouble with reading comprehension today</br>  <br>I wanted Pouf to be able to see it. Anything for best guard and best ant.</br>  <br><br> &gt;no real empathy, mostly mimic to appear normal to others <br> &gt;display violent behavior with no emotion <br> &gt;dissociate emotionally from their action regardless how terrible they are <br><br>This where you fuck up, the problem is that you're not taking the two former points you make into consideration when judging the later three. You see Gon do something something in an unfimilliar way and assume the worse, even though it's clearly obviouse he is caplable of a strong sense of morals, empathy, and standards.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best guard didn't deserve such a tragic end.</br>  <br>Reminder to report everything this anon quoted, gender shitposting should not be tolerated</br>  <br>All qt boys get tragic ends.</br>  <br>But it's not right</br>  Gon is a fucking angel you retard    gon a slut  <br>He's a sweet boy</br>  <br>But he's only promiscuous towards one boy.</br>  <br>He only cares about people closest to him. Everyone else can get fucked.</br>  <br> bait bait <br>ebin</br></br>  <br>well he was pretty bad at his job, he could've handled it much better but too bad he was a literal maniac. Not much sympathy for him.</br>  <br> ebin <br>Thanks, now kindly fuck off to your containment board.<br/></br></br>  <br> Everyone else can get fucked. <br>He wasn't that close to Zushi and got back at one of the faggots who fucked with him. Also he reached out to Canary and helped out some randoms like the guy on the boat, the guy in the forest, and the guy on the world tree.</br></br>  <br> He wasn't that close to Zushi and got back at one of the faggots who fucked with him <br>Gon's the kind of person that gets easily attached to people he thinks seem nice. Though I agree with everything else.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128688987 <br> Pitou was once a loyal human <br> my heart </br></br>  It's me questioning the laws of nen again<br><br>Is it possible for Knov to transport APR to the room?</br></br>  <br>i've no interest in your home board, sorry anon-kun</br>  <br>Being hanta is suffering.</br>  <br>Shoot with white hair down is literally kite</br>  <br>I doubt Pitou (and Pouf) were based off individuals.

Do you take minor requests?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing that they most have in common is that they're moe bros.</br>  <br>what?<br>I'm saying their consciousnesses likely don't take root in one individual like the solider ants tended to, rather they're too mixed to the point where they can only be their own person. Though they probably been able to express some knowledge from past lives, such as Pitou turning into a neurosurgeon twenty seconds after being born or Pouf playing that violin all the time.</br></br>  <br>Depends on what it is.</br>  <br>Togashi's going for a reverse Kuwabara. He is going to make Leorio the protagonist during the final arc.</br>  <br>I was joking, I actually agree with you. That's just the first thing that I thought of, when you said conglomerate of individuals.</br>  <br>Feitan with a little pet mouse? Or Shalnark doing anything.</br>  <br>Sure, why not?</br>  <br>To be fair, the only person in the main cast who is sane is Leorio.

This is truly torture.</br></br>  <br>Nah, it seems at least the soul were from individuals since most of the ants had single human memories of when they were alive.</br>  <br>Best bros for life.</br>  <br><br>The main problem with this threads is that people try to judge HxH based on our society's ethics when their world is completely different and brutal as fuck.<br><br>Gon is like a wild animal, he's caring and gentle to people he likes, and ruthless to whoever he doesn't, it's not hard to understand.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128692201 <br>Laughed way too hard at this. Thank you for improving my art!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128692201   Reminder than Pitou was a filthy monstrosity that got what it deserved.  <br>Thank you, Feitanfriend!</br>  <br>Gon really likes you to be evil, because he can just eradicate you without second thoughts</br>  <br>No problem, mate.</br>  <br>This is just headcanon. Stop.</br>  <br> psychopath <br>This is already a tumblr buzzword so good luck next time.</br></br>  <br>cats are clean.</br>  <br> Kanzai <br> clean </br></br>  <br>he's just a retarded furfag</br>  <br> traumatized kid <br> psycopath <br>He does have a weird moral compass though.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but he's right. He doesn't really care much about anyone other than his close friends, he's actually kind of an hypocrite when it comes to this.<br>Look at when he wanted to take Hisoka's badge, he was okay with using someone's death at his advantage but only if it wasn't one of his friends.</br></br>  <br>I don't see how he's a hypocrite. He never claimed to care about everyone.</br>  <br>Go read the manga, nobody in HxH gives a shit about strangers, and for good reason. If you want to give Gon shit for not caring about total strangers then you'd have to say the same thing about Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika.<br><br> also giving a shit about a bunch of kidnappers who were going to hurt your friend, simply to win a match. </br></br></br>  <br>I know, that's why i said "kind of". I still think he's a nice kid, just that he was put in a bunch of really shitty situations.</br>  There isn't a HxH general anymore so I'll ask here...<br><br>Can anyone post the Hisoka's version of pic related? I can't find it anywhere...</br></br>  <br>I got you anon</br>    <br> There isn't a HxH general anymore <br>What?</br></br>    <br><br>Psychopaths are at best, indifferent to their relatives and loved ones.<br><br>Gon has shown to care deeply for his friends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is a miracle of the universe. He just needs therapy.</br>  <br> headcanon <br>Isn't that literally what he said to Meleoron?</br></br>  <br>Basically, but it's off base to say Gon wants people to be evil so he can beat them. It's just easier on him if someone they are.</br>  <br> defeat <br>What was the word use in moonspeak? I keep seeing different translations for this scene.</br></br>  <br>My nip is shit so I can't say anything about the implications but I can at least look up the word 倒す<br> 1. to throw down; to bring down; to blow down; to fell; to knock down; to set (something) down on its side; to turn (something) on its side <br> 2. to kill; to defeat; to beat </br></br></br>  Pitou a best girl. No other Hunter x Hunter girl will ever come close.  <br>There are so many things wrong with this post that I don't even know where to start.</br>  <br>Thanks anon, i get the idea. I guess "to kill" would have been a bit too extreme.<br>And you're right, i don't think Gon cares much about someone being evil, like Zepile pointed out. I think he just really has a simple thought process regarding potential enemies, which is part of the reason he couldn't handle the whole Pitou situation.<br>Funnily enough, Meleoron and Zepile both say something similar about "not seeing an end to his limit", i'm not too sure what they meant by that though.</br></br></br>  Did the show go through any sort of timeslot changes or anything? I've always been interested as to why they kept things light during parts like the exam arc (e.g not showing Hisoka's cards piercing the fake examiner's face, not showing blood when Hisoka wrecked those guys in the mist), but later on when the tone of the story became darker they were able to go all out with it.  <br> girl </br>  <br>Yes, the time slot changed when CA started. Dunno why they didn't have that time slot to begin with.</br>  <br>Those lines were mostly foreshadowing for Gon-san, I assume.</br>  <br>Yeah, i think they did change timeslots during the Yorkshin and Chimera ants arcs. It really becomes obvious when you compare Hisoka's arms getting cut off with sparkles in the Arena and Uvo's scenes.<br>They only changed the CA slot around episode 90 something though, some of the most disturbing scenes were on the morning timeslot.</br></br>  Fuck this author for being a fucking lazy lard ass, and not finishing this.<br>I bet he doesn't have any fucking illness and is just pimping his money out.</br>  <br> Hisoka's arms getting cut off with sparkles <br>To be fair they may have just done that to keep it consistent with the guy's arms being cut off by him in the exam arc.</br></br>  <br> I bet he doesn't have any fucking illness and is just pimping his money out. <br>Didn't he get back surgery earlier this year? He might still be recovering.<br>Also i don't think money's much of an issue for Togashi, YYH made him rich and he's married to Sailor Moon's author.</br></br></br>  <br>Bait thread aside, is this anime really supposed to be good? Looks like some kiddie shit for 12 years old to me.</br>  <br>Yes , i'm not sure , but it seem to me that the timeslot changed .</br>  <br> Looks like some kiddie shit for 12 years old to me. <br>It is</br></br>  <br>Starts light, gets heavier. It's still battle shounen but one of the darker ones.</br>  <br>It would have been a great series if the creatord hadn't sold out to SJWs and made the cute catGIRL a "ambiguous genderfluid".</br>  <br> the guy's arms being cut off by him in the exam arc <br>I wonder if that's the scene that suffered the most from censorship.</br></br>  <br>I honestly think it was fine because it still fit Hisoka's "theme". I really didn't like how they changed the scene of him systematically slitting like 8 dude's throats to him just spinning in a circle and them just falling over though.</br>  <br>It's not anbiguous , HE's definitely an ant , no't a boy or a girl .</br>  Anime 2011 was great for his animation , design and OST ( except opening) , but yes he suffers to the censorship , but it's a constant problem in all anime adaptation .  <br>I'm sure HxH 2030 won't suffer from these problems.</br>  The worst censorship moment , it's when franklin shoot mafia guys , in the anime , his bullets are similar to tennis balls when they touch them .https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2K<wbr>YgtIRDev4</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I want to pound this cute cat girl until I fill every single one of her orifices with my seed.</br>  <br>Now is not the time to sexualize Pitou, anon.</br>  <br>When then?</br>  <br>I forgot how bad it was. Which is funny, considering how graphic they made the following episode.</br>  <br>Never.

They both had a few great scenes though.</br>  <br>Zoldyck family arc was pretty bland and I didn't like greed island because of all the boring fucking explaining of the game and the villain was lame.

It doesn't stand on its own and the only thing it has going for it is the material it's adapting. Other than that it's a bland, poorly directed adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Chimera Ant or Heavens Arena</br>  <br> it doesn't stand on its own <br><br>It has more closure than the source material will ever have, the anime actually has an "end" even if the source material is ongoing. Most adaptations that don't cover the entire source leave the viewer wanting more if they haven't read the source, but to someone who hadn't read the source, HxH's adaptation has an actual ending. Honestly, if you're saying the adaptation isn't good, you're just being an elitist mangafag, or being one of the "AM I FITTING IN YET?" /a/ fags, because if you judge it objectively, it was a far better adaptation than most.</br></br></br>  <br> GA <br> HA </br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if you're describing him correctly, but what you described is a sociopath, not a psychopath, you uneducated, worthless piece of subhuman waste.</br>  <br>oh boy, there's this faggot again</br>  <br>It really isn't, it isn't good on its own. What makes it good is the material it's adapting it however fails to stand on its own.

It's the same as saying that '99 is great not because of the actual quality of the show but because it actually ends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>1. The point I addressed had nothing to do at all with the quality of the work.<br><br>2. 99 was great because it had good direction, but it did NOT have closure the way 2011 does, it ended because it ran out of source material. 2011 also ended because it had no more source material, the difference is that 2011 had a spot to end that actually felt like an ending whereas 99 did not.</br></br></br>  <br> fantastic music placement and timing <br> highest quality animation in a TV anime <br> masterful storyboarding <br> excellent pacing <br> completely faithful; nothing is left out and scenes and characters are presented exactly as the manga <br> improved character designs <br> lively color scheme <br>Are you stupid? It's the best adaptation anyone could ask for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>made me laugh/10</br>  <br>1. Well that's to bad because that's what people are talking about when they say it doesn't stand on its own. Every adaptation ends, an adaptation ending doesn't mean it stands on its own.<br><br>2. 2011 doesn't really have closure either, it ran out of source material too. Hence why it started introducing the dark continent. That is why your statement is false.<br><br><br> Except the music timing is terrible <br> sure if you like a lot of still shots <br>  source material <br> That's the source material and even then Chimera Ant arc was terribly paced <br> Kite, Kon, Gon's situation with his family, Leorio, and quite a few scenes were actually cut <br> the character designs were terrible <br> That didn't match the tone <br>If you lack taste</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon i'm pretty sure that second post you replied to was ironic</br>  <br>I sincerely hope it was, but I've actually seen people who really believe that shit.</br>  <br>he hates the enemies of people he's on good terms with</br>  <br>probably the best way to put it tbh</br>  <br> That's the source material and even then Chimera Ant arc was terribly paced <br>The pacing in general sucks. Slow start, some well-paced episodes, second half of Yorkshin is rushed, and all of Greed Island is rushed.</br></br>  <br>What makes it worse is that they tended to rush past things that helped build characterization if they didn't skip it entirely.</br>  Enough about bad adaptations<br><br>Here's one that succeeds on its own merits</br></br>  <br>Can I watch this without reading the manga at all?</br>  <br>From what I remember the anime extends parts in the Dark Tournament and removes the last part of the manga. But it's been a while.<br><br>Both are worth it though.</br></br></br>  <br> all he did was kill your shitty waifu. <br>Who did he kill?</br></br>  <br>baro, how i miss her so</br>  How do you feel about Ging?  <br>I found it hilarious how anticlimatic his introduction was, the threads for when he showed up were fun. He also lived up to the hype without him being in any fight which is really satisfying.<br>He's also a pretty good character so far, i like him a lot.</br></br>  <br> Highly flawed while also being likeable and qt <br>I love him</br></br>  <br>I might be going to prison for 7 years so I know that at least when I get out there will be at least 7 more chapters of Berserk and about 40 chapters of HxH. So it's not all bad right?</br>  What I've always wondered is why they had to reboot the series instead of just doing an OVA series for the CA arc. No need to censor a thing.  <br> I might be going to prison for 7 years <br>You should be happy that you didn't get 20, you fucking pedophile cunt. I hope someone releases the word out in the prison that you are there for reading lolicon hentai and the big Tyrone's and Jamal's beat you to a pulp (child molesters are treated like the lowest of the low scum in prisons).</br></br>  <br>If someone hired Killia's dad or brother to kill his aunt. He would murder entire Killua's family</br>  <br> I might be going to prison for 7 years <br>I hope you're one of those Killuafags.</br></br>  <br>what did you do</br>  <br>I know, anon. One glance at the four protagonists and I thought this was Yugioh/Beyblade tier stuff.<br><br>But yeah. It's actually pretty great.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Haha try cult of marijuana ya fucking scumbags but dont worry I'm sure Ill be able to supply everyone with all the cartoon porn they want.</br></br>  <br>See . He goes to prison for being a lolicon.</br>  <br>Let my medical marijuana card expire and then got searched.<br>Everything was siezed at my facility and then my apartment was searched and siezed took over a thousand dollars in cash and close to 300 in medicine.<br>Luckily I have my doctor recomendation from april of this year so im protected under certain statutes to a point but i had more plants than i was legally alllowed to grow.</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck anon. Maybe there'll be a couple of new chapters by the time you're out.</br>  <br>Nobody believes you, lolipedo.</br>  <br>The best part about it is that you'll have a nice amount of chapters to look forward to.</br>  <br><br>That's exactly what I've been thinking.</br></br>  <br>Did they find your child cartoon porn in your computer</br>  <br>Don't be delusional , you will have just 20 chapters or something like that .</br>  <br>We got around 90 chapters in the last 7 years</br>  <br>Oh gosh take me back. This was when I first got into these fucking cartoons, back when Toonami was getting its start.</br>  <br>I hope so much , but togashi write 5 chapters per years .</br>  <br>That's what happens when you're raised by a single mother.</br>  <br>he wasn't raised by a single mother though</br>  <br>Not that far. The anime will probably be back next decade and Togashi will finish the story alongside Madhouse or whatever studio, a la Toriyama post 2013.</br>  <br> Sharing a sign with Killua <br>Feels good</br></br>  <br>Eric meem you've been pushing there anon</br>    <br>But he was :/</br>  <br>Seriously. Just look at how deranged he is.</br>  <br><br>Seeing this stubble reminds me of the bathroom. This shit's annoying.</br></br>  <br>lmao Gon shows how fucked up he is later.</br>  <br>That's Gon's lastest appearance in the manga you secondary scum</br>  <br> 'lmao' <br> not knowing that this is from one of the last chapters </br></br>  <br>Out.</br>  People who don't love Gon are stupid heads  <br>I love him too  ;_; </br>  <br>Killua doesn't care about Gon.</br>  <br>I wish this meme would go away</br>  that Pitou girl has actually pretty shitty hentai<br><br>I am disappointed</br></br>  <br> meme </br>  <br>HxH in general severely lacks  straight  porn.</br>  In a couple of hours. <br>And then another long 7-day wait.<br>Will this suffering ever end?</br></br>   Will this suffering ever end? <br>No ones forcing you to watch this pile of shit.</br>  <br>  no robot angels were harmed in the making of this episode. <br>Blatant lies.</br></br>  <br> Will the butthurt ever end? <br>The post.</br></br>  <br>Time to get sp00ky</br>  Overlord has the best opening this season. Prove me wrong.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jMo<wbr>VmSV4yA8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>best ed too</br>  <br>I just caught up with the anime after getting some time, but compared to the LNs it's quite lacking.<br><br>Those certain scenes were great though, but as far as an actual anime goes it's at least as bad as Mahouka and Vanadis was, actually probably worse.<br><br>Is it weird of me to think that to properly get everything right they would need to like, slow the pace down even more? As it is they are cutting away dialogue or exposition at every turn just to make it in time but I also understand that lots and lots of talking would bore casuals even if they come complete with diagrams or flash backs during monologues and what not. Ah fuck it there's no point wondering about what could have been when this is clearly a cheap commercial where the budget is focused on certain scenes and being an outlet for So-Based to draw some more shit. Guess I'm happy with that.<br><br>Wonder how BDs will work though, it doesn't seem like they are censoring much, what would it even offer to make people buy it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Auto-tune, so by default, it's garbage</br>  <br>I haven't watched much this season, but I remember when the first PV trailer came out I thought it was absolute shit due to how it was horribly out of place with the animation and the song started without the proper build up.<br><br>It's great in the OP though.</br></br></br>  <br>The LN's have way too much text talking about ''this skill and that skill and that item'' but ultimately its useless since Momonga is the only one who is aware of it.</br>  <br>Welcome to LN adaptations, they can't just put all the monologuing in or it'd take up an entire episode.</br>  <br> Getting to about a 700000 views in about 3 weeks. <br>How?</br></br>  <br>people like a good power fantasy see<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Bd<wbr>b1V0Io_g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Yeesh, and that's just the preview?</br>  <br>I hope the opening is gonna be dope too</br>  Is it time for<br><br> KOTAE WA DOKO EEEEEEEEEEEEE? </br></br>  <br>SAGASHITEEEEEEEE</br>  <br>Why is it useless? There's tons of context to it that change how you would interpret the scene itself. This is proven by how many shitters there are in these threads since the anime started asking for explanations.<br><br><br>Yes I know this isn't my first LN, however I can safely say that compared to other adaptations Overlord seems the least capable of being self contained when cutting away content. I think the best examples of this are SAO and Raildex, where even though I know there's a shit ton of things I missed out since I've read the LNs first, it's not all that awkward for whatever reasons.<br><br>Might just be how Overlord was written I dunno. Not saying it's bad, just saying as a stand alone anime instead of being a highlight reel it's awfully jarring. I'd be completely lost if I didn't read the LN and get misconceptions everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it actually looks creepy</br></br>  <br>With my soul</br>  <br> reads shitty shounen lns <br> complains about adaptations <br>nigga</br></br></br>  <br> Why is it useless? There's tons of context to it that change how you would interpret the scene itself. <br><br>Nah from what I read its mostly useless shit noone cares about. (muh skills muh stats).<br><br> This is proven by how many shitters there are in these threads since the anime started asking for explanations. <br><br>They ask about things not yet explained, understandable since its still early. <br><br><br>All in all I believe the anime is really good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't feel like that at all when I watched, neither did my friends who had never even heard of Overlord.</br>  <br> I'd be completely lost if I didn't read the LN and get misconceptions everywhere. <br><br>literally everything is explained<br><br>what the hell is your problem?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I pointed out adaptations that I thought were self contained, and coincidentally, they were the ones that sold very well. Probably because being self contained allows an adaptation to reach a new audience. I mean your very picture is an example of that which I missed.<br><br><br>We'll just have to agree to disagree then, cause if I'm going to be honest I flat out disagree with your post but I'm not gonna bother going back through vol 1 line by line for this. Feel free to BTFO of me though if you are inclined to start quoting lines for each scene though.<br><br><br>I don't see how that's possible when you cut half the text in quotation marks out, not even counting the text not in quotations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Were you raped by a skeleton when you were young?</br>  <br> I don't see how that's possible when you cut half the text in quotation marks out, not even counting the text not in quotations. <br><br>because anime is about pictures, not text</br></br></br>  <br>I did wear a skeleton costume when I was a little kid.</br>  while re-reading vol 1 of the LN I noticed that Ainz defined a minor potion as an item that "only" restores 50 HP... but that cannot be as his total HP is 60 and even his strongest level 100 physical class servants cap at 100 HP. so what am iI missing? did the author retconned his shit?  <br>You do know I was referring to dialogue right? The characters talk when that happens.</br>  <br>The 60 is not 60 hp. It's more like 60% of the normal soft-cap so to speak.</br>  <br>ah ok thanks, that makes sense</br>  <br> kid inside skeleton as opposed to skeleton inside kid <br>Beat them at their own game, eh? That's sheer genius.</br></br>  <br>Yeah we don't know exact numbers anon, nor how the stat chart really works. But you can see how fucked up Ainz's mana bar is when it literally goes off the section.</br>  <br>Is Overlord any good?</br>  <br>What happens if the skeleton inside your body tries to kill you?</br>  <br>I think it's called 'bone cancer'.</br>  <br>spooky</br>  <br>there's something else that baffles me: I used to think that the battle maids were the strongest NPC group after the guardians, Sebas and Pandora's actor but then in volume 4 we learn of the existence of cocytus' level 100 servants who are supposedly stronger. so how many damn level 100 NPC are in Nazarick? also, as we know that Ainz can conjure level 80+ monsters, is it safe to say that battle maids are useless power wise?</br>  <br>AOTD</br>  <br>Too spooky for me.</br>  <br>I don't know where you get level 100 from, cause I've never read anywhere that Nazarick has level 100 nameless npcs other than possibly the Avatara.<br><br>However, there are plenty of level 90 npcs, like the dragons Aura and Mare ride. Demiurge's 7th floor supposedly has a level 90 that is stronger than the weaker floor guardians giving you a glimpse of how RP-mode Nazarick actually is when it doesn't involve the 8th floor.<br><br>If you read the first vol you should know that the battle maids are merely there to stall time on the 9th floor along with Sebas while the players of AOG revive at the 10th floor in order to make their last stand in a Final Boss fashion.</br></br></br></br></br>  Choose your destiny.    <br><br>Whoa, that's too spooky anon.</br></br>  What qualifies as a non human? Touch Me is just a guy with a mask, another dude is a birdman  <br>Touch me is draconian.</br>  <br>Has it actually been confirmed?</br>  <br>Ghost Skeleton<br>Top Hat<br>Flight<br>Time Travel<br>Underwater Ruins<br>Kelly Goldstein<br><br>Dr. Bones<br>Fitz<br>Patches<br>Diary<br>Lesbian Rally<br><br>It'd be an amazing adventure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not in the translated novels so far at least.</br>   Justice has Arrived. <br><br>How much did this special effect cost I wonder.</br></br>  <br><br>Why was his name Touch Me?</br></br>  <br>is that really enough to be a non human?

So I guess his fears were true after all.</br>  <br>I doubt I'll sleep tonight after seeing this.</br>  <br>The maids are formation fighters, on their own they crumble really fast but together they'll make you stand in one place until the big boys manage to put their boots on.</br>  <br>He probably a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show.</br>  <br>Which is really weird cause their youngest resides on the only floor that matters.

AFTER THE ED.!!!!!!  <br>Nope, there it is</br>  <br>Oh, nvm, there it is lol</br>  Meh not much happened this ep huh  There it is!    <br><br>W-what was it?</br></br>  Torrent when  Fuck just got in the stream and already DONT YOU LOVE ME WITH PASSION  Good stuff. Kinda wish they put in the Neuronist bit though.  Hmm, although a bit rushed, it could have gone a lot worse. Not a bad episode. <br><br><br>either read the novel or watch the episode later.</br></br></br>  <br> this bait <br>I can see people falling for it.</br></br>    <br>Hour or so.</br>  <br>Subs when?</br>  <br> left to right <br>pls fix</br></br>  <br>See, the helmet fucks up the whole armor design. They could have put a little bit more thought into it. Although she's cute without it too.</br>  <br>Demiurge misunderstanding Ainz "I'd like this jewel box lol" for "Nazarick, I order you to conquer this world for me"</br>  <br>which sets in motion a ton of bullshit later that Ainz doesn't even know about.</br>  <br> It's weird, this episode felt rushed, but nothing of importance was omitted. <br>I guess you can say this episode is pretty bare bones.</br></br>  What happened to Gazef and Ainz meeting after the battle? Did they skip it?  <br> he doesn't wait till the season finished airing <br><br>Pleb, plebs all of you.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't even show him killing those mages. Shitty cg without gore is just shitty cg.</br>  <br>A new kind of censoring mayhaps?</br>  <br>Well, he's not totally wrong. In terms of plot progression, not a whole lot happened. The fight was fun, sure, but the information gathered to time spent ratio was pretty low.</br>  It sounds like they cut out on the whole Slane Theocracy doctrine and Six Gods stuff, but I suppose that'll be put during the next few episodes?  <br>budum tsh</br>  <br>When the death knight killed those soldiers that looked cool. But this time it was just cardboard angels getting pulled around on strings.</br>  <br>it kinda distrupts the flow of battle<br>still better to put them in non action scenes</br></br>    <br>Of course it did, and people here don't think it's important so no one cares. Just like everything else.</br>    <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Ainz declared the goal of Nazarick, Demiurge's misunderstanding has set the whole show on the road. The plot has started in earnest. Just because it wasn't spelled out doesn't mean nothing happened.</br>  <br>not to mention they skipped the part where he trys to force conscript Ainz.</br>  <br>Cute. Flustered Albedo is the best.</br>  <br>it wasnt really that important though</br>  <br>It shows they didn't part on bad terms and Ainz has a connection in the Kingdom he can exploit. The way it ended, sure you can assume Gazef is eternally grateful but there's really no confirmation.</br>  HorribleSubs is out.  <br>It's sad cause a lot of the fun is the monologue/dialogue hype up and getting to see how everyone overreacts or shits their pants.<br><br>I mean logically speaking, everyone enjoyed the drama cds, yet all it consists of is dialogue and monologue, with the action parts being by far the shittiest since there's no moving pictures. So why the 180 turn on the anime?<br><br>And given how they keep changing up little bits of detail here and there, the drama CDs are more canon than the anime so far.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why? It wouldn't take too long, especially the attempt at forced conscription. Literally just 2 or 3 sentences.</br></br>  4 WEEKS TO HUG  <br>well, he does ask him if he can hire him, but he doesn't ask him the extra two or three times he's supposed to. So meh.</br>  <br> why are drama cds different from anime <br>uhh...... also it's just 13 eps, maybe if it was 50 they could fit all the shit they want but with a short time like that they need to skip the fluff and get on with it</br></br>  <br>Just like how it's not important Nigan compares Ainz with the Black Scripture who is currently guarding the WC robe preparing for the rezzing of the DK who turned out to be a false alarm cause of Sebas, or reveals there's 3 great treasures, or that oh wait none of this is important and will absolutely not come into play in the future.</br>  <br>I guess the anime took a more shounen approach? At least in this episode it did.</br>  <br>Because his build made it so that if you attacked him or did damage to him you took a boatload in retaliation damage. So he was running around advertising it.</br>  So are we mad now that they skip some important parts? Honestly dragging it would take another episode of talking.  <br>Well it's not going to be important since the anime will never reach that point and it's not like anime only watchers have good attention spans.</br>  <br>nah, it doesn't bother me so much. At least they covered the important stuff.</br>  <br>Did they skip Nigan talking about the traitor who stole the miko crown?</br>  <br>I'm confused at how to feel, honestly. On one hand I understand they couldn't adapt the entire thing straight, a few omissions and skipping was guaranteed to happen. On the other hand, stuff like  being omitted confuses me. Is it even possible for them to shoehorn them in the series later?<br>Like there's no reason for Nigun to make any comparisons now when he didn't before.</br></br>  <br>So we aren't even covering volume 3? Cause I'm pretty sure the Black Scripture encounters Shalltear with their WC robe granny.</br>  <br>This ep was already boring as is, if more of it would've been just standing around with CGI birds there would've been no point in making it into an anime. It's just some stupid rpg setting anyways so I don't give much of a shit about muh lore, I wanna see people kill shit.</br>  <br>Nigun talking about this shit directly relates to Clementine in volume 2, a sort of foreshadowing, if you will.</br>  <br>Of course, it's not like it's important or anything and since this is an anime we clearly won't cover what happens to the traitor or what she stole either.</br>  <br> See <br>Looks like you were right.</br></br>  <br>jesus just stop whining already, nobody gives a fuck</br>  <br>What if the her horns aren't so durable looking, and the helmet horns are used to protect them?</br>  <br> lelelele attention span shounenfags xD <br>Nah, I don't mind watching/reading dialogue based stories if they're actually interesting, like haibane renmei, mushishi, monogatari, hyouka etc but when it's just some shitty rpg skellington killing people then I cannot give less of a shit about muh lore.</br></br>  <br>all I'm sayin is that her helmet makes her look like a ruin sentinel and it bugs me. But oh well.</br>  <br>That's why people are agreeing with me of course.</br>  <br> who is clementine? </br>  <br>So when it involves chuunis in real life it's interesting, but when chuunis get transported into their chuuni delusion world it's shit.</br>  <br>What she did in the end is insignificant, same with Nigan's monologues about the treasures and so on.<br><br>Even in novels the Nigans ramblings have yet to play out from the 13H/DG and they havent found out that Ainz destroyed the artifact.<br><br>Same with how Gazef's musing about Ainz and his plea changes nothing. The 3rd vol interlude is far better place to explore the Kingdom's issues and Gazef/factions. Even if they dont play out until 5&amp;6.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>most people are saying they don't give a shit, it's only you and maybe one other guy who keeps crying</br>  <br>Your sarcasm meter is broken go say hello to this faggot </br>  <br>If it's interesting dialogue it's interesting, when it's boring muh powerlevels muh stats shit then I cannot care.</br>  <br>most people are saying they think it's stupid, it's only you and maybe one other guy who keeps sperging out</br>  <br>are you really this autistic? well, I guess you don't need to answer</br>  <br>So you admit you never read the LNs, okay. One more evidence on how secondaries perceive Overlord completely different.</br>  <br>Maybe you'd have a better time reading the novels, then.</br>  <br>there's literally only 2 of you. You and the guy who only watches the anime nobody else agrees with you so stop dodging.</br>  <br>You're a better anon than me. I couldn't find the energy to deal with his stupidity.</br>  <br> tfw secondaries actually believe this is just another SAO/Log Horizon </br>  <br>I've read most of the monogatari novels and almost finished with okitegami kyouko. I don't read shitty shounen novels.</br>  <br>good thing it's mostly interesting dialog and the powerlevel shit doesn't come up much</br>  <br>Here we go.</br>  <br>Thanks for making things clear. And good to know we can ignore any other shit you dump.</br>  <br>Enjoy your SAO 2.0 then scrublord. I hope they cut more worthless shit out and show stuff that people actually want to see.</br>  Why are you retards responding to the ruseman?  <br>Like girls talking to each other trying to sound deep while acting as fap fodder?</br>   not reading the novels for plot and story and watching the anime to see the fight scenes visualized <br><br>Why are some people so retarded that they can't just do it that way? Simply seeing the anime as a help to imagine how some scenes actually would look like is by far the easiest solution.</br></br>  <br> muh battle shounens are so intellectual hurrrhurrrhurr <br>Yeah whatever faggot.</br></br>  <br> muh <br>into the garbage he goes</br></br>  <br>At least nisio's pretentious shit is interesting, oh yeah and I've read most of zaregoto too a while back, unlike muh stats muh world items muh mmorpg</br>     Downloading raws so I can save about 1hr and 40mins of wait for subs <br><br>What monster, have I become?</br></br>  So can we assume that episodes titles from here on out will follow the chapter names 1 to 1?  <br>I'll give a shit about that when an action scene actually rivals Tigre being fancy with his bow.</br>  <br>If you're an LN-fag then you're just watching it for the fight scenes anyways.</br>  <br>Oh I see now I should've realised. After all this another "I'm trapped in an MMORPG golly jee!!" anime. This sort of shit always has the most cancerous and defensive fanbase.</br>  I really wish this show was more about the monsters and less about, you know, humans.  <br>but anon, humans are the monsters</br>  <br>Does she even terminate someone in this form?<br><br>As in  lamprey style ?</br></br></br>  <br> At least nisio's pretentious shit is interesting <br><br>Are you one of those guys that laughs at people cosplaying but wears waifu t-shirts? Cause that's what you look like right now.<br><br>We get it, you let your dick do the talking, there's probably more brain cells down there anyways.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Buddy you better believe it. And it'll get animated, too. </br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br>Humans are both inherently good and evil.<br><br>Thus among them there can even be complete saints...or aforementioned monsters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't leave corpses?</br>  Did i miss the stream?  <br>yes</br>  <br>t-thanks</br>  <br>Good thing overlord isn't filled with sluts, oh wait. Also I know you're just being defensive but seriously you think this battle shit has better writing than nisio? Cmon, don't be a total retard just for the sake of your argument.</br>  <br>The overpowered-relative-to-his-world MC who has inner doubts about his capability<br> Momonga/Kirito/Shiroe <br>The main girl who is introduced as a competent woman but is relegated to romcom antics and never criticizes the MC's decisions even if they're wrong<br> Albedo/Asuna/Akatsuki <br>The other girl who we all know is just there for the forced love triangle tension<br> Shalltear/Suguha/Minori <br>The bumbling sidekick who serves as comic relief for the serious MC<br> Narberal/Klein/Naotsugu <br><br>I am not the anon who claims his taste is better because he reads Monogatari  pfft  because it's still all light novels but you're an idiot if you think Overlord isnt similar to SAO and LH</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's old, rich and married. <br><br>He can spend whatever money he wants</br></br></br>  <br>Raw torrent is out though, and subs should be coming out within like half an hour.</br>  <br>When did I claim that? I'm not you whose so insecure about your shit taste that I gotta keep using buzzwords and fight trends so I can look credible. I'm simply saying you're a fucking hypocrite that's more shallow than your toilet bowl. <br><br>Anyone can see you're shit posting, I'm just replying cause it's funny projecting. I mean you even accuse me of things you do yourself but I haven't.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh many thanks.<br><br>(we need more variations of these, we need a red angry face and a sad face)</br></br></br>    <br>Just don't reply if you can't accept it kid<br><br>I don't even think Overlord's bad</br></br></br>  <br>There are some floating around if you check previous threads. Though I didn't save them because they're pretty low-res.</br>  So do any of the other Maids besides Narbarel get any respectable amount of screen time in the first three volumes of the novels?  <br> fight trends <br>What trends. It's a barely popular show with CGI everywhere, hardly the pinnacle of japanese media. Especially compared to a best seller writer who has some of the most selling series. If someone's a mainstream faggot then that's me.<br>And what's your proof for that? You're just saying that I only read Zaregoto or Okitegami for porn, when there's basically none in them. While this series having the mc fondle a girl's breasts as the first thing. So yeah, you're full of shit. I'm just saying that if they cut stuff in some mmo battle series like this then I cannot give a shit I only watch it for battles anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>I think overlord is pretty fun too, but these guys complaining about muh plot muh lore being toned down and acting like they're the most refined gods is just straight up retardation.</br>  <br>Solution gets a scene and thats about it.</br>  <br>Solution gets a bit.</br>  <br>Where did that green face come from? Was it Touch Me?</br>  <br><br>Well darn. Gonna have to read up on the novel after the anime's over then.</br></br>  <br>we should be on volume 6 when that happens. If nothing happens.</br>  <br>No idea I didn't post it</br>  <br>probably from the flash back.</br>  <br>If you mean from  that emote was in the original scene.</br>  Funimation got it subbed. <br><br>Waiting for rips.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12871228 <br>i love how wrong your comparissons are</br>  How come this show airs so early compared to other anime?  Couldn't this have done without the whole "stuck in an MMORPG" setting?  <br>it's like 11 pm in japan when it airs.</br>  <br>It's aimed at elementary school children and preschool kids.</br>  I stopped reading the LN at the part where the Royal knight was being told it might be a trap.<br><br>I'd swear the translator was just throwing random words together.</br></br>  <br> I stopped at chapter 2 <br><br>what a pleb</br></br></br>  <br>that's pretty early</br>  <br>It's the second best  GATE has a better one </br>  <br>Not being able to read moonrunes is one thing but surely you can read engrish</br>  Subs are out  <br><br><br>Sorry, it's my first time reading an ln. I'm used to reading normal novels so going from perfect grammar to barely intelligible English can be pretty jarring.</br></br></br>  <br>Again, no. The game served a purpose for the New World. Not a purpose some in the NW would be grateful for but still a purpose.</br>  <br>That's a funny way of spelling  Ushio and Tora .</br>  <br> barely intelligible English <br>son, you have no idea what that means when it comes to LNs. Just keep reading. The TLs get better.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Only AT-X is airing this at 11 pm, other channels are airing this around 12 am.</br></br></br>  The time has come, and so have I.  <br><br>Reminder that it's an actual novel and marketed as a regular novel, it being an ln is misinformation that /a/ keeps spreading.</br></br>  <br>What difference does that make?</br>  <br>Then you should read more LNs. I didn't find it that bad. Then again, baring stuff translated by js.exe, most LN translations are way worse in terms of grammar.</br>  <br>『オーバーロード』（OVER LORD）は、丸山くがねによる日本のライトノベル。ウェブ版とKADOK<wbr>AWA エンターブレイン出版の書籍版の2通りがあり、同じ世界観で別の物語となっ<wbr>ている。出版でのイラスレーターはso-bin担当。ウェブ版は2010年<wbr>9月から開始されており基本的設定は同じであるが、書籍版とウェブ版とでは<wbr>別のストーリーとなっている。<br><br> ライトノベル </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br> Later, after Ainz has decided to accept both Albedo and Shalltear's feelings. <br> And Albedo, being first wife, has been reduced to a blissed out stupor of happiness. <br> Ainz summons Shalltear to his secondary personal chambers. <br> Shalltear, blushing but looking hopeful, enters with a flash of teleportation, looking up at Ainz with wide, loving eyes. "Ainz-sama...," she purred, the words full of love and desire. <br> "Shalltear," entoned Ainz, looking positively spooky in his looming ominous perfection. His robes were loose, his mantle shed, but his hood raised in casual fashion. He approached her, raising one skeletal hand to brush her cheek, a touch she recieved like a lover's caress, including a sweet moan, as he stroked her. <br> "Is it my time now, Ainz-sama?," whole body positively quivering with barely restrained desire, Shalltear's voice rose in a plaintive whimper of need. She wanted him so badly. <br> "It is, Shalltear," he confirmed, which to the quivering vampire was like a release, and she leaped up and threw her arms around him. His arms rose to catch her as he held her small body to his taller, the softness of her fake breast padding pressing against his skeletal chest. Her kisses played along his jaw, his teeth, tongue lewdly extending to lick along them and inside. <br> "Oh Ainz!," She moaned as her body clung to him, grinding herself against his hard bones. <br> Holding her in turn, Ainz walked gently to a chair and slid onto it, tucking her into his lap as she continued to explore and worship him, bathing his bones in her saliva and kisses. <br> "I want you to do something for me, Shalltear...," he said softly, that spike of jaw nuzzling into her hair as she kissed and licked his collarbone. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>LNs in general are just pure trash. They read like scripts for plays, with a repetitive narrative that doesn't give breathing room for the reading to think.<br><br> Character A says something <br> Character B replies <br><br>Over and over again, and the actual literature is reserved for scene transitions. I can't stand them because scripts or plays are meant to be acted, or spoken out loud. LN are pieces of filth as a whole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lns are shorter and simpler for young people to read. Think goosebumps compared to a regular horror novel. Both are fine, but there are differences.</br>  <br> "W-what, my master?," she crooned, positively awash with need and love. <br> "Transform." <br> That stopped her cold. She quivered softly, then looked up at her love with big red eyes that looked doubtful, worried, and fearful, as she said in a small voice, "...t-transform? ...but darling... I-- ...I am not pretty or cute in my true form." <br> Looking down into her eyes with a red glow that seemed somehow gentle, he raised his skeletal hands and gently brushed her cheeks. <br> "Shalltear. I have something to prove to you. Something to show you. I asked Albedo to do this as well... will you not do the same?" <br> The challenge, thrown into her teeth like that, was enough to make her bare her teeth. The idea of not being willing to do something Albedo had done for him was not one that sat well for her. Shalltear's features, however, took on a sad cast and she slid from his lap and backed away... "...it is... as you wish... my master..." The words were said in a heartbreakingly pitiful voice as Ainz looked on. <br> The transformation was a sight others, if they beheld it, would find horrifying. Shalltear's true form was not beautiful, nor was it anything short of a nightmare. A red mouth rimmed like a lamprey in teeth. Blood red eyes. Her hair grown long and wild. Her body enlongated and feral, with savage claws at the ends of her fingers and talons on her feet. Shadows clung to her, as if hiding her from him. Her red eyes bloomed with radiant red light as her tongue lashed the air... and then a sound came from her. A sound that could break a heart... ...a pitiful whimpering sound... as hands rose to her face and she turned away from Ainz and seemed about to flee. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who wants to bet 99% of people will miss the part after the ED?  <br>What? Overlord is a web novel turned light novel. It's never been a novel.</br>  <br>-&gt;<br/></br>  <br> To her surprise, however, skeletal hands prevented her from going anywhere. She and Ainz were probably two of the deadliest beings within Nazerick, but he held her hideously transformed form so gently. Lowering her hands, he drew the clawed lengths into his ropes. To touch and rest upon the bones of his hips. Her eyes, glowing through her hair, looked startled, shocked... truly and utterly shocked. Her entire face conveying the abject wonderment of Ainz's actions. Reaching up, he ran skeletal fingers through her hair, barring her face and mouth. <br> "Yes... this is the true you... my Shalltear," And drawing her down with a skeletal hand curled around the back of her head, he pulled her lamprey-like mouth to his own bony mouth, nuzzling into her... Kissing her as only he could. He had no lips to press to her, but the bones of his teeth and jaw and face snuggled into her and against her maw. Opening so lightly to brush his teeth against the sides of her lips. No hesitation was shown in him as he touched her, stroked her... rubbed over her inhuman form with the caresses of a lover despite his skeletal nature. <br> "Aaaaaaainz...saaaaamaaaaaa...," came her voice... full of wonder and sounding, despite the severely hissing quality of her voice, almost cute in its hopefulness. But the next words froze her to the utter immobility only dead things can have as she stared in growing wonder at the skeleton mage before her. </br></br></br>  <br> It's in japanese so it must be correct! </br>  <br>Good thing Overlord is a novel and not a light novel then</br>  <br>more likely to be correct than shit you make up</br>   "Remember, Shalltear... that I love you. Not just the you that you present to us every day in your beautiful and cute dresses. You are a precious jewel to me, my Shalltear... and your true form, as much as your younger form, is beautiful to me. You will never repulse or horrify me. And here..." He raised a hand, and magic pulses. Blood, thick and viscuous, swirls into being over his hand as he raises it up between them. "Let my once living blood, recreated through magic from my once human self, fill you to satisfaction, my beautiful vampire, and seal us together. You are my bride, and I your groom... my Shalltear." <br> The whimper from the disturbing visage that is Shalltear Bloodfallen's true self is... so disconcertingly adorable. The being, the /woman/ known as Shalltear Bloodfallen, had never expected, never hoped for this. Never hoped someone could accept her in such a way. Never hoped someone she loved would love ALL of her. And her tongue writhes across his skull in a loving lick before her head turns to the blood presented. Like it was one mass, her tongue extends and wraps around it, then with a croon... she slurps it in. The blood not wasted in a single droplet... all of it pouring into her lamprey-like mouth as she tilted her head back and held the shorter skeletal man to her elongated body. Her croons and sounds she makes as she drinks and the sounds her body makes as it absorbs her lover's once blood is something that should sound horrifying. But in these moments between two inhuman lovers... it becomes sweet and cute. </br>  <br> Then, with a swirl of darkness, the shape of the True Vampire reverts. Transforming into that smaller, cuter, and yet now altogether naked form that she wears around other beings, her features and eyes full of love and wonder. <br> "You... you... oh Ainz!," She clings to him, tears of blood running down from her red eyes as the utter joy of the moment takes over. <br> Gently, he carries her toward the vast bed. He may not use this room as often, but it was still as much home as the first with its creation meant to be personal and private with this woman as his other bedroom now belonged to Albedo. Darkness swirls around him as he approaches, inacting his own transformation... and suddenly the beautiful vampire girl is not clinging to a skeleton... but a being of flesh. Cold, dead flesh. A vampire. A very male vampire. Handsome and smiling. Clearly undead flesh painted over the bones underneath. Wonder filling Shalltear's eyes as Ainz, now naked as she, presses her down onto the bed and slides atop her. <br> "...Let us... enjoy ourselves... Shalltear...," came Ainz's voice more... dusky... and smooth with flesh enclosing it. <br> Shalltear's beaming smile is radiant, "YES!" <br> What followed after was sweet, intense, loving, and wonderful. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>There.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's literally marketed as a novel, and is twice as long as most ln. People just assume it's an ln because it was originally a wn, and most wns that become published become lns, and also because it involves an mmo and most of those types of stories are lns. In actual book stores it's almost always in novel sections, not ln sections.</br></br>  <br>Cue pandora's actor reverting to base form</br>  <br> Spouts opinions without even reading the material <br> Only reads one phrase of the post <br> Posts worst girl after snake <br>Step up sempai</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cue pandora's actor reverting to base form <br><br>Bah, Ainz is a spellcaster.

Thanks though! It was just a momentary flight of writer's fancy. The idea of two monsters accepting one another for what they truly are not what they disguise themselves to be just appealed to me. And Shalltear getting that kind of treatment by Ainz would be as adorable as it would be horrific considering her true form</br>  <br>such as? I'm pretty sure he's full on board at the latest novel where after his minions goosestepped down the empire's front lawn he's intimidating the entire world for his own independent country. later on I've heard he  massacres an army of 50k that was sent to contest him, and killed Stroganoff </br>  anime only fag here. The episode was good,Gazef guy was great,the music is perfect for the scenes. And the Curbstomp was okày.My only grudge is the CGI but it was tolerable. Was there any cut scenes?  Why did we not get to see it?  <br>Its ln though, its just double the price of a light novel for reasons I can't think off.</br>  Fucking 10/10 episode.

Apparently, they are heading to a place where (as Alibaba has told Judar many times by this point) they can find someone with the power to send them back to their world. He doesn’t know where that is, though, as he just heard he had to aim for a rift in the land.  <br> Judar is intrigued by this “I heard it from someone”, and thinks that certainly Alibaba is... but he doesn’t answer his question, and since he can't read Alibaba's non-existent face, he gets really annoyed. <br> They apparently fight, and their fight leads them to: <br><br> Mother Dragon: We have guests, I see? <br> Alibaba: We were looking for you. My name is Alibaba. What’s your name? <br> Mother Dragon: Long forgotten. But you can call me how Solomon did, Mother Dragon. <br><br> Alibaba reminds Judar that she appeared in Aladdin’s tale about Alma Torran, a name the the dragon finds nostalgic. Still, Judar blatantly and rudely asks her to go straight to the point and tell them how to go back. <br> She tells them they are at the “bottom” of the world, and that they came there through a rift in the dimensions. The dragon has been overlooking Solomon’s new world from here, and the black shadow looming over it, which Alibaba explains is what he wants to stop. <br> The dragon exclaims that Alibaba is strange. He is still young, yet has the presence of an old sage. Alibaba tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what seemed like a hundred years somewhere else, and it was there that he heard about the dragon from a certain someone. <br> She then proceeds to explain that it’s funny that they are talking about “going back” when they actually are in their world. Judar immediately dismisses this as a lie, as the rukh there is all black and it’s totally different from their world. She explains however that this is just the old Alma Torran “attached” to the new world. In other words, the Dark Continent (which seems to be about twice as big as the known world). </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dump?</br>  <br>Nah, go read it here if you want<br>http://www.mangamint.com/magi-275-m<wbr>agi</wbr></br></br>  <br> which seems to be about twice as big as the known world <br><br>More like ten as big.</br></br></br>  <br>is that hunter x hunter all over again</br>  Like the heading mentioned, it is a compatibility and affinity test, its more like what character traits fit into which rukh type the most, it is not a identical 100% match but maybe like a good 70-80% match?

Black rukh is 70% Hakuryuu.</br>  <br>Alibaba is now more than a hundred years old.<br><br>He will be far more mature than his teenage self.<br><br>He is beyond wizard mode already.</br></br></br></br></br>  Just a few things from the chinese scans<br><br>- Judar noted that since they are looking for someone, it would make sense for them to look at an elevated position but the weird things is the more they go up, the darker the sky is to the point where they could not see the ground at all<br><br>-Alibaba says that he dont know where this person is but he had been marking around from a starting point and hopefully will be able to find that person this way<br><br>-Origin dragon noted that Alibaba though has a very young life form yet she can feel a very old presence in him<br><br>-Alibaba states before he reached the dark world, he was at somewhere else and since he is only a spirit, his concept of time at that place is that of a 100 year, Judar starts to wonder what is Alibaba now ever since being taken out by Hakuryuu, what happened to him between then and now<br><br>-that dark world they speak of is the southern part of the dark continent</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> his teenage self. <br>He's like 20 by now. Time is actually passing in Magi you know.</br></br>  <br>Subs never<br><br>Better than A-1 shit series</br></br></br>  I'm looking forwards to this more mature Alibaba, but I hope he doesn't lose his silly side completely.   Sumomomo Momomo: The Strongest Bride on Earth <br> Magi: The Oldest Virgin on Earth <br><br>I see a pattern there, Ohtaka</br></br></br>  <br> The Oldest Virgin on Earth <br>That would be Ithnan</br></br>  <br> &gt;Sumomomo Momomo: The Strongest Bride on Earth <br>Is this series any good?</br></br>  <br> HxH did it first </br>  I wonder if besides maturity he'll get some power up too. I mean, it seems he has been fighting for a long time in spirit form. Maybe that increased his magoi capacity or some shit like that.  <br>Isn't Ugo older?</br>  <br>But he's never been on earth</br>  <br>His Djinn body was.</br>  <br>toriko too</br>  Who would have thought that getting stabbed through the head would lead to you becoming a sage.   mfw Judar got Kars'd   <br>Good but kind of rushed.</br>  <br>Ohtaka has grown a lot since then, it's not great but it's worth a read.</br>  <br> She then proceeds to explain that it’s funny that they are talking about “going back” when they actually are in their world. <br>This seems too easy.</br></br>  Oh so they just ended up in the dark continent  <br>Maybe they'll find hiatusxhiatus in there</br>  <br> 100 year spirit power up  <br>I hope Alibaba remembers to thank Hakuryuu for giving him a free super power up</br></br>  Will they  get on the boat?   <br> Tic Tac and edgemaster chapter <br>Why can't we get more of glorious Sinbad?</br></br>  <br>black ruck is 100% Sinbad</br>  <br> Alibaba tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what seemed like a hundred years somewhere else <br>Lame.<br><br>Off-screen development is just lazy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the whole thing was a set up for Alibaba power up and some revelations.</br>  <br><br>People would just bitch again like with Alma toran.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure about that. The biggest problem of Alma Thoran was the all new cast. <br><br>Here it would be like 100 years of Alibaba suffering which everyone likes.</br></br></br>   Over a 100 years old. <br> Still a virgin. <br>Holy fuck.</br></br>  <br>We are going to see it? Like it said here" Judar starts to wonder what is Alibaba now ever since being taken out by Hakuryuu, what happened to him between then and now".</br>  <br>Blame Sinbad for being too broken. Without off-screen development Alibaba would never catch up to him.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I honestly don't see anyone beating Sinbad in a one-vs-one fight. If anything it would still be an everyone vs Sinbad fight.<br><br>Especially once he goes full David.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't need to catch up to Sinbad, and if he does, he will be just a Gary Stu, as he will be Sinbad but without all the bad shit like being a manipulative fucker or final boss.</br>  Reminder that Alibaba technically was the first metal vessel user death   Alibaba is now older than Sinbad and Kouen <br>Thats neat.</br>  <br>Current Sinbad is not that strong, for example I think Aladdin plus Kouen ( or even only Aladdin) could defeat him right now.<br><br> Especially once he goes full David. <br><br>I have a theory that once Sinbad falls completely into depravity David will be awaked.</br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder how Judar will change after all this. We all know Alibaba will still be just Alibaba but wiser.  <br>fuck off, you got your shoujo-bait sinbad spin-off.</br>  <br> Alibaba tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what seemed like a hundred years somewhere else, and it was there that he heard about the dragon from a certain someone. <br>Is this suppose to ring some bells? Or is Alibaba saying since Hakuryuus fight it seems as if its been 100 years?</br></br>  I wonder what alibaba's plans for love are now.<br>Is he going to flip out even more because he'll be experiencing hormones and boners for the first time in a lifetime?<br>And has he finally realised his OTP is  Aladdin ?</br></br>  <br> this is just the old Alma Torran “attached” to the new world. In other words, the Dark Continent (which seems to be about twice as big as the known world). <br>And just why couldn't Aladdin get some idea and clue about where Alibaba was sent to after all that Solomon's wisdom?</br></br>  <br>Solomon didn't make the new world so he wouldnt know where it is.</br>  <br>Alibaba has shed his mortal body, and with it his mortal desires. <br><br>Boner has no more power over him.<br><br>Alibaba has become the superior existence David has been thinking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ugo*</br>  <br>yeah but his goal is to unshed it and climb back in his chemical suit.<br>I thought it might be like going off weed for a while to lose your built up tolerance.</br></br>  <br> Alibaba tells her that before, when he became a spirit, he spent what seemed like a hundred years somewhere else, and it was there that he heard about the dragon from a certain someone. <br>What does he mean "before"?<br>When he says "seemed like a hundred years" does that mean it literally went on for years of perceived time or was he just reallly bored?</br></br></br>   i still want to believe   <br>They are just too awesome for this gay world</br>  <br> What does he mean "before"? <br>Before metting the dragon<br><br> When he says "seemed like a hundred years" does that mean it literally went on for years of perceived time or was he just reallly bored? <br>Literally perceived 100 years. Like hyperbolic time chamber.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After Hakuryuu "killed" him but before meeting Judar. The time between those events.</br>  I don't know how to feel now that I'm aware all this spacebros adventure time has actually been just a blink of an eye in the other side.<br>Fucking ``Select all images with cactus.'' captcha doesn't help.</br>  <br>I would prefer time to flow differently in their world, but I guess this means Judar and Alibaba will come back to  stop the war </br>  <br> stop the war <br>No need to, fucking Sin already Bad the deed. <br>Baba is even at the risk of losing his arranged waifu deal with Kouen.</br></br></br>  <br> muh spacebros <br> 1st thread didn't even reach 100 and the 2nd one already dying <br>So where did all the spacebrofags go</br></br></br>  Last thread, this will take a while.<br><br>We've got Best Blue, Black Clover, and Birth of an Exorcist.<br><br>Three Bs. I just noticed that.<br><br>Birth of an Exorcist is a special look at chapter 1 with tank scans this week. It's been running for a little while, I think, though I don't know in what magazine. It's actually in my backlog; maybe chapter 1 will convince me to pick it up.<br><br>Black Clover was...surprisingly alright this week. I haven't read Best Blue yet. Let's check it out together.<br><br>Boku no Hero Academia <br>Shokugeki no Souma <br>World Trigger </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I completely forgot the subject line, for archive diving: this is a WSJD thread.</br>  Don't worry, healthy girl; this is a Weekly Shounen Jump sports series- HE'S PROBABLY GAY    <br>man this page is so gay, I don't even</br>                  <br>Cool, it's this character archetype. Wouldn't be a sports series without one.</br>      <br>Christ, this is sooooo bland and generic.<br><br>I mean, it's not painful; it's more like it's not ANYTHING.</br></br></br>  The fact that in the survey they asked if readers would be interested in reading other sports manga gives me hope they could start haikyuu    <br>Is Haikyuu at all gay?</br>  <br>Or that Sumo manga.</br>        <br>A little bit. The big difference is that it's actually good.</br>  That was chapter 3 and thus the last chapter we'll be getting for a while if ever.<br><br>I...really don't care about this series. If you're like me and also think this is like the plain white bread of sports manga, maybe try going to shonenjump.viz.com/issue-survey and in the "suggestions" box at the end suggest they add some other WSJ manga to the English magazine. I suggested Straighten Up. For one thing, that series is going to obviously fucking SURVIVE. It's been positively murdering the rankings.<br><br>DDL: http://www70.zippyshare.com/v/kLTeZ<wbr>Mmo/file.html<br><br><br>I may actually check it out, then.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  Alright, Black Clover.      <br>K-Kubo?</br>  The brown amazon tomboy mage is the only one I care about in this group.<br><br>Also, this and the next two pages are kind of clever. Summarizing like this is a not contrived way to exposit character details. I think it goes on a little long, though, and typically I prefer the "show" method instead of "tell"when it comes to learning characters.</br></br>      <br>does it look like he's gone crosseyed in his need to burn evildoers?</br>    I get the feeling the Wizard King is going to turn out to have been born a peasant or some shit.  Asta, this is your in: fuck Mimosa and enter the noble bloodline. Seriously, she's better than Noelle anyway.  <br>i feel like if he did, he hid his background somehow. The nobles seem too unaccepting of frontier village folks to be ruled by a peasant</br>    <br>Oh yeah, and I'll go ahead and make the obvious joke.<br><br>Yes, Asta, Mimosa is after the meat.</br></br></br>          <br>what the fuck man<br>that hair is the dumbest hair i've. . .just. . .it's too dumb. can't think. hair. stupid. fuck. jesus.</br></br>  <br>Also, he seems to be wearing a dress.</br>  RIGHT ON THE TABLE  <br>I do believe that one's supposed to be a woman.<br><br>It confused me too.</br></br></br>  <br>holy christwagons you're right<br>I was so stunned by the stupid hair. . .i thought that was the sister.</br></br>    <br>no no no, look closer. the one with the dress has the stupid hair thing</br>  Quite the declaration, Asta; I like it. Very "call the cops, I don't give a fuck" of you. Much better than "I'm gonna be the Wizard King!" and that's it.  <br>but anon. . .they ARE the cops</br>  <br> Black Clover was...surprisingly alright <br><br>shit OP Detected Black Clover is a worse revision of Naruto without the facade of ninja<br>I want to be hokage!<br>I am gonna be Magic King!</br></br></br></br></br>  Birth of an Exorcist<br><br>I know very little about this.</br></br>  <br> I'll become the Hokage, so that everyone respects me, dattebayo!! <br>Pls no, japan fuck your taste</br></br>    <br>main girl is cute, that's a good start</br>  <br>It is a prequel fwi anon.There son is there OP character there just prequel for world beating once one the son is born one them will die and the sequel will talk about there son jesus!</br>  <br>To be fair, this isn't exactly about respect but more like "I'll prove you're full of shit and then walk all over you."</br>  <br>It's by the Binbougami author.<br>It's also published in France.</br></br>  <br>Sousei no Onmyouji, from the binbougami ga! maker. i think it's currently at chapter 22.</br>  <br>Your post is sadly mostly incomprehensible to me.<br><br><br> It's also published in France. <br>The fuck? How'd that happen?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This shit already has multiple chapters translated but it seems like whoever was doing it dropped it. Made me sad, I liked it.</br>  <br>Okay, I kind of get it: it's actually "Twin Star Exorcists" and "Birth of an Exorcist" is this prequel chapter here? Or, possibly, it's just the name of the chapter?<br><br>My bad.</br></br></br>  <br>cxc scans didn't dropp it, they are just slow.</br>    <br>its the firsty chapter</br>  <br> Probably <br>Def.</br></br>  <br> naruto, naruto <br>kill yourself</br></br>    <br>Uhh France is like the country of comics, tons of manga are published there.</br>  <br>Well it... kinda happened.<br>Was very surprised myself.</br></br>  <br>Wanna know some bullshit? The short guy should neve rbe able to compete against that tall guy. Unless he's got ginormous hands and foots. Else, he'd be at too much a physiological disadvantage.</br>  Name one character that can beat or even kill this guy.<br><br>pro tip: you cant</br></br>  <br>Her power seems to be time travel to childhood rape so I'd they that would one up Vald.</br>  berserker armor guts      <br>Oh? he doesn't look that strong. Kidd will murder him.</br>  <br>The Accelerator.</br>  beat? van helsing, the major. And it's canon.  Muh dara <br>He can kek ei</br>  <br>I always wondered how Van Helsing could have taken him down, another prequel would be cool</br>  <br>SSJGSSJ Goku</br>  <br>worlds best dad reporting in</br>  <br> thread </br>  How can any of these guys kill something that cant even die and can shift between any dimension?  Nero Chaos or Arcueid would fuck him up.   <br>Well, after hellsing ultimate, he apparently exists as some sort of large-scale quantum system. All you have to do is collapse the wave function at the right time, and he will cease to exist as long as there is an observer.</br>  Anime only? In that case<br>Magic gods<br>Aleister crowley<br>Madoka (EOS)<br>Any gold cloth saint <br>Beerus<br>Dark scheneider<br>One punch man<br>STTGL<br>and I could name many many more</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there a character that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH Madara Uchiha? Let alone defeat him. And I’m not talking about Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara. I’m not talking about Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara either. Hell, I’m not even talking about Juubi Jinchuuriki Gedou Rinne Tensei Uchiha Madara with the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan doujutsus (with the rikodou abilities and being capable of both Amateratsu and Tsukuyomi genjutsu), equipped with his Gunbai, a perfect Susano’o, control of the juubi and Gedou Mazou, with Hashirama Senju’s DNA implanted in him so he has mokuton kekkei genkai and can perform yin yang release ninjutsu while being an expert in kenjutsu and taijutsu.  <br> battle shonen <br>wrong thread autist</br></br>  <br>Hirano is too busy with evil Jesus to make another Hellsing.</br>  I'm pretty sure that Enel can just create enough volts to kill all the souls in Alucard at once.    <br> name one character that could beat him <br>not<br> name one character from a slice of life or edgy angsty teenager drama show or entry level anime with less than 100 episodes that could beat him </br></br></br>  She gets some really OP cards by the end of the manga, also Clow could easily kill Alucard.  <br>Are his eyes towards his nose or something?</br>  <br> childhood rape <br>She's a bit late for that.</br></br>  <br>Mr. infinity.</br>  Inferno Cop.  <br>The explanation for Hellsing beating Alucard was Alucard wasn't as strong back then due to the Hellsing organization experimenting on him but his old form was stronk as fuck anyway so Van Hellsing was still likely a complete and utter badass. <br><br>But I sorta doubt Van hellsing being completely human since Anderson was a regenerator before he turned into that tree thing and alucard still considered him 'human' so it's all ambiguous.</br></br></br>  <br> Go to rape kiddy vlad <br> "This is a male only boyslut young woman, please try next mosque!" </br></br>  <br>Last time I checked vlad's desire was being beaten by humans (namely: You don't go monster mode. Regenerator is OK he knows he'll squish you easily. Going treemode is NOT Ok.) so he kinda and sneakily jobs.</br>  <br>It was like 4 guys who took down Alucard. <br>I don't remember if they were named.</br></br>  didnt the neko guy who looked like a girl made alucard disappear?  <br>I'm pretty alucard absorbed Schrodinger (Neko guy) and became omnipotent or some shit.</br>  <br>Didn't Integra's father beat him?<br>That's why he's loyal to the Hellsing's</br></br>    <br>*omnipresent<br>He is not omnipotent but has reality warping powers</br></br>  How can you kill something thats neither real or not real?  <br>Madara?<br><br>Are we talking about THE madara uchiha?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually while we're here, would Imagine Breaker do anything to a vampire like Alucard?</br>  Flash  <br>don't start this shit again in this thread.</br>  You can't "kill" Schroedinger Alucard because non-existence is a valid state for him <br><br>His offensive power is limited though</br></br>  <br>he can certainly beat him, but not kill him.</br>  <br>Imagine Breaker is exclusively defensive. Since Alucard has no passive barriers or the like, I would assume not.</br>  <br>what</br>  <br>Alucard has nothing to dispel. Imagine Breaker is useless against characters like him.</br>  <br> can't even make a penalty kick <br> beating alucard <br><br>lol no</br></br></br></br>  I wish I could dislike people to death. That way every faggot that starts powerlevels threads would be in hell by now.  <br>His son.<br><br>Its his destiny.<br><br> Integra is D's mom. She had him before the world ended and Alucard took over in the ruined world after. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Growing up with 'Aunt Seras'. <br> Getting boob cuddles and hair ruffles and tossed around <br> Get your virginity stolen by her. </br></br></br>  Better Man  <br>You must be new here</br>  <br>boku no pico</br>  The Flash is the strongest because he's the fastest. How fast? The world is a frozen puppet show and the Flash is moving every particle one by one.  <br> Nero <br>He only has 666 lives while Alucard has millions</br></br>  I mean Alucard is technically an Homunculus if you think about it (he can kill him the same way he killed Lust and almost killed Envy). <br><br>unless you're talking about Schrodinger Alucard who technically doesn't exist</br></br>    <br>Weakest bait of the year.</br>  Literally any character that can throw Alucard into space.<br>Jojo already gave the answer to how to stop immortal beings more than 25 years ago.</br>  <br>He exists as long he believes he exists. You could beat him if you talk him into thinking he isn't real. It could work as long he doesn't decide he should just attack you.</br>  <br>bobobo is always the answer.</br>  <br>Unlike Cars, Alucard could improvise propulsion in space from his millions of lives. He could just split off inner lives and throw them in the direction of his momentum to slow himself down and then eventually start propelling himself back to Earth. Schrodinger Alucard would just stop being in space and be on Earth again like it was nothing.</br>  MEoDP is the perfect counter to his immortality and given how much Alucard loves to give his opponents the first hit he's fucked.  <br><br>One Vampire killing vampire against another vampire killing vampire.</br></br>  Beat him in a fight? I can name several.<br>Kill him? No one comes to mind.</br>  Is there a character that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH Alucard? Let alone defeat him.  <br>Won't happen if he's frozen.</br>  <br> beat or even kill <br><br><br> beat <br> or even kill </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Space instantly freezing things is a retarded Hollywood myth. There is only sparse matter in space so the only way to lose heat is by radiation which for a non red hot body will take days if not weeks.</br>  <br>Yes, the Flash punched Accelerator and now his entire being is rippling from the Infinite Mass Punch, mere nanomoments away from evaporating into nothing.</br>  Joseph Joestar would rekt his vampire ass.  <br>Fight me IRL faggot</br>  <br>If you're referring to before absorbing Schrodinger or after? Because he is now everywhere and nowhere at the same time so it's impossible to kill him post absorbing Schrodinger.</br>  <br>In the book it Van Helsing, Harker, Quincy, and I forgot the doctors name.<br><br>Doctor stayed with Harkers wife.<br>Helsing killed the three vampire girls who hung around Dracula (They didn't have a name, but you can call them the Brides of Dracula)<br>Quincy (An American) and Harker tracked Dracula down, Quincy &amp; Harker first hurt him by stabbing him and then finished him off by cutting his head off and putting garlic in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  maybe Tohno Shiki, definitely Ryougi Shiki.  <br>Naruto could talk him into accepting death if he needed to.</br>  Yugi could just challenge him to a shadow game, then if he doesn't follow the rules of the game he'll die.<br><br>And I think Master Roshi could beat him, the fucker blew the moon and can catch bullets.</br></br>  <br>Guts could do it. That sword has counters Alucards strengths</br>  <br>Why wouldn't Tohno be able to?</br>  <br>I doubt he's that easy to talk into losing his own existence.</br>  <br>His greatest desire is to be beaten by a human, so it could happen.</br>  Any touhou character actually  <br>Those tiny dots on his glasses look like eyes</br>  <br>Maybe. But we know he will not go down without a fight.</br>  <br>Yukari maybe by manipulating his borders. I doubt any other Touhou can</br>  <br>Reimu Without Hakurei God Power&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>Shinki<br>Shinki = Destroying and recreating makai (infinite number of infinite size infinite dimensions) by her mere presence<br>Anyone above stage 2 &gt;&gt;&gt;reimu (without fantasy heaven)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reimu floats above reality so she's impossible to kill, then she also has bullshit sealing techniques that leave the enemy at her mercy.<br><br>Okuu can attack him with the power of a thousand suns<br>Seija can flip him to death<br>Sakuya just knifes him to death a dozen times<br>Suika can do something with the density bullshit<br>Remilia can rewrite fate<br>Satori can read the enemy's mind to instantly learn all of his attacks<br>Koishi can manipulate the subconscious<br>Flandre can destroy anything, period</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The flash :^)  <br> walks into the sword of a single man <br> can beat a man that summons hundreds of thousands of people with swords <br>He'd be more fucked than sideshow bob in a rake factory.</br></br></br>    <br>『That's a silly question.』</br>  <br>Plot induced stupidity and flash can destroy him before he can even react<br> IMP with the energy of a white dwarf (capable of doing billions in yoctoseconds) <br> Speed force dump <br> Speed Steal <br> Kinetic Energy Manipulation <br> phasing his brains out on quantum level <br> go back in time and kill him as a kid <br> alucard cant damage flash because speed force armor <br> Regen on par with alucard <br> can age alucard into dust <br>Flash stomps<br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alucard is faster where it counts.</br>  <br> Plot induced stupidity and flash can destroy him before he can even react <br>So why did he walk into a sword?<br>Not even like a normal person who would immediately realize their mistake, he saw the sword and continued to walk into it for what would've been seen as millions of years.</br></br></br>  <br>Causality</br>  <br>Pic related, the flash is a fucking retard.</br>  Off the top of my head<br> Bernkastel <br> Giorno Giovanna <br> Madoka <br> Homura <br>Also unsure about these but<br> D'arby twins <br> Kira yoshigakawa <br> Okuyasu <br> Buu (Using absorption) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if you had some super robot with infinite power that represented the abstract concept that evil always winned.<br><br>Christians: 1<br>Atheists: 0</br></br></br></br>  <br>Writers do REALLY Stupid shit sometimes (like red hulk punching the watcher)<br>The explanation in universe was that deathstroke fought so many times with flash he anticipated his moves with a keikaku<br>As I told you its PIS</br></br></br>  <br><br>Could Ryougi actually be able to kill him?<br>His whole deal - post Schroedinger - is that he is and isn't there.<br>As far as I can see it, he's a concept much fucked up than Wallachia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wins*</br>  <br>Literally poor-man's Alucard.</br>  <br>Alucard only dies when he stops recognizing his own existence.</br>  <br>Plot induced stupidity is stupidity none-the-less.</br>  <br><br>thats why I said maybe Tohno, but that "concept" deal is still fair game for Ryougi.</br></br>  <br>Wouldn't that be some kind of Evil Cosmic Armour Superman?<br><br> Thouugh CA Supes isn't as powerful as some people want to make him out to be - he couldn't even properly defeat the enemy he fought in the one comic he showed up in. </br></br></br>  <br> Writers do REALLY Stupid shit sometimes <br>Yeah like attoseconds, IMP, and most flash shit.</br></br>  <br>Would Rohan be able to beat him?<br>He can basically control people as long as they see his art.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if that's so.<br>She had a hard time with Araya. Something like Wallachia or Alucard would definitely be harder to kill.</br></br>  <br>Stalemate then even shit tier like cirno with spellcards rules on can tank explosions of multiple klein bottles (infinite mass) or use TP to make him stop believing in himself<br>Touhous are literally stupid power wise<br>(But I like the games)</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah flash is Bullshit level but he isnt even that strong in comic verse</br>    <br>So Koishi can do it. She can manipulate his subconscious to kill him.<br><br>The other characters can just render him incapable of fighting though.<br><br>Also wouldn't it be possible that if you're strong enough he'll just admit he's gonna die ? Like after getting knifed a dozen times he realises he can't beat any of the cast and just decides to die.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of them</br>  <br>Yes. Alucard. Alucard could kill Uchipapa Madmouiselle</br>  Lelouch Vi Brittania orders you... To die!

The watch order is the OP of the TV show right before playing any episode of Hellsing Ultimate.</br></br>  <br> wut? <br>Stopman can beat everyone from Umineko, including Featherine</br></br>  <br>he can stop time okay, it's still pretty useless if he can't actually kill them</br>  <br> TO PUNISH THOSE WHO CANNOT NORMALLY BE PUNISHED, <br>Except that she could be punished by going to jail.</br></br>  <br>What's the story about anyway? I heard its about Nazi vampires but then someone mentioned quantum states and other chuuni immortality shit ITT</br>  <br>Can't argue with that. Isn't Stopman strong enough to stop Demonbane?

He's basically made out of all the different memories of all the lives he's consumed. Penance Stare forces you to think about the shit you've done, but Alucard pretty much can't not do that.</br>  <br><br>How much better are Ryougi's?</br></br>  <br>Tohno shiki</br>  <br>thats not really how it works<br>overkill may be underrated, but the damage doesn't spill over into other lives like a bad glitch in a doom game</br></br>  <br>nerd.</br>  <br>That story is ever getting told, because there's no logical way it could have fucking happened.</br>  <br> Launch <br>;_;</br></br>    <br>Completely irrelevant and forgotten character</br>  <br>not without going into capeshit. so i'll pass.</br>  <br>The water in your lungs and body becomes frozen in about 90 seconds</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>what if integra was umaru, aru-chan geemu geemu</br>    <br>black dynamite would whoop that vampiric cracker ass</br>  <br>They won't cause her brain to fry like Tohno's can, and they have an easier time "killing" inanimate objects, even intangible things like concepts.</br>  <br>Well since you asked so nicely... But just once.</br>  <br>Nazi robots start world war 3 to kill Alucard.</br>  The guy he stole that costume from.  <br>Featherine would work too.

Plus his'll fry his brain maybe.</br></br>  <br>Spongebob. <br><br>There was one episode where this flounder starts hitting him and you learn that Spongebob is immune to damage. <br>Spongebob just has to sit there until Alucard either gets tired or forfeits.</br></br></br></br>  Takamura by KO in the 8th. The kid has oxygen in his muscles.  <br>boogedee boogedie booooo</br>  <br>He's not very fresh.</br>  <br>After Alucard killed off all the other souls except for his and schrodingers or are we just ignoring that?</br>  <br><br>Please post "that"</br></br>  <br>he gets punched by a fish, fuck that means im immune to damage because a fucking flounder cant hurt me with his fins. brb guys going to go stab a baby cub in from of her mother, she cant do shit anyways</br>  <br>yeah, remember when he almost dried to death as well? he only got saved by David Hasselhoff, if anything David Hasselhoff is the strongest being in spongebob universe</br>  <br>the control</br>  <br>Was it just me or did Alucard expect waaaay to much from Anderson/humans?<br><br>He begs Anderson to keep his humanity and fight him 1v1 but through the entire fight he hid behind numbers, literally brought a gun to a knife fight, and has been fighting a guy with enough regenerative capacity to make other lesser vampires envious.<br><br>He even got angry at that random Brazillian SWAT guy who shot himself. What the hell kind of response was he even expecting from people who've no idea that vampires exist, let alone one on his power level.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Easily be a highschool girl. <br>It's not even a question of power levels when your opponent can alter space and time.</br></br>  <br>When he dried in Shell City it was the combination of his tear with Patrick's that saved him, not Hasselhoff. Hasselhoff was just transport. You can not defeat Spongebob's Goofy Goober spirit.</br>  <br>Took me longer than it should have to get that.</br>  <br>I want ShindoL to break him up</br>  <br>Spongebob actually has a lot of ridiculous endurance feats.<br><br>- He survived being within a few feet of the explosion from an atomic bomb<br>- When torn he can reassemble himself easily<br>- Has incredible regeneration on par with Wolverine if not a little faster as seen multiple times in the show<br><br><br>- Even when he is dried out to the point of death he recovers instantly when he becomes moist again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>will i recover if i get moist?</br>  <br><br><br>Oh another thing I should mention is that as of the latest movie Spongebob no longer seems to have the weakness to becoming dry.<br><br>Spongebob at his strongest in canon essentially has no weaknesses anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quite literally the perfect counter.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> beat or even kill <br>Are you retarded anon?</br></br>    Aizen if he had kyouka suigetsu <br>or any uchiha with ms could convince him he doesn't exist</br>  <br>mango sauce?</br>  <br>He didn't try to kill her though. He could look up to the concept of her existance or something like that and cut it, but he merely dismembered her.</br>  <br><br>He couldn't. Ryougi struggles to even seen the lines on a guy who is 200 years old simply because he's 200 years old</br></br>  <br>That's Ryougi. Tohno killed Nrvnqsr with ease.</br>  <br><br>So? He's fucking weak</br></br>  <br>Uh, Arc said she'd have difficulty destroying Nero even before Shiki went and diced her up. I don't know what you consider 'weak' but 30% Arc is not it.</br>  <br>guess his just sick of existing and wants someone to put him out his misery. to bad its really hard to do it.</br>  <br>Demonbane.</br>  <br>nero is pretty weak. his just really really hard to kill.</br>  <br>motherfucking /thread</br>  <br>That's the same thing Alucard has post Schroe. Funny, considering that's why people brought up the MEoDP users eh?</br>  <br>Math.</br>  Stick.      Yakumo Yukari, most probably.  <br> Near infinite <br> Borderline omnipotent <br>You're retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Wonder if Alucard runs out of life first or Himegami runs out of blood first</br>  Depending on how Heartspan-the-cheat-sword would interact with Alucard's multiple lives, she might be able to either "kill" him once with a surprise attack (or several times, killing Alucard ain't all that hard actually, the problem is it being not enough) before Alu decides that that's enough and murderates her, or attacking him with the cheat sword can actually lead to complete elimination of him as a phenomenon. Also, as Kiss-Shot is a vampire too, she can potentially consume (non-resisting) Alucard and make him a part of herself, eliminating him that way.  <br>Stabbing Alucard is not enough to kill him. Part of him is in Mina Harker's body and if you don't destroy that he can just come back again and again. <br> implying Kiss Shot and Alucard wouldn't just fuck constantly </br></br>  <br>He's not her type.</br>  <br>But can he beat Superman?</br>  <br>Judging from the feats he's displayed he probably can't even beat Goku.</br>  He's immortal and unbeatable, therefore she can defeat and kill him.  <br>All you have to beat Nienami is spam ridiculously weak attacks</br>  <br>And not be known to be immortal, because absolutes like that can be therefor'd.</br>  <br>Maybe but that one irrelevant side character can one-shot vampires like him</br>  <br>Yes, Rohan can make anyone kill themselves instantly as long as they take a millisecond of a glimpse at his manga.</br>  <br>This. D is so much more then Alucard.</br>   implying any character could even hope to defeat Put Back   <br> DIO <br> Giorno <br> any Pillar Man <br> D <br> Akuma <br> Dante  <br> Vergil <br> Superman <br> Silver Surfer <br> Thanos <br> Dark Schneider <br> Pegasus Seiya <br> Dr Doom <br> Ghost Rider <br> Dr Strange <br> Darkseid <br> Odin <br> Thor <br> Hades <br>Want me to go on?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> any Pillar Man <br>They lost to a simple human rather easily, Ultimate Kars will kill him though.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't think there's a single person ITT who can actually stand a chance against him. None of the other vampire characters for sure.</br></br>      <br>I don't think it'd be hard to defeat him once, but everyone would probably be bored before they kill him 2 million times. Unless he fucks up and releases everyone, he should be fine.</br>  <br>Please. So wimpy he can't even handle an extra light dose of  the D .</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Alucard isn't shit, though. You just provoke him into unleashing his full power and then you AoE him down.</br>  This guy  <br>Yea. Most people have no idea how insanely powerful he is. I remember a thread D vs Alucard where a guy kept giving them new D feats, every one of his comments was different, while like 5 guys just regurgitated same bullshit at him (well D never met anyone like Alucard, it doesn't matter that he's stomped vampires and beings that make Alucard look like a bug, it doesn't matter that he has a million consistent feats of blocking regeneration far superior to Alucards own, Alucard is so powerful, he plays with his enemies, yada yada). It was literally 20 pages of that, it made me sick.</br>  <br> simple human <br>A hamon master with confirmed FTL reflexes, yes. Joseph wouldn't have any trouble with Alucard.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that just a fan theory?<br>Besides, there are characters that could instantly end him, like Dark Schneider.</br></br>  <br><br>His sword skills alone are parody level.<br><br>He doesn't even have any 'special ability' or special sword, it's just his skill level with a regular longsword is so high it can out-cut even the highest levels of Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. And i love it.<br>On pure skill, with a regular sword, he:<br>Regularly blocks insane healing factors<br>Cuts holograms so they can't reform<br>Cut a creature that shrugged off 3 consecutive nuclear blasts<br>Cut through literally indestructible metal<br><br>And other stuff like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget when he killed a creature that was literally "immune to physical damage" by cutting it.<br><br>His blocking of healing factors seems to stem from the fact that he can cut the very fount of life, even if you have infinite regenerative ability to reform from 'nothing' it seems you'd be in mortal danger getting cut by him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, like that godlike vampire lord with insant regen. D cut him and a med-bot informed him it'll take AT LEAST a year to heal.</br>  <br><br>He was probably going easy on him, usually if D is coming for you wounds will be mortal.</br></br>  <br>I think the guy was powerful enough to escape.</br>    <br><br> escaping D <br><br>Jesus Christ he must be some level. That reality-warping machine God that created a distance of infinity between him and D couldn't even get away. D sprinted that distance in 'seconds'.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alucard itself it's an anomaly that IB would shit on.</br>  <br><br>Eh, out of those I think only Koishi can beat him.<br><br>Overkilling Alucard hardly works, and Anderson did the same thing that you just said about Sakuya at the first time they met and he still survived.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alucard-Schro doesn't regen though. He observes his own existence and exists as long as he's observed in some way.</br>  <br>Giorno Giovanna with GER<br><br>What do I win</br></br></br>  <br><br>And then D cuts his existence.<br><br>This guy managed to cut a hologram and it couldn't reform itself. A fucking hologram. And it couldn't reform itself.<br><br><br>A HOLOGRAM</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. I said he was godlike. Although he may have sacrificed his men, and D may have let him escape. But yea, the point was that a cut (which D probably didn;t intend to be lethal) couldn't heal for a year.<br><br>Didn't he cut Death itself in the form of knights when some chick summoned it?</br></br></br>  <br>Alucard has the literal power of "nuh-uh, I'm fine your attack didn't damage me". With schroe any fight of his becomes a playschool argument where you have to convince him you beat him.</br>  <br>That's cute. D has the power of ''fuck you, i killed death itself with my swordplay and ran across infinity in seconds''.</br>  <br> Didn't he cut Death itself in the form of knights when some chick summoned it? <br><br>I think so, it was a great big cloud of "death" that killed any lifeform that it came in contact with I believe, and he killed it.<br><br><br><br>D has already gone up against people like that though.<br><br>"nuh-uh, I'm literally invulnerable to physical damage"<br><br>and then he cuts through them with a regular longsword.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it's an impasse of bullshittery where no-one wins? Hooray.</br>  <br><br>No, we're only comparing with D's sword skill right now. That's only really one aspect of attacking method and it's probably his weakest if you consider what he can do with his palm-mouth.<br><br>Didn't D also once break out of an alternate dimension that was separated from reality just by running in circles really fast? This guy is hilarious</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just went through the Vampire Hunter D wiki for a bit and D can apparently alter the Akashic Records. So he can just delete Alucard altogether.</br>  <br> D can apparently alter the Akashic Records <br><br>Fuckin D.</br></br></br>  <br>Hahaha. No. Don't kid yourself, someone like the Silver Surfer, who barely registers on the bottom of the cosmic food chain, would eat Alucard alive. Surfer is NOTHING compared to D.<br> n-nuh uh! muh shrodinger Alucard! Surfer can't touch him! <br>Norrin Radd was bestowed by Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds, with a minisule portion of Galactus' power cosmic. This power is the core of Surfer's abilities, and through it he can produce VIRTUALLY ANY effect he desires, including, but not limited to:<br>Fundamental Forces Control<br>Matter and Energy absorbtion and Manipulation<br>Massive Amplification of his already Superman-level physical stats <br>Cosmic Senses<br>Reality Warping<br>QUANTUM MANIPULATION<br>and many more.<br>This guy is NOTHING to D. Unless you have anything smart to say don't respond at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Beat the shit out of a pureblood son of Dracula who was hyped as fuck to be the strongest vampire ever <br> The guy uses the record to heal himself <br> D still wins </br></br></br>   D feels Sacred Ancestor, an omnipresent entity, watching him <br> closes his eyes <br> scurries about gathering this Sacred Ancestor into a big dirty mothball in his mind <br> visualizes himself stabbing this mothball in his mind <br> no omnipresent entity watching him anymore <br><br> this actually works <br><br><br>hwat</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> gets turned into water <br> able to retain his shape and sentience <br> gets turned into a sun <br> gets better in no time <br> caught a lazer that has literally instant speed </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This sounds like bad fanfiction to be honest. Is he Powerman?</br>  <br>The novels are top tier and D is an excellent character. It's really not so much about the struggle as it is about his travels, meeting fascinating characters and visiting incredible places. The world building is phenomenal.</br>  The D from D.Y.N Freaks is stronger<br>It made Azathoth shit itself and turn into a school girl to try (unsuccessfully) to hide.</br>  <br><br>I'm making it sound more terrible than it is<br><br>D is a terrifying opponent but if you think he's broken you should see his dad, good fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br> It made Azathoth shit itself  <br> It made the omnipotent being, who created all of reality through accident by dreaming, shit itself <br><br>Now see, there's a difference between an excellent story with a bit of over exaggerating, and a piece of shit with retarded powerwank.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I suppose I could read them<br><br>Holy shit</br></br></br>  <br><br>You picked the wrong thing to point out there.<br><br> turn into a school girl to try (unsuccessfully) to hide. <br><br> turn into a school girl <br> a school girl <br> school <br><br>Ah, gotta get back to the typical school setting shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  Why so many powerlevel threads as of lately?<br> Demonbane, Ashin'in-san, Featherine and Myuugi. </br>  <br> Bleach <br> Strong <br>Literally the weakest of the big 3</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, that was just an arm by the way.
