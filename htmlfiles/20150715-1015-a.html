[ Do people actually appreciate memes in their subs? Who are the translators doing this for?  <br> Who are the translators doing this for? <br>Their faggot selves. Stop downloading commie</br></br>  <br>Memes are love.<br><br>Memes are life.</br></br></br>  That was part of her character; she browsed 2chan and posted teh epic memes.  I'm all for hating Commie, but that show really was full of memes.  <br>She's spouting a 2ch meme there though.</br>  Too bad in the dub she said some shit about Leeroy Jenkins. You can't escape Eric Meems.  <br>The Japanese script said something like "this guy is hopeless", there was no memes there.</br>  Commie is the best fansub group around. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what he's talking about.  <br>It's a Death Note meme you fucking newfag.</br>  <br> downloading commie <br><br>Kill yourself faggot, twice</br></br></br>  bait thread dont reply    <br>It was a localization of the script since Kurisu indeed says 2chan memes.<br>If anything you should ask if it is okay to say memes in public.</br></br>  The main job of a translator is to transmit the essential point from one culture to another. If a character is spouting Japanese internet memes there's nothing wrong with translating that as western (English) memes. Not that I agree with everything Commie has done though.  Why is Kurisu such a memester?  <br> see a post I don't like <br> call it bait <br><br>So this is all commie haters can do.</br></br></br></br>   there are people on /a/ who need subs <br>There needs to be captchas in japanese on /a/.</br>  <br>Everyone was praising Commie for their Yahari releases though. I thought that was a good indication.</br>  Commie is love.    <br>I think memes should be untranslated tbh</br>  <br><br>They're just haters. Notice how people who hate commie don't know a lick of Japanese.</br></br>  <br>More of this</br>  <br><br>Okay, so when you're translating The Dark Knight Rises are you just going to leave "You're a big guy/For you" in English?</br></br>  <br>Why would internet memes be some sacred part of Japanese culture that should not be touched?</br>  They replaced japanese memes with western memes. It's fine.  <br>I don't watch meme shit movies gomen</br>    <br> some sacred part of Japanese culture <br><br>Because there's a lot of stuff that you SHOULD NOT translate and memes are one of them<br><br>Besides wouldn't you like to learn about Japanese memes? I would be fun</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't remember what subs I downloaded but they did have something similar to that. I did have memes though.</br>  <br>I wish we still had TLN in subs.</br>    <br> Because there's a lot of stuff that you SHOULD NOT translate and memes are one of them <br>I asked why.</br></br>  Lets have a thread without the dumb ops.<br><br>Who's your favorite non-harem girl?

But everyone is best girl.   Now watch the threads become so much more enjoyable while a certain someone is banned(?).    Why is this anime so perfect? Production, direction, soundtrack. Not a single complaint. How is that even possible, especially considering its Lerche.  <br>You guys might think i'm weird for this but...

I... I need to know  <br> blood <br>About that...</br></br>  <br>PAPI THE HARPY!</br>    <br><br>There was some guy who was spamming the thread crosslinking to various boards, saying only "NEW THREAD." There was also a guy screaming about "secondaries" and such. They also got deleted. So there's suspicion that they were all the same person.<br><br>It seems to be a 1 day ban, if this list is correct:<br><a href="https://www.4chan.org/bans" target="_blank">https://www.4chan.org/bans</a></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>suu likes all kinds of sizes</br>  <br>Hmm, since suu can change her size at will, its likley that her standards of size are different.</br>  <br>he was obviously trying to get people 'mad at secondaries' by spamming the anime everywhere</br>  <br>There's Monmusu Quest. Basically an RPG, but if you lose a battle, you get raped.</br>  You guys talk about Miia's belly all the time but what about Mero's belly? Her's is nice too until you reach the gills  <br> she can become smaller and tighter if your dong is small <br> she can become bigger to fit all of you in <br><br>Why is she so perfect?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not parpy the papi <br><br>Kek, this guy.</br></br></br>  <br>She knows nothing about sizes so she's probably wrong.<br><br><br>She's toxic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her gills are cute, don't bully Mero.</br>  <br>Mero's cute, but I just don't really like her character all that much. Hopefully the next chapter will fix that.</br>  <br> parpy the papi <br> not harpy the parpy <br><br>Get out of here kid</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mero's design is actually crazy cute. The issue being that Okayado is damn uninspired when it comes to have her character do shit.</br>  <br>I trust snake slut over slime slut. Snake slut would thoroughly know dicks while I don't imagine slime slut would. Good for Darling.</br>  <br>parappa the rapper</br>  <br>I have to say that the op song sucks. But the op animation is enjoyable.</br>    I want to fuck Papi raw.  <br>Am I the only one who absolutely adores the gills? Like ignoring the tail aspect, its my favorite monster thing about her. <br><br> You will never run your fingers over her gills from behind causing her to gasp in surprise as she turns back to kiss you. </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck.</br>    <br>Nigga that'd be like someone running their finger over your exposed lungs.<br><br> I'd do the same too it's probably ticklish. </br></br></br>  <br>That ED is amazing though</br>  <br>How many times?</br>  <br> Implying she wouldn't be the one fucking you raw first <br><br>Like you have the stamina to keep up.</br></br></br>  The lack of uncensored titties is making this anime terribly lackluster compared to the manga. The manga was echi as fuck, the mangaka is a former porn artist for christ's sake. Who the flying fuck thought toning down on the echi would make this shit sell better?  <br>Its shit.

Which do you choose?  <br>Buy the BDs if you want titties.<br><br>I appreciate the approach they're taken so far. With all the TLR:Ds and Shinmais and Prison Schools out there now, it's nice to see an anime that doesn't treat its TV audience like complete dogshit.</br></br></br>  So if they run out of monsters to give subspecies for, will they just loop back and list more subspecies for lamia, etc?  <br>Will the BD's even matter if character's are always standing in the way of the tits so they can't be uncensored anyway</br>  Tell me there is already highres wallpaper with pic related.  <br>Suu is saying the pool is too small.</br>  <br>With the pacing we're on, they'll never have a shortage of new species.</br>  <br>All three</br>  <br>Mero while wearing a rebreather.</br>  <br>Mero.

I mean, there's really only a couple of possibilities at this point. He either doesn't pick any and the series just ends, or some kind of harem end, which wouldn't make any sense considering how competitive they all are.    <br>It will be either harem end or Miia end</br>  <br>Do you have the video or gif of the crow solving that water weight puzzle to be able to reach his food?</br>  Cerea murdered a truck driver to catch a purse thief.  <br> miia and Darling get married <br> other girls move out <br> "look, Miia, Mero has to stay with us because she needs specialized accomadations and we're te only people who have them." <br> Miia buys it and treats Mero like a sister <br> Miia wan't a baby but things aren't going to good, and darling rarely wants sex <br> meanwhile Mero begins to get a noticable baby bump <br> Mero explains that "she found a guy" <br> Miia is happy for her <br> but wait, there's something wrong <br> Mero never leaves the house alone, and when she does leave the house, she does it with Miia and Darling <br> Than who could be the father <br> it turns out Darling is really in love with Mero and they've been NTRing Miia <br> every night Darling turns the thermostat way down to knock out Miia while she's sleeping <br> Miia catches on and turns the thermostat up one night <br> she pretends to fall asleep and eventually Darling leaves bed and goes to Mero's room <br> she follows and watches the crack in the door <br> Dear Sir is having hot, splashy, under-water sex with Mero <br> "Dahling, Dahling..."

In fact, there's not a single one I dislike. The worst thing I can say about any girl in the entire series is "they were adorable but their personality wasn't all that developed and I would have liked to see more of that."  <br>Pic related<br><br>honestly I think Miias mom is talking about whether or not he was impotent(which a lot of people wonder about harem MC's), then again as people have pointed out suu wouldnt really know dick sizes</br></br></br>  Lala is the best.<br>When will she get another arc where her dad visits as a chuuni grim reaper/headless horsemen.</br>  <br>I assumed she was like a doppler from the witcher 3 and had no true form to speak of</br>  <br>Somebody more clever than me come up with an Orochimaru pun for this picture.</br>  two chapters an episode<br>that means we'll end with Lala</br>  <br>Wouldnt it be better if her dad is the actuall incarnation of death?</br>  <br>you misspelled Rachnee</br>  <br> Orochimaru pun <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Her info page literally says there's a "crawling chaos" about her.</br>  <br>I feel the same.

Like she's dancing or bending over. This franchise delivered on the ass aspect pretty good so far, so why ignore the giantass?</br>   That ear wiggling in Centorea's short. <br><br>I know she does it in the manga but the anime has made her a real cutie pie.</br></br>  Sorry to interrupt, but here's a new color Hitomi!  I wish I could rape mero  <br>Who wouldn't? I want to breed with Raptors.</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I do have my favorites (Rachnee and Cathyl a best), but I just don't hate any of them.

Who's that?  <br>Her husbando loves her.</br>  Her mercs are selling like hot cakes, she´s super iconic for anime fans, she´s likable if you discount the latest movie.

The quiet grill with no emotions?</br>  <br>Her character is literally that she has no character, which works well within the context of the show, but outside of it it's just fucking boring.</br>   evangelion invented anime cliches   <br><br> Evangelion deconstructs entire mecha genre <br> only remembered because it flooded anime with <br> Blue haired 0-personality silent types <br> Red haired tsunderes <br> And incredibly generic looking pussy male MCs </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Blue haired 0-personality silent types <br>name another that fits this type<br><br> Red haired tsunderes <br>misty was from around the same time. is she the first asuka clone?<br><br> And incredibly generic looking pussy male MCs <br>there arent really that many that are as uselessly crippled like he is</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good trips<br><br><br>kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128075232 <br> that Evangelion has created </br>  <br>why not</br>  <br>Robin Williams did.

I never understood why she's supposedly the best girl ever. <br><br> Are you faggots not man enough for Misato? </br></br>  Fred Durst likes Rei  <br> wanting a degenerate like misato </br>  Best girl  <br>Because when I jerk off to her all I end up seeing is my mom.</br>  <br>nice dubs, shinji kun</br>  <br>Noice...<br><br>I bet he likes to get really fucked up nightly.</br></br></br>  I like her.  <br> I never understood why she's supposedly the best girl ever <br><br>That's because she isn't.</br></br></br>  I'd imagine that when you realise theres no best girl, you get your own CONGRATULATIONS scene.<br><br> I refuse to accept that Asuka isn't best grill. </br></br>  <br>But Shinji likes her.</br>  <br> not choosing homo route </br>  <br>Is NGE now a Mecha Bisexual Harem anime?</br>    <br>Rei is the best girl ever.<br><br>Some people think she isn't because for the past ten-15 years now, there hasn't been any good material out for her but plenty for other characters in the Evangelion franchise.<br><br>They don't know any better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At its core that's all it ever was.</br>  I like her and every single one of her clones.  <br> Good  end.</br>  <br>That's what the game says at least.</br>  So I just finished the anime (a bit late, I know).<br>Am I supposed to watch EoE to get it all ?</br>  <br>Yep</br>  <br>Yeah basically</br>  <br><br>You do know they don't end up together in that way, right? They hold hands in a platonic sibling manner if anything. To get the good route, Shinji has to confess his love to a certain person.</br></br>  <br>Well it's a little late now to go spend another 1h30 before going to sleep.<br>But does the movie manage to give a sense to ep 25/26 beside it being Shinji finally getting what was his problem ? Or does it only tie the loose ends ?</br></br>  <br>I never played the game, just like that picture.</br>  <br> tfw nobody to ride my baloney pony </br>  <br>I like the part where he thanks his parents.</br>  <br>It's okay anon sex is overrated anyway</br>  Best girl in their respective series thread.          <br>You have a severe case of good taste, OP</br>      <br> Iroha <br>No.</br></br>     seeeennnn paaaaaiii         <br>Disgusting.

They need a permanent one, like finding a way to kill him for good or just go with her plan (not the let's unite the world, that's just delusional) which is coexistence between kyouma and humans.<br><br>Sometimes you need to see the situation from another point of view. She's trying to save the world with another method than the one the heroes always used.<br/></br></br> </br></br></br>  I thought  Goldof  was the traitor. I\ll just keep reading until I hit a wall.  Later on you find that there's another seventh once the rabbitgirl is revealed to be the first seventh.<br><br>Adlet is actually the other seventh, but he's not evil. He just got brainwashed into being a whitefag for fremmy. Also fremmy is a ticking time bomb, if she's killed, then everybody around her is kill or something.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br> if she's killed, then everybody around her is kill or something. <br>That's what Adlet wants you to believe.</br></br>    <br>It's actually rokka.<br><br>Yes, they replace the word 'rokka' with 'brave'</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, this is not animesuki.</br>  <br>Is this legit? I really want to believe you.</br>  <br> ticking time bomb <br><br>Huh, it kind of does seem appropriate that if the saint of gunpowder were to die, she'd explode violently.<br><br>Though if that were true, then it gives me the feeling the series will end tragically with Fremmy sacrificing herself to blow up the majin after all seems lost.<br><br>And the only survivor will be Chamo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> coexistence between kyouma and humans <br><br>Gotta tell the Majin to stop invading the human world.</br></br></br>  <br>There's something off about her face.</br>  <br>She's not the heroine</br>  <br>Look back at vol1, his obsession to Fremy came out of nowhere and his first priority even when everyone was coming to kill him was still Fremy, he has one job.<br><br><br>It's not literal bomb, she'll absorb all the other crests that means annihilation in the middle of demon land. Honestly Fremy will be more happy if she died in vol5, I can't wait to see her face when she regrets it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Bunny literally sucks dog penises <br> &gt;Fremy gets raped by demons <br> All the girls in this series are sluts <br>Picked up</br></br></br></br>  <br> animesukifag <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>It was not really like an obsession, it all made sense because the heroes needed to be together, his last action against Mora was to protect one of the heroes before dying, he did something similar to gain Hans's trust.</br>  <br> Implying Adlet won't give her a happy ending. </br>  <br>So is this a Tales of adaptation?</br>  <br>She wants to use the demon's power to overthrow humanity because muh family is dead</br>   2 sets of ears <br>That's how you detect a fake.</br>  <br> “In the case that you are genuine then the first thing you should do is find proof that I am the seventh. However you aren’t. That alone is enough reason to suspect you.” <br><br> Adlet thought it was a strange theory, but he understood that from her standpoint it wasn’t illogical. <br><br> “That, uh…” Adlet searched for an answer. Various words came up in his mind, but none of them seemed suitable. He couldn’t aptly put his feelings into the right words. <br><br> He then recalled when he’d first encountered Fremy. It seemed like an extremely long time ago, but in reality it was just that morning. The feelings he’d felt then were the ones he desperately expressed in words now. <br><br> “I don’t want to think you are the enemy.” <br><br>He has been defending her ever since they met.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Durr LN's are shit hurr because they don't follow Western style writing. <br><br>Go fuck off to /lit/ if you don't like waifu and chuuni novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  “I wonder what Goldof-san is thinking about right now,” Dozzu said with a quiet voice. It was so soft that Nashetania was the only person who could hear him. <br><br>  “That’s right. He’s certainly troubled over whether to join our side or carry out the wishes of the Flowers. And more than anything he wants to see me again. That’s probably what he’s thinking.” <br><br>  "Is that so?” <br><br>  “It’s Goldof. There’s no reason I wouldn’t know that, right?” Nashetania said and then she smiled. <br><br>  “You were truly raised as a cruel girl. Do you even feel sorry about using Goldof-san?” <br><br>  "What are you saying? Goldof is definitely satisfied to be used by me.” <br><br>Bitch is the worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but his actions were logical, only his impulse was not. No need to consider everything as if it was because of Tgurneu.</br>  <br> only his impulse was not <br>Guess why</br></br>  <br>Didn't she conspire with Dozzu to kill her dad because he wouldn't play along with their plot. Or something along those lines.</br>  <br>bunny ears are part of her helmet.</br>  <br>I know why his impulse was not logical, but the rest was. His reveal was something logical, it was to protect another hero, and he did so for other heroes other than Fremy, protect your allies is natural.</br>  <br>She blames her dad for fucking things up</br>  <br>I can already tell that would just go swimmingly.</br>  <br> unironically using frontpage  <br> complains when he sees spoilers  <br>Xd xd xd kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br> Overthrow humanity <br>No that's not what she wants<br><br>And that's why you should not believe everything here, go back to animesuki.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Western style writing. <br><br>That's not the problem, you fucking moron. I read LN's myself, but don't pretend that they aren't shit. They are written in a incredibly simple manner, as they are made for teens.<br><br>They are literally a babys first novel in writing quality</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you read shit for teens?</br>  <br>Because that's the only thing Tgurneu did to him, the rest was all himself.</br>  <br>No, a babby's first would be goddamn comics and manga. Even if it has pretty pictures, it still counts as literature despite its low rung in the ladder. LN's are above that because it ain't all visual and you still have to use your imagination to imagine the details.</br>  <br>/lit/ likes quite a lot of japanese books, none of them LNs, and none of them books with "western style" writing.</br>  <br>That's what I wanted to say all along when I answered to , his actions were not unnatural, only his impulse was, he has always been himself.</br>  <br>Mora has a kid and a husband.</br>  <br>LN's are good for entertainment, and there are a few exceptions that are incredibly good</br>  <br>The husband is in the way. Time for some NTR.</br>  <br> not using the frontpage <br><br>Fuck you and your newfangled bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Good job proving half of his point.</br>  The guy behind Book of Bantorra wrote this.  Wait, wait so is this like FFIII where there are seven warriors of light and seven warriors of darkness and the bunny girl leads the warrior of darkness?  <br>FUK YOU OP SPOILING SHIT HOPE YOUR SISTER GETS HIT BY A TRUCK.</br>  <br>Any LN is written better than say... 50 Shades of Grey.</br>  <br>Almost anything is written better then porn for middle aged woman</br>  <br>I didn't know that. So anyone and everyone gonna die?</br>  <br>I learned something interesting today. I don't know how the LN are but the show had some good parts and a very interesting setting  and an absolutely awful end.  Also Bantorra wasn't shy about sexuality and other deviant stuff.</br>  <br>It didn't happen in Bantorra so why would it happen here?<br><br> HAMYUTS MESETA WO KOROSE </br></br></br>  <br>I thought a lot of characters died? Or is that just my shit memory being shit. I remember Noloty at least ;;</br>  I don't care what happens she's cute as fuck and I need more of her  What are the chances of her redemption? because I had her as best girl but best girl can't be a traitor  <br>oldfags are not people so it is no surprise.</br>  <br>It only gets worse and worse for Nashetania as time goes on.<br><br>Repent your sins now, and convert to Fremy, she who suffers to atone for all of us.</br></br></br>  <br>good lord that's sad. i think i'll make Adlet best girl and leave it at that</br>  <br>A lot. Not all.</br>  <br>Delete this</br>  Spoiler tags exist, so use them dipshits  <br>だが断る</br>  <br>  it only gets worse. <br>This is almost as bad as NTR</br></br>  I am nearing at the end of volume 1 and all I can say is, bunnyslut's plan is quite good but then again it failed so it's shit. <br><br> Can I still like bunnyslut? </br></br>  <br>You're a fucktard.</br>  Does this mean this series will turn out as shitty as Brave 10?  <br> Can I still like bunnyslut? <br>As long as it's for a traitorous nature and generous body.</br></br>    <br> she who suffers to atone for all of us <br>Fremy is too much suffering though, she doesn't have a single good thing in her life and even her 'revenge' is meaningless.</br></br>  <br>There are like, 3 plans in the whole series that went/are going according to the plan.</br>  <br>I really don't care about spoilers considering that the short preview for the show ruined everything already. We're two episodes in and the show still hasn't finished setting up the "premise" of the story.</br>   get completely spoiled <br> hope there's enough fake spoilers mixed in with the real so I can experience the TWEESTS genuinely <br><br>Either that or hope the execution is good enough the ride will be good, but PASSIONE.</br></br></br>  <br> he's going to be the cause of her biggest suffering <br> happy ending <br>You wish</br></br></br>  <br>Adlet is going to suffer more in that regard though if she goes and kills herself.</br>  <br>Is this really set in the Mayan/Aztec empire?</br>  <br>This shows are worse than NTR. You go in for a cute rabbit girl and end up with a whore slut.</br>  <br>You then stay for the cute dandere girl.</br>  <br>Why not enjoy rabbit as she is? All the characters in this shows were dicks to each other at some point.</br>  <br> Underestimating the World's strongest man <br>He will find a way anon.</br></br>  <br>No. It's fantasy.</br>  <br> spent 5 volumes telling how much he loves her <br> finally gets through he really genuinely cares and gets her to give up killing herself because everyone will die if she lives <br> he's actually mindcontrolled to love her <br>There is only one way out</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds genuinely stupid.</br>  <br>Fremy a qt<br><br>Anyone planned to translate the manga?<br>I really like the art.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone scanned the manga version?</br>   put spoilers in the OP <br>thanks newfags</br>  <br>You think like that because you are not the world's strongest.</br>  <br>They will get their happy ending, maybe they will kill one or two heroes but they will, I want Fremy to be the one who will kill Tgurneu.</br>  <br>No, but you can find the raw of some chapters from the comics section of the official website.<br><br>http://dash.shueisha.co.jp/rokka/</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like he would have hated her anon.</br>  <br>I wanna have little bunnies with her</br>  <br>No but she would hate him. Tgurneu orchestrated her whole family to love and betray her, then he trusts a guy and stops killing herself only to find out he's another pawn. I wouldn't be surprised if one day Tgurneu tells her the dog she loved so much was mixed into her breakfast.</br>  <br>Yes anon. I agree that tricksters are the best MCs. Tired of the generic swordsmen.</br>  <br>I want to fuck her like a rabbit.</br>  <br>He would have saved her so, she would have not really hated him, it's the same for her relationship with the other flowers.</br>  <br>I want to roast her</br>  So I recently finished volume 3 and am halfway through 4.<br><br>Goldoff is genuinely retarded. I thought you guys were insulting him but he's actually beyond fucked up in the head. <br><br>I once shipped Goldoff Nash because I'm a sucker for Knight/Princess pairings but this is not healthy at all. Poor guy needs to be saved from this curse.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I want to fuck her like a rabbit. <br>Are you me?</br></br>  <br>I feel you man. I hate these pricks who spoil things for others without a single care.<br><br>Luckily I didn't pick this up because it looks like shit so I don't care, but there are a few I would care about this season.</br></br></br>  <br>Now you're just being delusional.</br>  <br>Elaborate, it made perfect sense to protect her in volume 1 as long as he thought she was genuine.</br>  <br>What's there to elaborate? I'm not talking about Adlet, Fremy is literally living only because of him and what do you think would happen when she knows the truth?<br><br>Also in volume 5  he lied, took hostage again, created fales evidence, spread misinformation, team up with Kyoma, convinced Fremy, framed Hans as the seventh and made him run away with Chamo splitting the group. <br><br>All for her to live.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>I meant that he would have saved her regardless so she would have not hated him. This is not being delusional.</br>  <br>He won't go that far for others.</br>  <br>Showing the evidence that she is genuine before dying is not going too far in my opinion, other heroes did worse than this. He was just proving that she was genuine, nothing more. He's also the only one who stood up for Mora.</br>  <br>What? If you didn't read the spoiler part then stop posting. I'm talking about volume 5.</br>  <br>I get that, yes he's going too far in volume 5, and volume 5 only. So what he did in volume 1, which is the reason why she wished to live was not going too far, meaning that she would have not hated him.</br>  <br>No, everyone including herself wants her dead in volume 5. It was there she changed her mind after the clusterfuck from Adlet.</br>  Who turned out to be the second Seventh? Adlet or Fremy? Im confused by these spoilers.<br><br>And did Chamo and Hans seriously leave the group? These guys are truly fucked now.</br></br>  <br>Spoiler that shit man.</br>  <br>Makes more sense with that detail.</br>  To those that read the LNs, bets on who survives at the end?<br><br>At this point, I've somewhat written off Mora, as a mother who very dearly wishes to save her daughter, there's no way she's not going to sacrifice herself for something I feel.<br><br>I'm fairly sure Adlet and Fremy are doomed to bittersweet tragedy as well.<br><br>Goldof and Nashetania is a 50/50, either one or the other will die, but I doubt both.<br><br>Chamo and Hans are hard to determine, both have skirted death already.<br><br>Rolonia I get the feeling might be the only survivor at the end for pure suffering however.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same as you except I think Mora will survive. She missed her chance to die, though she still has her self destruct bomb.</br>  <br>Adlet will be the only one that dies at the end, calling it right now.</br>  <br>Fucking slut</br>  ORE WA ADLETO MAYER  <br>Nashetania and Chamo will die, maybe Mora too.</br>  <br><br><br> Too bad she's batshit crazy.</br></br></br>  Any moonrune reader can translate the story for volume 6?<br><br>〈運命〉の神殿で分裂した六花の勇者たちに、テグネウの本隊が迫っていた。<wbr>六花たちはアドレットを中心に作戦を練るが、限られた戦力で厳しい状況を打<wbr>破するため、リスクの高い作戦を取らざるを得ない。一方、テグネウは凶魔の<wbr>大軍による物量攻撃と共に、「愛」の力を利用した心理的な揺さぶりを仕掛け<wbr>てくる。絶対的不利の状況で死闘を繰り広げる六花たち。どこまでも自らの美<wbr>学に執着するテグネウ。そしてついに「七人目」のすべてが明らかになる！　<wbr>世界を救うことを誓い、復讐に命を懸けてきた少年に突きつけられた真実とは<wbr>！？伝説に挑み、謎と戦う、圧倒的ファンタジー、第６幕！</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>I want to offer her in sacrifice to the ancient gods</br>  Fucking sub-human scum  <br>What?, the slut rabbit is a traitor <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>She's been getting kyouma dickings all her life.</br>  <br>Basically the 6 heroes (probably excluding Chamo and Hans because they are doing their own thing) prepare an attack against Tgurneu with Adlet as the focus of the strategy (hah!). Meanwhile Tgurneu plans a psychological trap using the power of love.<br>Everything about the 7th becomes clear and the truth behind him, so probably his past, brainwashing and stuff.</br></br>  Waiting for best girl.  <br>I kinda hope Hans survives, with Chamo sacrificing herself fro him. The reverse works too, Hans dying developing the shit out of Chamo.<br>Nashetania will survive and will probably come out in a good position out of this mess.<br>Goldof I want to think he survives because him dying accomplishes nothing.<br>There's no way in hell Mora can die at this point.<br>Fremy is dying, for sure, but this will fuck over Tgurneu because she'll make a fucking great face when she dies and Adlet won't despair because of this.<br>Rolonia is the rebound girl and probably will become and important saint in the future</br></br></br></br></br></br>  There is one thing I want from the ending of this series.<br><br>And that is for the surviving heroes to document fucking everything that happened to them and what they learned, Jesus.<br><br>The entire 7th heroes fiasco, all the insane plans and all the Kyoma methods. All of it.<br><br>I'll be mad if it turns out whoever the remaining survivors are keeps stuff hushed up just to keep the dead heroes honored or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fremy needs her happy ending, her life has been nothing but suffering. Mora can die, she has no real role in the team now and her story with Sheniera is over. I think either Chamo or Hans will die too, Nashetania will prolly die with Dozzu.</br>  <br>That'd be my main grip with the ending.<br>At this point they think Adlet, Nashetania, Mora, Chamo, Goldof and Rolonia are the chosen heroes.<br><br>Also Tgurneu deserves getting humans to know how amazing he was and what he did to the saint of fate.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Fremy needs her happy ending, <br>Her happy ending implies killing Tgurneu before the black flower is activated and that Adlet actually loves her.<br>There's no way this is happening, I hope she meets her dog though.</br></br></br>  <br>Tgurneu plan is for Muh Majin.<br><br>The plan doesn't includes protecting himself from it.<br><br>Tgurneu is doomed to fuck up hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He knows the true nature of the majin, so my bet is on him planning to become the new majin, since whatever Nashe and Dozzu are trying to do implies replacing him.<br><br>I'm kinda rooting for him in some twisted way, his plan is so fucking good.</br></br></br>  <br>Who does Adler love?</br>  <br>Adlet knows the truth about the flower, what is he planning to do to protect her? A lot of things can happen.</br>  <br>The previous generation saints did something like that.<br><br>It was the saint of time the one who fucked up just because muh tanoshii.<br><br>Your lack of faith is disturbing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His plan is doomed because he thinks love can be used like a tool, sure it works but Mora proved that even his plans failed by the same methods he himself did use.</br>  <br> what is he planning to do to protect her? <br>Thinks he'll do to protect her:<br> kill his companions <br> stop giving a shit about the whole majin thing <br> let humanity be destroyed <br><br><br>Who knows? the guy has been brainwashed into loving Fremy to extremely dangerous degrees that have him unwillingly act like he was the 7th.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is that the heroes have no way of getting around it.<br>The only people who know the truth about Fremy are Adlet, who is purpousefully deceiving the heroes, and Hans, who is basically the likeliest candidate to be the 7th within the group, even though he isn't.<br>Mora was basically his test subject anyway, the Adlet-Fremy plan has been in the works since before she was even fucked into being.</br></br></br>  <br>Arent your 2nd and 3rd option is the same?</br>  <br>Tgurneu will not win, he will be the first to die.<br><br>It would stop the future explosion?</br></br></br>  <br>There are still 6 heroes, he can basically kidnap Fremy and chain her in a basement, yandere-way.</br>   All this brainwashing, betrayals and shipping keikakus <br>Does Cargikk even do something? From what I'm reading ITT the heroes are still being fucked hard by best boy or stabbing each other's back.</br>  <br> Tgurneu will not win, he will be the first to die. <br>I'll feel bad for him, the guy has put so much work and effort into winning, 200 years of trying and trying has to bear some fruuts.<br><br><br>Cargikk doesn't 'do' things, his strategy is incredibly solid as far as protecting the majin is concerned and that's it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Mora could find something to protect her family and who knows what Hans is planning, there, Tgurneu is doomed, maybe even in v6, there are still 2 other generals to kill and Dozzu is cooperating for now.</br>  How does swamp saint fight? From her power it sounds slow paced with her just regurgitating one at a time, but Sniper still loses to her. Can she just flood the board instantly whenever she wants?<br><br>She's supposed to have the strongest fighting power, but can anyone describe how its OP? Are her summons ridiculously strong?</br></br>  <br> and Dozzu is cooperating for now. <br>That guy is backstabbing them along with Nashetania the moment Tgurneu is out of the picture since they already have what they wanted since they found the saint of fate's not-corpse.</br></br>  <br>man, I still can not get over her fate in vol 4<br> <br> deny death <br> turn to corpse-like <br> bound to chair for years <br/></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br>That's something she wanted, she kept denying and denying and created a whole room just to be left alone.</br>  <br>As the Saint of the Swamp, I get the feeling what she vomits out is her swamp which encompasses all the controlled Kyoma/Jyoma she has.<br><br>Though really, her power's just hard to imagine actually seeing. It seems like the writer intentionally keeps how it works ill-defined just because it's really damn odd.</br></br></br>  <br>Also the landmarks in the kyoma territory<br> severed finger forest <br> dismay mountain <br> lost ear <br> punctured lung <br> broken leg <br> whatever else <br> fallen tears <br>I feel bad for her, she's, like, Fremy overdrive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you dont just fucking flag it man!</br>  <br>I see, I'm looking forward to how it's represented then.</br>  <br>Tgurneu doesn't even think she's human and straight up calls her a monster.</br>  <br>She's seen swallowing rabbits and spitting out their bones to get enough animal oils to protect her slug army from further white phosphorous attacks.</br>  <br>She's basically a tamer.</br>  <br> It would stop the future explosion? <br>I can see a deus ex machina coming from the dog.</br></br>  <br> implying the dog is not the trigger </br>  <br>WE WANT THE BANTORRA END</br>  <br>But I want them to make it back alive, maybe not Nashetania because she's a genocidal dog-fucker.</br>  <br>Nashetania would die too so nope</br>  <br>I thought you meant Fremy's dog.</br>  <br>Oh<br> Good evening Fremy, do you want to stop the black flower? <br> You have to kill your beloved dog <br> Haha fool you! that's the trigger! <br>I can't get enough of this guy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> your mother actually loved you and kept waiting for you all this time <br> only way to stop the dog trigger is to kill her! <br> just trolling </br></br></br>  Actually, if Tgurneu dies his power should disappear, right?  <br>Yes, all of it.<br>He'll make Fremy despair even after he dies and it'll be amazing.</br></br>  <br> Not sure if I follow <br>Wouldn't it solve everything?</br></br>  <br>It releases Fremy from the black flower and saves everyone.<br>It also makes Adlet's ingrained feelings of love for her disappear because they are incredibly abnormal.</br></br>  <br>Actually, wouldn't be that good?<br><br>I mean this time will be her turn to make Adlet fall for her.<br> tfw Fremy is full time tsundere if not perma-dere for Adlet. <br><br>Adlet did enough to earn that to say the least.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but before that<br> Tgurneu tells her that Adlet's feelings for her will disappear <br> Adlet's tells her it's impossible <br> his feelings start vanishing with time <br> he keeps pretending and pretending <br> one day she finally notices that Adlet doesn't love her <br> completely breaks <br>*cumming from the grave intensifies*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's incredibly out of her character.</br>  <br>Adlet has finally managed to make her accept he loves her for real, it could work given enough development.</br>  <br>Unless is feelings turn into hate, that's not a bad thing. Falling for her makes sense anyway, but the degree is abnormal.</br>  <br> Falling for her makes sense anyway <br>It really doesn't, I mean, he fell for her at first sight for no reason beyond I WANT TO PROTECT HER which is 100% Tgurneu's brainwashing.<br>Then they had some development but the whole basis for his feelings is brainwashing. Outside of that, he probably has more development with Rolonia, given their common past and what she did for him in volume 4.</br></br></br>  <br>And that was just Tgurneu's trolling, what kind of development can turn it around?</br>  <br>If Fremy falls for him for real, she can decide she wants to live together with him and finally step up her game and fight for her own happiness, which includes Adlet.</br>  Did Nash really fuck a dog?  <br>It only makes them good friends though, even Nashetania from volume 1 was closer to a love interest than Rolonia.</br>  <br>Third party.</br>  <br>Because Rolonia's incredibly low self-esteem fucks her over.<br>Nashetania blew her chances the moment she became evil and without the brainwashing, Fremy is basically on Rolonia's level.</br></br>  Thinking about all this Fremy suffering, I think I see the ultimate cumulation of all this.<br><br>At the very end of all this, with a dying Adlet in her arms, she will laugh. She will learn from Adlet and learn to laugh. In the face of all despair and lost hope, she will laugh and finally gain her resolve to live and be the strongest in Adlet's place.</br></br>  <br>Yes, she dons sexier black armor</br>  <br> killing Adlet <br>Poor guy, his life wasn't particularly nice either.<br>Then again, most heroes could die.</br></br></br>  <br> without the brainwashing, Fremy is basically on Rolonia's level. <br>I would not go that far after everything that happened, you are treating it as if it reseted their relationship, but everything that happened is real.

The OST is also great.</br></br>  <br>I still think it was the best version of the Golden Age so far, even better than the manga. Though it's a shame some things were missing, like Wyald.</br>  <br>I liked it but I preferred how it was portrayed in the manga because of some things missing from it</br>  <br>I really enjoyed it, thought it captured the mood and atmosphere of Berserk great. Really nice OST, some of the scenes/art were really well done, too.</br>  <br>The anime got me into the manga. I even made an... amv out of the anime.</br>  <br>Didn't Miura outright say that he liked Idolmaster and that the blue haired one was his favourite?</br>  <br>Which one? Maybe I've watched it.</br>  <br>Yeah, he compared Chihaya to Casca and said something about the two being stoic. Apparently we were supposed to know his favorite idol just from looking at Casca.</br>  Daily reminder that Miss Luca is best girl<br>Purefags can go fuck themselves</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ya2<wbr>5mRh-QRE</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Took me an hour.</br></br></br>  So how do you scrubs think Berserk will end?  <br>The anime captured the heart of Berserk moreso than the movies did I think. The TV series sacrificed some things in order to focus more on Guts and the band of the hawk in general as characters, and show how their relationship develops with one another. The Movies trim this out in order to include Skull Knight and some other things that the TV series omitted (though they still omitted a good deal of thins that the TV series had, which was weird.)<br><br>The TV series seems really low budget though, even for its time. The animation was off a lot of time and while the OST is fantastic, there's only like 6 tracks to it. Though the happy side effect of this was that the show has a lot of quiet time which greatly helped the atmosphere.<br><br>Also, the dub wasn't too bad either. Griffith is fantastic and the proof of it is here: https://<span>youtu.be/bXYiFFM7WH4?t=66  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of the JRPG party will die, Casca will be cured but will have no relocation of Guts or the Band of the Hawk.</br>  <br>Final scene is Rickert putting the Dragonslayer and Griffith's sword into the sword graveyard.</br>  <br> Casca commits sudoku after getting her memories back <br> Team Guts heads out from Elf Island after they get a powerup <br> It's been a thousand years, just like with the red eyed kid, time goes faster when with the elves <br> The Age of Darkness that's been said to be coming is in full swing <br> God Hand are ruling the Earth and are actually in their weakest since they're not weaving causality from their magic dimension <br> Skull Knight is kill, the God Hand are fighting each other for absolute dominion over humanity <br> One of Rickert's descendants is leading the rebellion for humanity <br> Guts joins them, things don't work out and people are kill <br> Guts despairs and awakens the Behelit <br> Since there are no God Hand in the weird dimension Guts has a one on one with the Idea of Evil <br> Literally kills God <br> all the apostle and God Hand revert to their human form <br> Guts doesn't kill any of them <br> the cycle starts anew </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not too bad anon</br>  <br> anon <br>You're replying to tane<br>And it's just the ED played over a chunk of the first episode.

You are?<br><br><br>The inevitable death of our tragic hero Guts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh i guess it's that forced anonymous thing on my end</br>  <br>Sure. There are people that don't? I actually like still shots for massive battles compared to the movies' awful CG battles.</br>  <br>I don't know, but there's no good ending in store for Guts.</br>  <br>This was pretty bad honestly, it seemed like you had no real idea of what footage to use so you just slapped a song over a scene from the Black Swordsman Episode. There seems to be no editing involved, it's just really lazy.<br><br>Here's an example of a good berserk AMV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9Lb<wbr>erS62RF4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>tl;dr it's shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Movies <br><br>Automatically shit. Mine is far superior in every way.</br></br></br>   mfw I won't wait one day for the chapter and there are people who waited years or even died waiting for it   <br><br> this newfag attwhoring this much </br></br>  <br>Why are all you tripfags and no names complete psychos?</br>  <br>Wait so you just got into berserk? <br>What is the appeal for an adult? I mean most people here started it as a teenager and just want to finish it now or have some nostalgia for it. <br>Why would anyone who isn't 14 years old get something out of berserk?</br></br></br>  <br> newfag <br><br>Get a load of this newfag.<br><br><br>What? Is it because mine is superior in every which way? Maybe you're the one who is insane...?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he is 14?</br>  <br>Most people here are 14 year olds or beaners who only care about Guts getting his revenge or the rape, not realizing that Guts has been prioritizing Casca ever since Conviction and nothing sexual outside of nudity has been shown for the best part of ten or eleven years. There isn't even that much rape, if you tally it all up.<br><br><br>Because we don't share your opinion, we are automatically insane. Good fucking going.</br></br></br></br>  <br>mfw I still haven't read Berserk yet and everyone says its the greatest thing ever made.<br><br>Procrastinating sure sucks</br></br></br>  <br>I discovered Berserk as an adult and love it, but then I always felt I never really mentally changed since I was 14yo, so maybe you have a point.</br>  <br>Not him, but I like how Guts has grown as a character, the atmosphere in berserk is very enjoyable and there are times where the writing really shines. Plus Miura artwork is very enjoyable to look at.</br>  <br>Just read it. You won't be disappointed, trust me.<br><br><br>Why are you typing like that, hmm? Getting a little defensive? Hah. I'm far from insane!</br></br></br></br>  <br>that is kinda my point. <br>Revenge is something teenagers find cool. But since miura took so long we all grew out of berserk.</br></br>  <br>Its an acquired taste you really can only get if you read it as a teenager. <br>Kinda like Dragon Ball Z in that way.</br></br>   Miura came back because he is scared he would Iwata before finishing Berserk   <br> Revenge is something teenagers find cool <br>That's like saying anime is only for autistic virgin otaku who jerk off to fan service.</br></br>  <br>It's hardly the greatest thing ever written, the early chapters are really rocky and there are a lot of moments where Miura drops the ball. It's not the FLAWLESS MASTERPIECE that a lot of people say it is, but with that said it's very enjoyable and has a lot going for it.<br><br><br>The tone of the manga is totally different from when we read it as teenagers though. It's about healing now rather than revenge. Not to mention Guts is happier than he has been in years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why have revenge when you can have a waifu?</br>  <br>So correct then?</br>  <br>No, he's obviously wrong.</br>  <br>Nobody else shares your "you grow out of it as a teenager", stop pushing it as fact. I don't think many teenagers would be able to stand the golden age arc considering how character focused it is. Also Berserk hasn't been about guts RAGING FOR REVENGE for a long time, it's all about trying to protect and save Casca.</br>  <br>Then it would be fine if there were no fight scenes anymore? Because the fucking title sort of implies it is about losing your shit which since day fucking one has been motivated by revenge.</br>  <br>No, the way you described anime fans is right</br>  <br>It's pretty good but barely having any animation somewhat kills it for me. It's basically just a coloring of the manga at worst.<br><br><br>Big army war.<br>Guts kills Griffith.<br>Falconia goes to ruin, pillaged and rapes everywhere.<br>Cutting the big Tree of Life turns everything back to normal.<br> Then Guts is told that he will have to wait 1000 years to finally kill Griffith for his revenge to be complete. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So would you actually recommend Dragon Ball Z to another adult without any disclaimer?</br>  <br>The three apostles are in the same thread now. No turning back.</br>  <br>I think throwing away all that Miura has built up for over the years in favor of some edgy Coldsteel-tier ending is very dumb. Guts should have a chance to make up for what he's done wrong in the past, and right now, I don't think he has the energy to follow any fleeting desires for revenge anymore.<br><br><br>Casca is technically also in a perpetual state of being berserk, as the definition also refers to someone who is emotionally hysterical. So even if Guts isn't it rageboner mode, Casca more than makes up for that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Guts kills Griffith. <br> Then Guts is told that he will have to wait 1000 years to finally kill Griffith </br></br>  <br> Guts kills Griffith <br> then Guts is told that he will have to wait 1000 years to finally kill Griffith for his revenge to be complete </br></br>  <br>It is a sign that Berserk is truly returning.<br><br><br>Yep.<br>Just like Skull Knight killed Void 1000 years ago.<br><br><br>If I keep saying it, when it'll happen, I will be seen as a prophet who saw it coming.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said that, I just mentioned that Berserk has more to it than just rage and fights. Some of my favourite parts of the Golden Age (and the series as a whole in general) were just scenes with the characters exchanging dialogue with one another. I like character moments like that.<br><br><br>No, Dragon Ball Z doesn't have the depth that Berserk has.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and I'll be seen as a prophet when Casca turns out to be the messiah.</br>  <br>We've been over that, she's not going to be a messiah because there's nothing for her to be worshiped as.<br> However, she's going to lead the old Band of the Hawk against the new Band of the Hawk. </br></br>  <br> she's going to lead the old Band of the Hawk against the new Band of the Hawk <br>No, when they arrive at Elf Island, the Elf king will tell the party that there is nothing wrong with Casca, she was pretending to be retarded because she enjoyed the rape, and doesn't want Guts to find out or to touch her</br></br>  <br> I don't think he has the energy to follow any fleeting desires for revenge anymore. <br>So what fuels his anger during fights? I mean I know he now fights more to protect his friends but his inner beast is still all about ripping Griffith apart. <br>If all you guys are right about guts having grown up and stopped caring about Griffith then he really needs to throw the berserker armor away and adopt a less aggressive fighting style<br>And the sword has too go to in favor of a shield to actually reflect how he is now fighting to protect people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>OH COURSE!<br>Casca simply needed to be fucked, to be out-raped. Reverse rape, even!<br><br>Brilliant.</br></br></br></br>  <br> So what fuels his anger during fights? <br>Nothing. He doesn't even seem angry anymore when fighting.</br></br>  <br> We've been over that, she's not going to be a messiah because there's nothing for her to be worshiped as <br><br>The black witch will save us all.<br><br><br>Bitches be trolling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The black witch will save us all. <br>You mean Farnese? Yes, she will save everyone by burning everything to the ground.<br>That'll be hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>What do you think does more damage to her? Griffith's demon dick, or Guts' bitch slayer cock? Berserker armor on for dick improvements</br>  <br>Do people really not count his inner beast as part of his psyche/soul? <br>I've never seen it as a different character but I guess if you ignore the beast then guts is actually pretty calm now.</br></br>  <br>Griffith's dick by far. It automatically mind breaks whomever he fucks. At first, you think it's just Casca who got mind broken because of all the trauma of her former commander raping her in front of her lover, but it's just another perk of becoming a God Hand.<br><br>I keep imagining Griffith mind breaking Charlotte and then continually wanting more girls to fuck. So he just gets young virgins every night to sleep with and mind breaks them up to the next morning until he is satisfied.<br>Then he orders a new virgin girl for the next night and repeats that process.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Farnese <br> black witch <br><br><br>Yes, and then Scheherazade fucks that up by telling him 1001 stories, the only difference being she tells the stories before he has the opportunity to copulate with her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then what hope does Guts have to defeat Griffith when his cock is inferior?</br>  <br>Even if you count it, he's much less angry than before.<br><br> Griffith's dick by far. It automatically mind breaks whomever he fucks. <br>That's just your theory. It hasn't been proven yet. I don't think that it's true at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Platinum would do better with KlK. Fromsoft should make the Berserk game.</br>  <br>Yeah but in the 1001 stories, the girl telling the story, somehow, got fucked enough times to give birth two times and be pregnant a third time.<br><br><br>Well, obviously, the DragonSlayer is there to compensate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None. <br>That is why SK calls him the struggler. <br>Now what kind of imagine does the word struggler conjure in your mind?<br>Its essentially his word for cuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence me saying "the only difference". For all your big talk, you have poor ability in reading comprehension.<br><br><br>Is this all what anons have gleaned from the series? That it's all one big NTR tale?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The TV series was very low budget, but it was very well put together.</br>  <br>The manga cannot be topped but the anime is excellent on its own. I just wish it had continued past the fucking Golden Age.</br>  I think Slan will die protecting Guts  <br>Casca clearly enjoyed the rape, so he is already cucked.</br>  <br>The eclipse is fucking godlike.<br>It's much more out of nowhere than in the manga where you kind of warmed up to things going nuts with the doggy apostle and all that.</br></br>  <br> That's just your theory. It hasn't been proven yet. I don't think that it's true at all. <br>True. It's not proven but something makes me think it'll happen. Something 'shocking' to show that Griffith is still evil and never cared for Charlotte after becoming a demon. The tipping point where we see how awesome Falconia is, showing how great the marriage and crowning is, and then we see the dark side.<br><br>It also makes sense in terms of duality since Casca will have her mind fixed/restored while Charlotte will have her mind broken.<br>Whether or not Griffith's demon cock mind breaks people is true or not, I still think it will make Charlotte mind broken after their consummation. <br><br>I personally just want to see Charlotte, mind broken, just not doing anything at all next to Griffith. With her becoming a literally figurehead who says and does nothing. That would be hilarious.<br><br><br> Hence me saying "the only difference" <br>I'm saying that telling the stories won't be enough to stop Griffith from mind fucking her.<br><br><br>Hahahahahaha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> am I fitting in yet </br>  <br>what are you saying? Berserk is definitely good regardless your age.</br>  <br>Well the one scene everything revolves around is about a guy watching the women he loves get pleasured and forget him while he furiously works on one of his extremities. So yes. It is all one big NTR-tale</br>  <br>Pls this<br><br>Griffith and whoever can think they are more important but everyone ends as just a dead solider of the hawk</br></br></br>  <br>The hell is wrong with you, I discovered Berserk last year when I was 20, and a whole new respect for manga opened up for me. <br><br>To think there´s people that are so full of themselves that actually believes everyone share the same belief as himself. Just get out.</br></br></br>  <br> this mad because someone hurt his escapism and triggered his autism  <br><br>There's a special place for you in MAL so you won't be hurted.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you on some fucked up crusade to enforce your shitty opinions? You can "get it" no matter your age, as long as you got a mature brain on your head. Damn lad, did you get beat up as a kid or what?</br>  <br>Why do you want bad things to happen to Charlotte so much? And what the fuck, how could you think that her getting mindbroken would be "hilarious"? I could understand if you wanted it to happen because you think it'd be interesting, but saying that it would be funny is pretty disturbing.</br>  <br>I actually agree with Hawk here, sometimes I wonder how people as disturbing as no name can live free of the asylum.</br>  <br><br>So you don't read Berserk.<br><br>Are you that autistic thinking that anyone is gonna care if you never read it?<br><br>Fucking autists wanting attention</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, there was that troll rape way back, but besides that it's been pretty vanilla.</br></br>  <br> Recommend MAL at all to anybody <br><br>Thank you for proving my point. As said, mature working mind. Not everyone has it, is okay.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not calling you stupid you are just a manchild<br><br> You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development. </br></br></br>  <br>Because a mind broken person satisfies me. I can just imagine Charlotte mind broken, fucking Griffith with a blank attitude, with Griffith also fucking her back without any emotion, just using her to satisfy his urges.<br><br>I find it hilarious because Charlotte obviously wants to have sex with Griffith again and it's the worst thing she can do, if my theory that it's his cock that mind broke Casca.<br><br>To see Charlotte's face as Griffith perpetrates her, turning into his Femto form, destroying her as he did with Casca, that, to me, is hilarious. Don't you want to see that? I have my hopes that Miura won't disappoint me and will make this happen.<br>And it's going to happen soon as well. After Griffith gets crowned king, there will be a marriage and a consummation of the marriage.<br><br>Don't you find it funny?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Good thing he's not talking about DBZ, he's talking about Berserk.</br></br>  <br>So why are you still here on the anime board?<br>What more sophisticated shows do you appreciate?</br></br>   We can just set the tripfags on each other  <br>Why didn't I think of this sooner?</br>  <br>I don't see what Griffith has to gain with mind raping Charlotte</br>  <br>this tbh</br>  <br>SK.net shows that the chapter where Skully reveals that Casca can be cured came out in 2004, so the troll rape would be at the most two years before that. Thirteen years of no rape or sex is a long, long time.<br><br><br>No. I think Griffith doesn't have any particular sexual urges, as he primarily uses sex as a means to power. Hopefully Miura won't do this, so we can see how disappointed you get.</br></br></br></br>  This is the worst Berserk thread ever.  <br>I thought it was really cheesy to use a quote that famous but I guess you actually are underage if you can't figure out what I enjoy by reading that spoiler.</br>  <br>Charlotte is one of the nicest and most faithful persons in the Berserk universe, and she definitely doesn't deserve to have terrible things like that happen to her. It's not funny at all, it's horrifying. And even as a god hand, so far Griffith hasn't done anything bad to his followers, and I don't really see this changing, especially not for Charlotte.</br>  <br>Every Berserk thread is the worst Berserk thread ever.</br>  <br>Nope, i don't recognize what anime that's from. Guess you have a difficulty reading.<br>:^)</br></br>  I hope David Production will make Berserk anime after JoJo adaptations in 2027  <br> JoJo fags </br>  <br>We had a good few threads just when its return was announced. Berserk threads are only good when Hawk, no name and tane aren't involved. I gotta stay up to 4am for that to happen.</br>  <br>she also by far the most naive character and the one character who has no fucking idea what is going on.<br>She is almost infuriatingly stupid. Like a character in slapstick comedy who doesn't notice what is going on in the background.<br><br>It would be nice to see her shocked into a interesting character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>welcome to /v/</br>  <br>She's worthless to him once he becomes married. Plus he's not going to do it on purpose, it's the curse of having a demon cock.<br><br>Before losing everything, Griffith used other people but still cared for them.<br>After becoming a God hand member, he used people but no longer cares for them. The same can be applied with Charlotte. She will be his way to become king, as was the original plan, but afterwards, what use does she have for him?<br><br>I only see sex and nothing else. If nothing, Charlotte will be by his side, mind broken, doing nothing. And that, to me, is hilarious. A literal figurehead without a head, hahaha.<br><br><br> I think Griffith doesn't have any particular sexual urges, as he primarily uses sex as a means to power. Hopefully Miura won't do this, so we can see how disappointed you get. <br>Perhaps not fucking Charlotte but you can damn well bet he's going to mind break her during the consummation of the marriage.<br>The latest chapters keep mentioning the crowing and the marriage being organised behind the scenes.<br><br>It could be true that Griffith has no sexual urges, though I find that hard to believe considering the other Apostle's sexual drive are on overdrive and they love to rape, but if sex is used as a means of power, disempowering Charlotte's consciousness through sex is something Griffith could easily do with his demon cock.<br><br><br> Charlotte is one of the nicest and most faithful persons in the Berserk universe <br>That's what makes it so hilarious. She's just a dumb girl who happens to be a princess.<br>And she doesn't fucking deserve it. But she'll get it once Griffith fucks her raw again.<br><br> Griffith hasn't done anything bad to his followers <br>Oh, but that's only because they have their usage.<br>Tell me Hawk, what use does Charlotte have for Griffith once he becomes king?<br>She has none. But, of course, Griffith can't simply get rid of a queen. Mind breaking her is the obvious solution.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's easy to say that from the perspective of the reader, because you know everything that happened, but it's not the case for Charlotte. She knew Griffith as a human, then he left, then she got confined to that tower. Eventually Griffith came back and rescued her, and saved everyone from Ganishka. Can you really blame her for not knowing everything that we know?<br><br>Even assuming she would have no use, which isn't necessarily true, that doesn't mean that he would want to automatically discard her. So far, he hasn't shown any sign that he'd do that.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be nice to see her shocked into a character with no personality or character, hahaha.<br><br>Just imagine Charlotte, on the thrown room, just acting like Casca going all ''oooooohh, aaaaa'' doing stupid shit.</br></br></br>  <br>But she won't be interesting if no name gets what he wants. She'll just be another Casca. Maybe if Charlotte becomes curious about why Rickert slapped him and delves a little deeper.<br><br><br>How stupid are you? She has use as the mother of his child. Even if the final member of the God Hand is immortal, every man who wishes for royal power makes it their top priority to produce an heir. That was Ganishka's entire motive for taking Charlotte hostage in the first place.<br><br>Plus tea parties.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WoW!1! YoU lIkE ThE SuN AlsO R1SeS 2!!!!???<br><br>U r So PaTriCtiAn!1!!<br><br>FuCK AniME!111<br><br>ThEsE PeOPle ArE aLL "A LoSt GenERaTION" <br><br>HAha AmIRitE?11?/!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judging by every scene of her and griffith she really should at least be a little bit curious. <br>She is probably not even going to investigate at all even after seeing that slap.</br></br>  <br> Falconia falls into disrepair due to mismanagement. <br> Gutts, who is pretty old by now, attacks Falconia <br> Manages to cut his way to Griffith, who hasn't aged a day. <br> EPIC BATTLE OF ULTIMATE DESTINY <br> Draw, both die from their wounds <br> Femto lives on as a God Hand member <br> Gutts ascends into legend. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It took you fucking twenty minutes to google it. <br>What the fuck is wrong with you. <br>I just wrote the first sentence and then it reminded me of that quote. <br><br>Oh and your posts really proves how adult berserk fans are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're still on the anime board.</br>  <br>fuck off tbh</br>  <br> But she won't be interesting if no name gets what he wants <br>I just chose to ignore his demon cock fanfiction part of his posts as I really thought it wasn't worth addressing.</br></br>  <br> we all grew out of berserk <br> we <br><br>Talk for yourself, i can still have fun and berserk still gives me goosebumps</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is actually a fact and you managed to type it without ironic bad grammar. <br>So you are getting better, that is good.<br><br>But I'm not sure what you are trying to tell me here. <br>There is no medium that is inherently immature.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, how naive of you Hawk No no no. She needs to stay, make a good image of a lovely bride to Griffith. Be a good queen and figurehead, like all women.<br>You see, Griffith can''t discard her, but he can make her irrelevant because only her body is important. It is the king that is in charge, the queen is simply around to be fucked and give children and nothing more. Griffith has no reason to produce offsprings for he is eternal and a demon.<br><br><br> mother of his child <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.<br><br>Are you serious?<br>Why would Griffith even care to have a child? However, Charlotte would make a fine concubine. A girl whom Griffith could fuck and mind break every night for his own purposes.<br><br>It would also be hilarious for the queen to wander the streets, mind broken like Casca, naked, just walking around aimlessly.<br><br> produce an heir <br>No, producing a heir is only useful to unite kingdoms.<br>The Emperor proposed that to get a foothold in Midland. Nothing more.<br><br>Griffith has no use in having an heir. His goal is to have his own kingdom, not a legacy.<br><br> tea parties <br>Griffith does not require food or tea.<br><br> Anyways, I must leave for a party. I shall return in a few hours. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Griffith needs a baby Griffith for when Guts kills him</br>  <br>Yeah, sure. You're still dancing around my previous question.<br>What anime or manga appeals more to a mature mind individual such as yourself? I'm trying my best here and i know it's hard to understand what i'm saying with my tiny baby brain.</br></br>   You're at the Ball <br> suddenly this wise man slaps your mercenary fucboi ass <br><br>What do you do?</br></br></br>  <br>No, Griffith will sacrifice Falconia, using the behelit Guts has (somehow) to go back to the Astral.</br>  <br>Berserk armor?</br>  <br>Rape Casca.</br>  <br> No, producing a heir is only useful to unite kingdoms. <br>That's not even true. Historically, heirs were used for many things. Primarily to make sure the dynasty would keep ruling over realms, and then for other more minor things, like diplomacy, administration, and military service.<br><br>Not saying Griffith will necessarily make a heir, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What do you do? <br> "I"m a girl!" </br></br>  <br>And then Guts is going to kill Griffith</br>  <br>Berserk appeals to me because of nostalgia. Its something I liked as a teenager and still like because it takes me back. <br>You can like something immature or stupid without being immature or stupid as long as you are aware what it is and don't live in denial. <br><br>But I know you will sperg out like a massive retard if I don't give you a concrete example since you actually think I don't have an answer. <br>So I give you something that unlike berserk I wouldn't have to put a disclaimer on if I would recommend it to adults. <br>Paprika<br>Anything Satoshi Kon is probably a good idea really. E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill my father.</br>   So I give you something that unlike berserk I wouldn't have to put a disclaimer on if I would recommend it to adults.  <br>Uh, no actually you'd have to admit that you're an adult watching fucking cartoons.</br>  <br>Of course, I didn't mean that they were used solely for that reason but for the Emperor's goals, it was to simply unite his with Midland so that he could conquer the rest of the kingdoms.<br><br>Producing a heir was still good for maintaining order, lending them to other kingdoms as hostages, promises, good relationships, etc.<br><br>In regards to Griffith, he has no use for any of that since he sits in the only safe spot in the world.<br><br>Come on Hawk, agree with me. Don't you think it would be hilarious to see Charlotte mind broken? You know she has no use for Griffith.<br>You only see yourself in her because she was the love of Griffith pre-Eclipse, when you loved him. <br>She doesn't need to die, simply become entirely mind broken and useless, bare naked and stained.<br><br>Don't you want that? <br>As Guts fucks passionately Casca with love, Griffith fucks Charlotte out of obligation and mind breaks her.<br>It'll be hilarious, just you watch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah seriously. The three of them together at the same time? This is truly a scary era to witness Berserk threads. Can't wait for them to shit up every single thread about the upcoming chapter s <br><br> I still can't believe it will go monthly </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128079320 <br> He asked what more sophisticated "shows" you appreciate and you responded with a quote from a novel. <br>I gave you one example now. <br>I'm bracing for you and him to quote it and then put<br> implying it is good  <br>below it. <br><br>I really don't see how any example could help you understand my point if you can't even grasp the argument on a conceptual level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread really died abruptly for no reason.  <br>is there any indication we're even nearing the endgame</br>   literal retards still suck the dicks of literally retarded random irrelevant shitposters <br> morons who think they're funny and try to fit in still shitpost in a Berserk thread <br>What a surprise. Donovan is irrelevant, you morons.</br></br>  <br>No chapters for 666 years.

I guess acting like a true autistic individual would be acceptable if said individual at least had an above average taste. But you couldn´t even match that one criteria. <br><br>Did you actually watch Paprika? Satoshi himself said in one of his interview that he was unsatisfied with the final product, the romance was not given enough screentime, which hindered that little extra emotional push Paprika really needed to make the audience get Megumi´s motivation.<br><br>Lesson of the day? Don´t can act like a little child, if you must though, at least have decent taste. You might as well have written To love-ru.<br><br>Pinky swear to me that you at least appreciate your mother for not dropping you too many times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GeYY<wbr>sQ_U65M</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Interviewer queries Miura on the purpose of purchasing of a premium account on Nico Nico Douga <br><br> Miura responds with iDOLM@STER, among other things <br><br> Toshiyuki Kubooka(guy with gendo sunglasses and original iDOLM@STER character designer) can be seen quite uncomfortable after that response. Incidentally, he is also the director for the new Berserk movie <br><br> Interviewer asks Toshiyuki what he thinks about it <br><br> Toshiyuki responds by saying that other people told him this too, but (he thinks) it's not just because of iDOLM@STER that Miura suggested him to be the director <br><br> Interviewer says "Well, you say that, but sensei might have thought differently." <br><br> Dumb hag in the middle spews stupid shit <br><br> Interviewer asks Miura who he likes in the franchise <br><br> Miura: "Chi-chan." <br><br> Interview: "I'm sorry, who?" <br><br> Miura: "Chihaya." <br><br> Toshiyuki's face when <br><br> Miura: "I'm sure you can tell from looking at Casca , but I like the fact that Chihaya is stoic." <br><br> Interviewer: "I see. iDOLM@STER and Berserk are connected, in the sense of stoic." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want HxH back more to be honest<br><br>let's face it, elf island is bound to be disappointing, it doesn't even have the potential to be good <br><br>on the other hand dark continent is hype as fuck and full of potential that shit writes itself<br><br>look in your heart you know it to be true</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First I'm a huge hipster for hemmingway and now I'm captain normalfag for paprika<br>For fucks sake. <br>That is exactly why I chose paprika<br>I figured it would take away the "you just want to be a special hipster" ammo.<br><br>But no. you took an hour and came back with this embarrassingly poor response. <br><br>You could take anything apart like that. <br>Which is exactly why you persisted on asking for an example and why I didn't want to give you one.<br>This is exactly how every idiot argues when he doesn't want to admit something he likes is childish or just stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> revenge is something teenagers find cool <br><br>The hell?

I assume you´re the same guy that is trying to put down Berserk, by saying it has nothing to offer anyone but nostalgia?<br><br>I was the one calling you on your almost incomprehensible hellbent opinion spreading. <br><br>Apologize to the other guy at least, seems like he was genuinely trying to understand you, and you confuse him with me.

Might be the most misguided person I have come across this month, yeah worse than those Sword Art Online worshippers.</br>  <br>True. The couple of threads after the announcement where great.<br><br>Please guys, filter the fucking tripfags.</br></br></br>  <br>Guts is an elven prince, calling it.</br>  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHA holy shit Miura you awesome son of a bitch.

I don't think it would change anything, it's not like Zodd would have magical genes that transfer to Guts, since the apostles have different forms just for their own bodies. That father-son plot could also make Guts a special snowflake, which I'd hate.</br>  I'm 27 and just watched the most recent films and got into it. Fuck you guys  I'm 21 and I got into berserk about a month ago. I always saw the rape scene gifs or people commenting on it and I needed to know the context, so I watched the movies. I then read the manga and I fucking loved it.  <br> Not reading the manga <br>it's insanely better<br>80% less CG</br></br></br>  <br>Berserk is edgy.<br><br>People who post on 4chan have a bad habit of using words they don't know the definition of. Like Mary Sue. <br><br>Edgy is when something is cutting edge and/or pushes or on the boundaries of what's socially acceptable. <br><br>A 23 year old neckbeard in a trenchcoat with a katana is being mocked for trying to be edgy and failing bad at it, it's used sarcastically or ironically to describe that kind of person</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they could spice it up by making guts absolutely disgusted by it</br>  <br>whatever cuck</br>  <br> 80% less CG <br>Are you a madman or just half-witted?<br><br>By definition it's 100% less CG</br></br></br></br>  <br>We live in the age of cheap CG. Doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. I enjoyed guts first "mini boss battle" more than the anime. Possibly because his eye popped out but not necessarily.</br>  <br>I think he meant that the movies were 80% CG, and the manga has none.</br>  <br> Implying Miura draws all that crazy background detail by himself <br>That's CG, he pretends he draws it so he has more time for moe</br></br>  <br>So Berserk is the former, the good kind of edgy</br>  <br>Guts will rape Griffith as Casca watches</br>  <br> Griffith will enjoy it <br> Griffith wants more Berserker cock, he becomes Guts' salve </br></br>  <br>Casca will recover her memories and will follow  The man who did make her cum, </br>  What do you read Berserk for?

Saving this bitch  <br> Makes Berserk a monthly manga again <br><br>There are people who actually belive this?</br></br></br>  <br>Miura is a god among men when it comes to production. I don't get why though, he shouldn't work that much into every little detail.</br>  <br>He didn't go monthly last year.</br>  <br><br>I hope we don't have to wait for another hundred years.</br></br>  <br> morons believe a moron <br>What a surprise.</br></br>  How can I be the only one who finds Puck cute?  <br><br>Nah I think Puck is cute, I wish he wasn't shown as a chibi so damn much.</br></br>  <br>Probably because you're a raging faggot</br>  <br>I think his chestnut form is okay. Not as cute as his regular form.<br><br><br>How?</br></br></br></br>  Your reaction when this happened?  <br>Everyone thinks he's cute.

If you emphasize 普通 then it is more likely to be insulting, I think. If the dude you're talking to comments on some girl being ugly and you reply by saying she's 普通に可愛いじゃん then you're saying you think she's actually pretty cute</br>  <br>According to the first Yahoo Answer link I found through google it's like this 【ブス】＜【普通に可愛い・普通に綺麗】＜【可愛い・綺麗】＜【超可愛い・<wbr>超綺麗】. The guy who told you it means one step above ugly seems to be correct although according this this Yahoo Answer it seems to be more "one step above nothing/average".</wbr></br>  <br> according this this Yahoo Answer it seems to be more "one step above nothing/average". <br>This is how I would usually interpret it<br>【ブス】＜【地味】＜【普通に可愛い・普通に綺麗】＜【可愛い・綺麗】＜【<wbr>超可愛い・超綺麗】</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Slight correction. Rikai tell me that ブス means homely woman or plain-looking woman but google images shows only ugly woman.</br>  <br>root double, white album 2, dies irae and muramasa off the top of my head</br>  <br>Yeah, I saw that, but if you scroll down you'll see other people with the same question and slightly different answers. One person even said it's a compliment. But, well, it's the internet, so I'm sure there are retards and trolls mixed in.<br><br>At any rate, more people definitely seem to see it as negative.</br></br></br>  <br>But that probably has more to do with how its heard subjectively. I'm guessing that it's like saying "you look young for your age". Many woman will take it as a compliment and many others will through a fit. Calling someone "normally cute" might be a compliment to some and not one to another(the cuter ones I'd imagine).</br>  So what languages do you plan on learning after Japanese? I want to learn Chinese, but not because I have any interest it in outside of just learning the language itself. I wonder if that will be enough to push through.  <br>I uploaded two entire sentence packs from AJATT to MEGA. Lemme get them for you.<br>Sci-Fi Pack: https://mega.co.nz/#!v9BFBZSb!N6Tu3<wbr>fYYR6TvE50Yc0wufA26GAOnEgMOJrkmLC6z<wbr>yhE<br><br>My first sentence pack: https://mega.co.nz/#!vogGzIYa!l1c2m<wbr>T4alCAc-s_P3GIucm14x93Vdpvh-pJCzI41<wbr>tx4<br><br>Sentences are way better than pure words, since you learn them in context and you kind of absorb the grammar by osmosis. More fun to do it that way, too.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>busu is also just used as a general insult for females. It means ugly, but is often times used on cute girls as well if they are not as attractive as others. If you watch akb48 media they will call each other busu a lot, and there are busu kyara but they are actually attractive compared to the average person.</br>  <br>Russian or maybe Chinese like yourself. To have something to do when I don't feel like studying Japanese. I think I'll be occupied with Japanese for a while longer.</br>  <br>The problem is knowing when to stop. I don't want to start Chinese because I don't want to stop Japanese, even though I'm at a pretty good level. I've been studying for 3 years, but I am still learning of course. I'll stick with Japanese for now.</br>  <br>I'm learning spanish because it's easy enough that I can just add 10 sentence cards to anki a day and still feel like I'm making progress.</br>  腹上死  <br>  It means ugly, but is often times used on cute girls as well if they are not as attractive as others. If you watch akb48 media they will call each other busu a lot, and there are busu kyara but they are actually attractive compared to the average person. <br>That doesn't really say much about the word ブス, just about media. Just like how the girls who are uglier by setting in hollywood films are still usually really hot.</br></br>  <br> I read this and the second in the series and it was boring as shit. <br>The second one is so good though.<br><br> Read prince of nothing <br>I'll check it out.<br><br><br>I also read portuguese books though that is not fair because that is my native language. The other anon said it the best already. People interested in languages will eventually be interested in books. You'll probably reach the point where you'll stop reading manga/VN yourself and move on to novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just telling you the usage of it. It is a general insult that means ugly, but it isn't all that insulting and it's thrown around quite a bit.</br>  <br> The second one is so good though. <br>Actually, I liked the first a lot more than the second. I just didn't like how it turned into too much of an "adventure" type book. Kind of like The Hobbit or Alice in Wonderland. I much prefer the style where the world is more known (while still being fantasy) and is developed more, rather than the main character encountering some crazy monster, getting out of the situation, and then the monster never coming up again.</br></br>  <br>And also it's only used for females.</br>  <br> but it isn't all that insulting and it's thrown around quite a bit. <br>I doubt actual Japanese people not already being paid a bunch for being cute would feel the same way.<br><br><br>There's ブサメン for males</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The second one is so good though. <br>Have you read the sequel? It's also good, but it takes a bit of a different approach and some might think they'd be better of not having read it.</br></br>  What is some good listening practice for beginners?

Haven't finished, lost interest.<br>Also haven't read the fourth one either for obvious reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a pretty casual insult. People even say it about themselves. Like "I don't want to cry because I will be busu".<br><br>I don't know why you're just guessing at things when you clearly don't have much experience with actual Japanese media.</br></br></br>  <br>The Pokemon anime is pretty simple. Although this is similar to reading Yotsubato in the sense that it doesn't really prepare you all that well for more normal stuff.</br>  <br>Ah, thought you were talking about the third and forth part. My two books are separated into the first and second, and third and forth part. I was talking about the Urth of the New Sun.</br>  <br>How much of a beginner? Honestly I don't think you should bother with material meant for natives, no matter the target group, until you're at least like N4. Find some audio meant for learners, like in textbooks with audio CDs.</br>  <br>Oh didn't know that, the e-book I downloaded is split into 4 parts. <br><br>Haven't read urth either. Rather I didn't know it existed til like 4 minutes ago.</br></br></br>  <br>Watching something besides idol shows.<br><br>In fact, stop watching idol shows while you're at it.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't working my way up to more difficult stuff better than just jumping straight into the lion's den.<br><br><br>I actually do have some audio practice CDs but muh anime.

Otherwise fuck off.</br>  <br>Yea there's a bunch of books in the universe actually, if you can call it that. That's the only one directly connected to tbotns though.</br>  <br> Care to show me a source where it's used as a very mean insult? <br>ブスが使われてる場面をいちいち覚えてるわけねえだろ<br>まあお前がどう思ってもお前の勝手だが<br>女をブス呼ばわりして怒られたら知らないからな？</br></br></br></br>  Leave the memes to the Japanese<br>https://<span>youtu.be/9iOcfZxj_8k?t=2m1s<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> mfw people switch to broken japanese when they don't have an argument in an attempt to scare some newfag off </br>  ブス！<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=L56<wbr>pz0lNWug</wbr>  [ ]</br>  This girl walks in and slaps your waifu's ass, what do you do?  <br>Threesome.</br>  <br><br>NTR Robaato-san from her.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Mary and Takeshi were the canon couple.</br>  Can I post?  <br><br> Implying they weren't swingers </br></br>  <br>Don't give a fuck about your fanfic delusions.

Tae Kim is arguable more of an intensive grammar study, while you'll have a solid foundation in both reading, listening and of course grammar if you do Genki. But you shouldn't do the class room exercise shit.  <br>You practice what you want to accomplish. It's not hard, if you want to learn to read you read. If you want to speak you speak.</br>  is there a resource that just has all the verb conjigations, and a quick 1-2 sentance explaining them in normal people terms? such as imperitive = giving an order, instead of all the complicated grammar terms?

All of them have several uses, and they require quite a complicated explanation. If you make it too simple, it simply becomes misleading and will cause you headaches when you get past the beginner level.</br>  Should I go through the trouble of adding vocab from VNs to a separate decklist before finishing Kore6k? <br><br>Currently I am about 1/3 into 6k and KD decks, started reading about a week ago. As I mostly read on my Vita  Amagami. I know reading with no text-hooker is a royal pain in the ass, but being able to read Sae-chan's route is one of my main motivations to try and do my best. Besides, it's not too extreme, I expected it to be much harder, considering my current level of knowledge , interrupting every minute to add words on Anki seems conter-productive, as it takes away from my concentration, and I am pretty sure that even if I do add reading vocab now, I'll still encounter 90% of them in core6k anyway, then why bother?</br></br>  <br>Try to find the Nihon Shock Cheat Sheet.

Why can't they just use Hiragana for everything? It's so much easier ;_;  <br>I think the hard part about Katakana is that you get much less practice with it.</br>  <br>I'm around ~2600 words into Core2k/6k and I started a mining deck a while ago, with around 1k+ words already in there after a few weeks-1 month of reading VNs. I just paste them to a word document and add them to anki thru Epwing2anki afterwards. If it's too much of a pain w/o a text hooker I wouldn't even bother with it, but for your next reading material I would definitely choose something that's on PC or otherwise easy to get text from so you can start a deck. I'm planning to stop adding new cards on core once it's at 3k words and start focusing more on my mining deck, but try stuff out and do whatever works for you.</br>  <br>i just started CAPITAL LETTERS today. why can't they just use lower case for everything? it's so much easier ;_;</br>  <br>Why do we even have capital letters?</br>  <br>Romans and Greeks.</br>  <br>SO THAT WE CAN EXPRESS OUR RAGE THROUGH TEXT</br>  <br>The same reason Katakana exist.<br><br><br>Although I'm the first one to spit on memrise, the site can be useful to practice your Katakana skills, learn some words and overall get used to them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why does katakana exist?</br>  <br>Be happy you don't speak german<br>English capitalisation is extremly easy<br> Not that german capitalisation isn't but you need to pay more attention </br></br></br>  <br>To trigger your autism.</br>  <br>Why don't the japs have capital hiragana and katakana?

If you want to use reading to learn then you need to have something with a lot of text and you have to actually _study_ it in some way, not just read it.</br></br></br></br></br>     You're learning Japanese so you can understand weird shit like this <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e22<wbr>VnQF4NtQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Such an odd people the Japanese.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll just save this for later</br>  Anyone know a list similar to that of English SAT to increase advanced Japanese vocab?  <br>The best translators are often good writers, and the best writers are often good readers. Read more and write more and you'll find your translation skills will improve. <br><br>That said, the translation is fine, I guess. It's not something easy to translate because the idea of the "flow" isn't something we really talk about in English.

This is a dialect commonly spoken among sluts.</br>  <br>Reminder (from Ixrec's grammar guide on second person pronouns)<br> お前 (おまえ) you the default second-person pronoun (especially for males) <br> 君 (きみ) you more friendly than おまえ, implying that there is some sort of relationship <br> 貴方 (あなた) you a second-person pronoun used by females, sometimes used specifically to address her husband <br> あんた you a more colloquial version of あなた without the strong connotations <br> てめ you used primarily to express contempt of the subject. Also, attaching め to the end of any noun or pronoun conveys the same nuance of contempt. <br> 貴様 (きさま) you essentially a more formal version of てめ. In some contexts this does not convey contempt, but rather an expectation of humility or submission. <br> お主 (おぬし) you a very old second-person pronoun </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh, i see, so it's like she's talking with her mouth hanging open or something</br>  <br>Yea. Another thing you'll see is dakuten being added to words. いぐ for example, instead of 行く.</br>  <br>What the fug is an Ixrec?</br>  I've been studying for about 1 year and a half, know a few thousand words and I'm still not sure what だって means.  <br>It means all kinda things depending on context, kinda like "fuck"</br>  <br> 君 (きみ) you more friendly than おまえ, implying that there is some sort of relationship <br>No, 君 can be used with strangers in the proper context. Policemen stereotypically use it, for example. Also, using お前 with close friends is very common. <br><br> てめ you used primarily to express contempt of the subject. Also, attaching め to the end of any noun or pronoun conveys the same nuance of contempt. <br>Except this め has nothing to do with the め in てめえ.<br><br>I don't know much about ixrec but it sounds like he's just pulling this out of his ass. If he's going to bother covering shit like お主 he might as well cover 汝 or 自分 as a second person pronoun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It can mean either "also/but" (similar to でも) or be a quote. It's also used to elaborate reasons, especially when arguing or trying to convince the other person. <br><br>It would help if you posted specific examples, because explaining a grammar point/word that has so many uses is difficult without being specific.</br></br></br>  <br><br>By the way, since you two were nice enough to help me. Is it okay if most of the time I read けど at the end of sentences as a mood-marker-word(I don't know if I'm getting my meaning across) like よ? Because it almost never seems to mean "but" unless it's at the beginning or in a sentence.</br></br>  <br>I think you've got some problematic assumptions you're working on. No, けど doesn't always mean "but" in English, but that shouldn't be something surprising. It gives the listener room to interject and can make the difference between a natural and an unnatural sentence.</br>   looking up top reasons to learn english because i'm convinced its not worth it <br> most of the reasons are to get paid more money <br> doesn't matter if you already have a good job <br><br>Why bother learning English?</br></br></br></br>  <br>to my mind, it's almost exactly like ending an english sentence with "but..."<br><br>it sort of expresses doubt/uncertainty and prompts the other person to speak. like you hear people answer the phone and say 失礼けど… meaning something like "i know it's rude, but... [may i ask who is calling?]"</br></br></br>  <br>75% of all media is in English one way or another, so you'll have a lifetime of entertainment available.</br>  <br>Unless you're Japanese or Chinese (or a normalfag) other countries' internet suck immensely. Learning English is vital.</br>  <br>Because buddhist monks needed something consistent and easy to teach, and hiragana was still hentaigana.</br>  <br>Movies are way too hard to understand in english, and would take years upon years of practice to get to the point where you can listen to them, its simply not worth it for movies.<br><br>Most english tv shows are mediocre, who cares if you can understand lyrics to a song or not, and with the internet, you aren't missing out on anything.<br><br>Literally no reason to ever learn English if you have a well paying job</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop posting this you faggot retard<br>It's not even good bait<br><br><br>I could watch English movies and understand them perfectly when I was 13, after 2 years of middle school and playing english videogames</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your average person is exposed to English enough nowadays that he'll learn it whether he tries to or not.</br>  <br>English is such an easy language even a gorilla could learn it without trouble.</br>  <br>There's something you don't quite seem to understand, please pop your bubble.<br><br>Most people learn English in a passive way without even trying because it's literally everywhere. You don't even need to open a book or having followed classes back in school. As a non-native all you need is a functioning brain and being at least interested in a few things.</br></br></br>  <br>That's great, however there's no reason to intentionally try and learn english, just as we are trying to learn japanese</br>    I'm not trying to bait, i genuinely see no reason to learn english, or any language that isn't japanese or a language spoken in your hometown, for that matter  watching the revival of f right now on mute because it's the spanish dub and I don't speak spanish<br><br>can someone please explain to me how the hell frieza is able to punch gohan in the stomach? he shouldn't even be able to touch him! (even in gohan's base form)<br>why are any of the z fighters struggling with this fight!? <br>this should be a curb stomp battle<br><br>seriously, wtf?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because cartoons for kids. now fuck off.</br>   watching something with no sound and wonders why something he doesn't know about is happening <br>How can DBZ fans get anymore retarded?</br>  <br><br>1/10<br><br>You gotta bait better than this, son</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm asking for someone who speaks either japanese or spanish to explain it to me<br><br>you call me retarded but you are clearly dense as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>what part of I don't speak spanish sounds like bait to you?<br><br>also, are you NOT so excited to see a new dragon ball z movie that you wouldn't watch it on mute just to see it?<br><br>filthy casual</br></br></br></br></br>  my hope here is to find an answer without getting other spoilers<br><br>anyone care to explain?</br></br>  nevermind, goku showed up and everything is normal again<br><br>I'll read spoilers later</br></br>  <br>The power level in the movies is fucked up</br>  <br>yeah, but I thought this movie was canon<br><br>this blue hair thing though is not making me excited for dragon ball super</br></br></br>  <br>which, looking now, OH FUCK IT'S UP<br><br>http://gogoanime.tv/dragon-ball-sup<wbr>er-episode-1</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It's not. <br><br>Super is canon. Movies are being retconned and maybe Frieza shit won't even happen</br></br></br>  <br>this <br><br>the movies were more of an introduction to super tbh <br><br>chances are all the side stuff that happened in BoG and RoF are going to be changed significantly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy your ban</br>  <br>well it's not like anything of value was lost, but I hate this gimmicky back and forth bullshit</br>  We Went to Look at the Stars<br><br>Was pretty underwhelmed by first episode, but the ruler game was somehow exciting, and the origin of Hotarun's crush was very sweet. This episode felt like a return to form to me.<br><br>Any guesses how they'll get motivated during Holiday Break? Natsumi-centric episode next week?<br><br>Non-shit NNB thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I played this game at school as well, but we called it 'Coiny' and you won by shooting the closest one to you through the other coins 3 times in a row. Used to play it with these heptagonal fucks as well to make it harder to win and way more painful to lose</br>  <br> tfw you'll never be a little girl who loves other little girls </br>    <br>SHORYUKEN</br>  Repeat beach ep when  God Eater Episode 1 thoughts?<br><br>Firstly I would like to say the animation looks really weird and not weird in a good way.</br></br>  Everything expect for visuals is shit so far. Fashionable, trap-bodied kids don't fit the setting in the least. I was holding some semblance of hope until absolutely retarded shonen moment happened.<br> You can't go <br> I must <br>And then you get a fucking slowmo and cheesy music to show how fucking cool this little faggot is for disobeying to save his friends. <br>Even better that he nearly gets wrecked because he's a stupid idiot who can't even wield his weapon properly. But it'a all okay because we are treated to edgy ass trio. I couldn't help but cringe during a sequence where some random asshole is walking around with his cigarette and killing enemies with ease while talking about random bullshit just to further show how little of a challenge the monsters are.<br>This show is shit, fundamentally. The fact that it tries to take a more or less gritty approach instead of being self-aware is making it even worse.<br>This show is a waste of talented people who work on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I kinda like it, but it's extremely hit or miss. <br><br>The outlining on far away characters looks pretty odd, and they pretty often completely ignore the shape of the face when shading in some other scenes. Changing the line colour based on what it's outlining is a bit strange at times too.<br><br>When it looks good though, it looks like an animated version of game artwork which is pretty neato. And they deserve some credit for actually trying, it can't be particularly easy to animate things with shading as complex as that for a regular TV broadcast.</br></br></br></br>  Poor Alisa, her Yuu is gone.<br><br>Will Lenka and Alisa have harem antics?<br><br> Yuu is canon in alot of works that intertwine with game <br> create Lenka <br> female MC Aki is in canon works along with Yuu <br> Lenka <br> no female MC partner <br><br>Why do they treat Lenka so?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the Aldnoah.Zero of 2015? Or just a repeat of OnS funposting?  Will the MC die in the last episode so we can get Yuu in GE2 the animation?  I think we need a new Overlord thread.  <br>Sexually dominating her vampire brides doesnt count.</br>    <br>And since  Arche  got quartered and what not,  she can't request Papa Bones to give her Shalltear's virginity either . Maybe her little sisters will get privilege, in future that is?</br>  <br>That is one poofy dress.</br>  <br>True<br><br>I shouldn't allow myself to partake in conversation with those of shit taste</br></br></br>  Is Madoka Magica any good?  <br>other than homu being first it is hard to rank the magicas in terms of looks, they are all so good.</br>  <br>She does have a loli though.<br>love comes in all shapes and sizes.</br></br>  <br>we hit image cap and almost hut post cap on the last one. These threads not only re spawn quickly, but have a pretty long life span. i don't see the problem though.</br>  What's the point of having being a tripfag?  <br>you're wrong but don't let that bother you<br><br>i have images dating back to 2011 before the show aired to spam in your face</br></br></br>  Hayate no Gotoku<br>Combat Butler faster than the wind.</br>  <br><br>Finally got past the sol/comiket arc and back to some classic ridiculousness. Too bad Maria is still pretty much forgotten about, she's one of the best girls.<br><br><br><br>Hayate is eternal, it will never end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Hata wants it to end.</br>  Can you pinpoint the exact moment when the manga went to shit?  <br>I don't wanna say I like it but I do.<br>Suck it Kumetafags.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully<br><br>Me neither.
