[ Hey there. Dumping a medieval fantasy series, by the author of Tokyo Girls Destruction, Girl Friend, etc.). This got a brief English publication by CPM, but then they died.<br><br> Medieval adventure with a modern twist! Bright-eyed Prince Star left the comfortable life of his father's castle behind in order to search the lands for thrills and adventure. Of course, he should've been more careful for what he wished for, because the young Prince soon finds himself surrounded by a slew of unsavory characters, and perhaps a cute girl or two. </br></br>  <br>Cute art style.</br>        <br><br>It looks fun.</br></br>    I've heard good things about Ashita Dorobou, but I have not read it yet.                                                        <br>I've read Girl Friend and I really adore the art. Thanks for sharing</br>      op, are you gonna upload this somewhere? i don't really want to save this one page at a time.                          <br>There are programs/add-ons for that, you know.</br>                                    Man, the author really doesn't give a shit about maintaining the 4th wall at all, does he.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Has there ever been a more sensual manga than Berserk? <br><br>And no i don't mean borderline porn with tits and dumb bitches with their tongues out i mean pure raw sensuality on a fucking black and white page.</br></br>  Also related, Farnese makes my dick rock hard  <br>One of the better pages.<br><br> oh, shes not possessed... </br></br></br>  <br>Know dat feel</br>  <br>Would lick the blood off those pecs no homo</br>  <br> tfw no more crazy sexually frustrated Farnese <br> fucking CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT <br> they'll never get out of the damn boat <br>Why Miura why?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Farnese suddenly completely reboots her character from "sexually frustrated zealot currently in huge doubt about her own faith toward God and her own beliefs toward the doctrine and the nature of God himself" to "man i fucking love magic" <br><br>MIURA</br></br></br>  <br><br> entire faith shattered by guts/demons <br> only person you love doesn't want to sex you up <br> know the world is ending and you're too weak to do anything <br><br>Her change was handled well, I just hope we see Casca go from drooling idiot back to delicious brown tsundere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She can stay drooling... I wouldn't mind.</br>  <br>I will miss retardasca if this happens</br>  <br>Casca dosent want to remember bro, SK pretty much said that shit.</br>  <br>I fapped to a lot of berserk pages.<br><br>Rape ones included(Casca too), it's hot as fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br> gads <br><br>wtf</br></br></br></br>  <br>edgy</br>  <br>Eclipse rape made me fap twice.</br>  <br>Well yeah I tend to edge a lot, it feels better when you finally let it go.<br><br>Meh it wasn't that hot, other rapes were better</br></br></br>  Shut Hell.  <br> tfw you will never get to whip Guts until you are about to orgasm. </br>  <br>Are those dudes going to kill each other?</br>  <br>Think that wolf manga or the one with like 20 chapters of rape.</br>  <br>Oh, don't worry.<br>Shut Hell is giving Mongol Guts the mother of all hickeys.</br></br>  <br>Did somebody ask for wolfrape?<br><br>I guess that's enough Shut Hell for now.<br>Give it a shot, it's pretty sweet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the art for this looked like shit coming from the mangaka who did Hellsing, but some research revealed that I have been confusing Shut Hell and Drifters for ages.</br>  Is Berserk still running? Last time I heard about it it was like 10 years going.  <br>New chapter in a few days. Scanlations some time after that.</br>  <br>Well, there's a LOT of Rapefaces going on.<br>And that's kinda Hirano's specialty.<br><br>But in general, they share sort of a sketchy quality.<br>However I prefer the loose, scribbley quality of Itoh's art as opposed to Hirano's thick, blockey lines and gigantic black spaces.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The color pages are awesome, but the best pages are those with teeth. His wolves are great as well.</br>  <br>I kinda wish he'd explore the spiritual side of things a bit. not explicit them, just remember they're here. Like when Alfald suddenly had a conversation with Yurul in the snowstorm and when the dead warriors told Shut Hell not to forget them. They're kinda drowned out in the rest of the story, and that's a bit sad.</br>  <br>Fucking Jiglus! Why?!<br><br>You seemed like such a cool dude. <br>Why couldn't you just team-up with Shut Hell and Yurul?<br>You could have taken Harabal down easily together.<br><br>But you were dead to me the moment you  killed Mr. Ibahra .<br><br><br>I like that the supernatural elements are in the background.<br>It's still in a pseudo-historical setting.<br>The story isn't going to end with Shut Hell killing Genghis Khan (even though he got an almost cartoonish villainy upgrade).<br>Although maybe I shouldn't be too fast here, since they just introduced a girl that can basically mindcontrol animals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss depraved twintails Farnese</br>  Minna~ which one wa anata desu-ka?  What is wrong with you?  <br>What is this, 2007?<br>Your summer is showing, newfriend.</br></br>  <br>Are you on drugs or some shit? What the fuck.</br>  <br>I miss 2007</br>  What pun?  <br>His voice makes me want to kill myself</br>  <br><br>His voice acting is probably killing himself as well.</br></br>  <br>Everyone's voice fucking sucks. Goku's is the worse.<br><br> probably 2+ years until dub <br>Kill me</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gohan's is the worst. He sounds like a fag</br></br>  <br>Goku, Gohan, and Goten are all the same old lady</br>  <br>He has to, or the Japanese fans will threaten Toryiama again because they'll think Gohan is going to start doing anything again, and Japanese fans don't want that.</br>  Do people actually watch Dragon Ball after Dragon Ball?<br>And how do you watch it in Japanese? Everyone sounds like a granny</br>  <br>So, we are going to watch battle of gods again, but on a ship and with more building up and stuff?<br>Well, Í guess I have the "this is my wife" scene to look up to, even if it's going to happen in like a month or so.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, when I realized this is just Battle of Gods: the show I felt pretty deflated about the whole series</br>  <br><br>Why the fuck does he sound bored?</br></br>  <br>Here's a better pun.<br><br><br>He's a really, really old man.<br>He's the worst voice in the show thus far, people who hate goku's voice are mad dubfags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> people who hate goku's voice are mad dubfags. <br><br>Know, we just know what Goku is SUPPOSED to sound like, and it's not some old granny. I'm so mad they aren't dubbing this first, we deserve it. DBZ is way more popular in America and even the Japanese know Sean Schemmel is a better goku (Nozawa herself said it at a con once) and that we have the better dub. It's pathetic they even bother doing it in jap anymore, it makes my ears bleed its so bad. People think shit like 4Kids is bad? This is 10x worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant no instead of know im just so pissed people actually think we're just angry cuz its different or whatever that I made a typo its true we're angry but because its an OLD LADY not GOKU.</br>  <br>The worst VA performance I've seen ever in anime.<br><br>Even some Z tier anime had better deliverance.<br><br>If he is dying just let him rest in peace, when Kai is running and being angry at Goku while sounding while he is whispering something from 5 meters it is bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are you pulling shit out of your ass?</br></br>  <br>I don't know how people can like the jap dub. Everyone sounds like preschoolers, it's ridiculous.</br>   Every DBS thread <br> WHY DOES EVERYONE SOUND LIKE OLD LADIES <br> DUB WHEN :D </br></br>  <br>Maybe it's a sign that most people would rather it dubbed???</br>  <br><br>Literally never happened.</br></br>  The pun is basically "Peace is nice". Heiwa hei wa  <br> said it at a con once <br>Oh well in that case.<br><br><br>And not knowing what dub means, someone's on a roll today.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a sign that dbs threads are filled with crossboarders.<br>I don't think people from fucking /v/ would complain about the dub because all the games had japanese voices so I don't know where the fuck this people came from.</br></br>  <br>Alright let's go through this step by step<br> I'm so mad they aren't dubbing this first, we deserve it.  <br>When has this ever happened<br> DBZ is way more popular in America <br>Than Japan? That's a good joke m8<br> and even the Japanese know Sean Schemmel is a better goku  <br>That's literally impossible<br> (Nozawa herself said it at a con once <br>No she didn't<br> . It's pathetic they even bother doing it in jap anymore, it makes my ears bleed its so bad.  <br>I am pretty sure most of these complaints are a problem with you and not the home country itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Goku, Gohan, and Goten are all the same old lady <br>I do get the point of keeping Goku's VA the same, to show that he is still the same childish character as in Dragonball.<br>But why did they decide it'd be a good idea to use same lady as voice actor for all of his family?</br></br></br>   Beerus says he's the reason dinosaurs went extinct <br> Dragon Ball world is full of dinosaurs <br> Beerus not just blowing up the planet <br>Fuck, I'm mad. It makes no sense.</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe it's a sign that most people would rather it dubbed??? <br> ??? <br>Or maybe its a sign that like 75% of you are casual newfag shitposters who only watched the show as a child and expect everything to go your way.<br><br>Seriously, anybody who says "Hurr why isn't the show being released in English" first deserves to be laughed at</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Dragon Ball world is full of dinosaurs </br>  <br> I don't think people from fucking /v/ would complain about the dub because all the games had japanese voices so I don't know where the fuck this people came from. <br>Do you think they wouldn't listen to the games dubbed if they had the choice because "m-muh heroic Goku"</br></br>   All these newfags forced to watch the original language and it's unknown when Funimation will get it <br><br>And I like the dub these days too. It's just really fun to watch. I hope they don't get it until after it ends like Buu Kai just so I can see the suffering continue</br></br>  <br>There were literally dinosaurs in episode 2. Is Toriyama this senile?</br>  <br><br>lets not forget<br><br> he saw a dinosaur in the previous episode </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Agreed unless you're that fag penguintruth who thinks that Japanese is superior</br></br></br></br>  <br> tumblr <br>It was a totally different planet.</br></br>  <br><br>to be fair, it was on a different planet, not Earth</br></br>  Toiei should've seriously replaced some of the voice actors. A few of them are too old to continue forcing their voices  <br>Do you really think Toriyama is writing the script again?<br>He only gave TOEI the general outline of the story, nothing else.</br></br>  <br>It's really just Kaio. The others sound pretty much as they always have. Kaio is straight up dying though. I don't even know why he's here. Maybe after BoG, he will sit out of the rest of the series since he wasn't in RoF</br>  <br>Goku sounds so bad.</br>  <br><br><br> different planet <br><br>But he made out he barely remembered what dinosaurs were, regardless of where they came from</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Unfortunately, Toei doesn't realise that DB is better at selling outside Japan than inside of it. Obviously its still hyper popular in Japan but the outside market is bigger. <br><br><br> Sean Schmell  <br> good <br><br>The best Goku is the Teamfourstar one. I would love to see them tackle it seriously and create their own shit from it. They are talented as far as voice acting goes, much better than anyone in Funimation. Fuck, even Ocean Groups dub had better voice acting but suffered heavily from underbudgeting which allowed Funimation to get its foot in the door and ruin hundreds of series with their half arsed 'use the same voice' characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only good English dub for Dragon Ball Z is WeeklyTubeShow.  <br> Unfortunately, Toei doesn't realise that DB is better at selling outside Japan than inside of it. Obviously its still hyper popular in Japan but the outside market is bigger. <br>no one cares about gohan in the west either, just you guys</br></br>   Dubshits will never go away   <br>It's not that Teamfourstar are particulary great, they are just better than the shitty Funimation cast.</br>  The Dub isn't even remotely good. Tien still isn't called "Tenshinhan" or Krillin being "Kulilin."  <br>did it ever cross your mind that maybe they're from /a/ and that maybe having a granny voice goku's entire bloodline and an old man on his deathbed voicing kaio isn't such a good idea?</br>  <br>/a/? The people who shame dubfags on sight?</br>  <br> All the games had japanese voices <br><br>But no one actually uses them retard, we don't want granny goku.</br></br></br>  <br>Still better then Granny Goku or little girl Krillin.</br>  <br>Still better than the japanese version<br><br>Doesn't make my ears bleed.</br></br></br>  <br> Tien still isn't called "Tenshinhan" <br>Will and William.<br> Krillin being "Kulilin." <br>I'm fine with that. Kulilin is a pain to actually say.<br><br>Shut the fuck up, holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure it is. If it's so better, why Superman's entire character to Goku? <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fmf<wbr>yp_4JpUE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Do you have any reason why Nozawa is not a good VA other than "o-old woman!"<br><br> I am being epic baited aren't I </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a fandub right? This can't be what people are defending, it just can't</br>  <br>Because she sounds like shit? How the fuck else are you suppose to answer this question? <br><br>Goku literally sounds like an old lady whose been smoking all her life.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it's not! <br><br>Sean Schemmel still sounds fresh from the street, Sabat still screams all the time to try and be funny and the only one remotely good is Kaio. The problem isn't the show, It's you people being so ignorant because a company supplied your ignorance with censored garbage like Toonami.</br></br></br></br>  Does anyone else actually really like king kai in the new series? I think his new voice and attitude are perfect for his character. Even when he gets mad you just can't take him seriously and it seems much more natural when he gets no respect from everyone else in the cast.  <br> Not posting links to the updated dub </br>  <br> This dumb, and lighthearted character doesn't sound like a serious, badass, manly man! <br><br>Show me a single woman who sounds like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Nozawa is fine voice actor. She good with kids and even like her in Tamers as Guilmon/Dukemon<br><br>But not Goku. It's bad as Goku. Goku is not child nor granny he should sound like Sean.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and Goku, Gohan, Krillen and Goten <br><br>still sound like shit in the japanese version<br><br>I'm fairly sure people can name more shit voices in the Japanese version than the dub</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, you said "Dub". you didn't specify which. Ocean? Funi? Neo-Funi with Kai?</br></br>  <br>I'd be fine if they didn't animate him freaking out while the VA is calm.</br>  <br><br>He still sounds cringy. He's forcing himself to be all dramatic yet it falls flat. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=75g<wbr>UJ_4SyY0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  I had the same attitude towards Goku's japanese VA until I actually watched the original show in jap. It's painfully obvious that the dubshitters in this thread hasn't  <br>Yeah and old granny Goku is so much better right? <br><br>Haha</br></br></br>  <br>I'm with you brother. I used to hate the idea of JP Goku until I started playing UT with the Japanese voices then went back to watch the series after that. I can't imagine going back to the dub now.</br>  <br><br>That's because people don't watch at all.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xKR<wbr>GZdgtncg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy and sure it might've been a better decision to change Goku's VA after he becomes an adult. but it's better than the entire cast being garbage. Your logic makes zero sense</br>  <br>Funny, I always thought Kid Goku and Gohan had the voice of an old lady whose been smoking all her life in the american dub.<br>I prefer Nozawa's voice for Goku, because at least it keeps the lightheartedness of the character.</br></br>  <br><br>How would Beerus know he extincted the dinosaurs? You really think he has the patience to be so meticulous as to kill them all without blowing up the planet? Fucking BEERUS?</br></br>  Every single time.  <br>She sounds find voicing children and retarded dinosaurs.<br><br>Congrats. She shouldn't voice men in their 30s - 50s.<br><br>You faggots find me a man that sounds like her voice for Goku.<br><br>Voicing Goten and Gohan as kids is fine</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hjv<wbr>e9s90DRU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>You're damn right. She just says it in a simple tone, yet Sean has to sound dramatic to reach a point? Do these people know anything about voice acting?</br></br></br></br>  <br>All he had to do was blast the planet as hard as the asteroid did.</br>  <br> Dramatic scene  <br> Not sounding dramatic <br><br>Okay</br></br></br></br>  <br>The dub is good but I don't cry about muh voices.<br><br>I'm enjoying this show for what it is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not what I mean. you're trying too hard to be dramatic when the scene itself isn't THAT dramatic.</br></br>  <br> still thinks the dinosaurs were made extinct by an asteroid <br><br>Beerus killed a bunch of dinosaurs, went "guess I'm done here," and then took a nap.</br></br></br>  Dragon Ball threads are allowed on /tv/ right? Why do you feel the need to come here?    <br> Saiyan just became the legend of his race and is about to fuck the person who enslaved and killed his entire race <br> Not dramatic </br></br>   Dirty americans can't enjoy Dragon Ball because of the dub <br> The same ones that didn't get Dragon Ball <br> The ones that got DBZ several years later than the rest of the world <br> The ones that censored Mr. Popo <br>TOPPEST KEK<br><br>We all know the Mexican dub is, literally, the best DB dub out there, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying DBS in Japanese because I'm not a dirty burgerfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still thinks the dinosaurs were made extinct by an asteroid <br>Is that not how it happened?</br></br>  <br>The problem is he's overacting in a scene he shouldn't.</br>  <br><br>What exactly do you mean? Find someone who's fit for guys? <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KfJ<wbr>b517Ec2k</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Angemon <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Qq<wbr>ZCGCOvxA</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Yusuke</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was born with a lisp and his voice being fucked. He even started smoking to make his voice sound different. He also got into fighting because of it.<br><br>So yeah okay bro nice</br></br></br>  <br><br>You should really read up on dinosaurs, anon. The asteroid theory is all but debunked at this point.</br></br>  <br><br>You are really this stupid, are you? how do you fail to see the words "Trying too hard"?</br></br>  <br> Posting Yusuke <br>Dub was better here too</br></br>  <br><br> Dub was better here too  <br><br>Yeah, you people really do have shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't trying hard at all.<br><br>Hell go compare the scene when Goku does SSJ3 or the fight between him and Vegeta.<br><br>She should stick to voicing children.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Being this retarded </br>  <br>There was no one specific cause. There was a whole lotta shit going on around the time they were dying off.</br>  I have to say I havent been impressed with any of the animation at all so far.  <br>Yeah, seems modern, but low budget. Embarrassing really.</br>  <br> Wasn't trying hard at all. <br><br>Listen to the part where he says "Pure of heart and awakened by fury." and tell me, with a straight face, how that's not trying so hard?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and so was Goku, your point?</br>  I don't get how ppl can defend the jap dub. it's pure shit.  <br>Kaiō’s pun — 平和がへいわー (heiwa ga hei waa) — set in the standard structure of “X is X” using homophones, roughly means “hooray, peace!”<br><br>Japanese puns are dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>No dude, seriously fuck off to whatever shithole you came from. These threads are nothing but cancer</br>  <br><br>They're only dumb because you weren't born Japanese and because Kaio's jokes are also not funny.</br></br>  First Majin Buu Kai and now this. What happened to US getting DBZ before Japan? That used to be the day.  <br><br>Hey, I'm from /v/, and I'm not here to bullshit you I'd prefer a dub since those voices are what I grew up with, but within like two episodes I learned to like the japanese version for what it is. Grandma Goku sounds weird but that's not too bad or something.<br><br>King Kai is fucking shit though. Don't defend it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seek help.</br>  <br>No he wasn't</br>  <br>Nah they're dumb period.</br>  <br>That's true enough. Kaio's puns are meant to be corny and unfunny, even by Japanese standards. Really, most of the time puns are used for the same effect in American cartoons. Here's lookin' at you, Carlos.</br>  <br>No, it's a cultural thing.<br>Old people like shitty puns, they need to be really bad to make an old man laugh.</br></br>  In all honestly, how can anyone like the Japanese version? Not even defending the eng dub but its just so fucking bad. One of the worst sounding anime out there.  <br>Because muh Japanese is superior to everything weeb logic.</br>  GT &gt; super <br>Ssj4 &gt; ssjgssjgssjgssj<br>Li Shenron &gt; Beerus, Freezer and other villains without a background story<br>Mustache Vegeta &gt; effeminate Vegeta throwing his pride away by dancing at a party<br>Mustache Krillin &gt; 3"11 dressed as a kid Krillin</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because Kaio's jokes are dumb, you imbecile.

Madhouse's anime quality seems dropped really hard since their staff moved to other studio like MAPPA (which founded by the ringleader of old madhouse, Maruyama Masao).<br><br>Probably the only competent staff left are Ishizuka Atsuko (too bad she got crap project like NGNL and Hanayamata), and Asaka Morio.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hanayamata and parasyte weren't bad<br><br>Chihayafuru s3 when</br></br>  <br> Then: Chihayafuru, Tatami Galaxy, Kaiji <br> Now: HotD, Chaos;Head <br>Just use the image, even it's better at baiting than you are.</br></br></br>  <br>MAPPA is the new Madhouse.

For starters, Trigun, Gungrave, Monster, Paprika, and Chobits are some of the worst anime in the industry.<br><br>Parasyte is objectively better than all of Madhouses older works, and HOTD was innovative, fresh and unique to have vampires in a industry full of MOESHIT.</br></br></br>  <br>The part when Ainz flies through the skies is pretty well done, even if they put in screen the character that isn't talking to save money.</br>  <br> MAPPA is the new Madhouse. <br> Zankyou no Terror - flop <br> Garo: The Animation - flop <br> Punchline - flop <br> Ushio to Tora - HxH animation teams - will flop <br>Seems pretty accurate. Will history repeat itself too? Will a big company buy MAPPA and rescue them in the future?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's car captor  <br>Come on at least put some effort into baiting</br>  <br>2/10 for bothering to put anything in the text box.</br>  <br> Mahouka <br><br>Don't you fucking hate on ONII-SAMA you little bitch.</br></br></br>    Madhouse need to go full Sunrise and release BD-BOX of their old shows by starting with Death Note.<br>I'm pretty sure they could make some good money from them.</br>  <br> madhouse then <br> Tatami Galaxy <br> madhouse now <br> HOTD <br>These aired in the same year. Are you just separating anime you like in the "then" category?</br></br></br></br></br>  Since these threads are usually day-long 500-post shitfests, how about we talk about something more interesting for once?<br><br>Which studios do you think will suffer in the next five-to-eight years?

Stupidity?</br></br></br>  <br>How is it pretentious?</br>  <br>You know what? You're right. Each episode is actually completely different because the fortune teller charges a different amount every time.</br>  <br> trying to make a cartoon for children artsy looking <br> trying to seem all ooh super deep twist ending yet turning to a tired, cliched being a hikki is bad is the moral of the story thing </br></br>  <br><br>This, TBH. Most overrated anime on /a/ next to Ping Pong.<br><br>Sora no Woto AOTY 2010.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now SnW is the very definition of overrated shit with an overly vocal circlejerking fanbase. It was good, but no way is it the masterpiece that people make it out to be.</br>  <br> Sora no Woto AOTY 2010. <br>Piss fetishist spotted.</br></br>  <br><br>SnW is Haibane Renmei done right.</br></br>   Chihayafuru <br> then <br>Retard.</br></br>  <br>What does "artsy-looking" mean, and why is that a bad thing? I've seen some shots of it and it looks nice.</br>  <br>I just thought it was silly. Its like complaining about Groundhog Day being repetitive.</br>  <br>SnW is Haibane Renmei done horribly wrong.</br>  <br>Does Mouryou no Hako count as then, or now. It's the evangelion of anime.</br>  <br>Artsy-looking is something that isnt done by kyoani. Everyone knows that. Its bad because its not normal.</br>  <br>Grand artistic statement of repetitiveness: Groundhog Day, Endless Eight<br>Pretentious drivel:<br>Tatami Galaxy<br>There's a difference.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Zankyou no Terror was terrible... </br>  <br>But then people complain about every KyoAni show looking the same.</br>  <br>Why don't you explain why TTG is "pretentious drivel"? You're coming off as pretentious, anon.</br>  Madhouse then:<br>Madhouse<br><br>Madhouse now:<br>Badhouse<br>MAPPA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If looking like KyoAni was the standard, anime would be better off. All of their shows look fantastic.</br>  <br>Nice buzzword there, buddy. Enjoying life and taking opportunities sure are fucking pretentious themes amrite?</br>  <br> Endless Eight <br>What? That's a prime example of drivel since it did nothing but waste everybody's time years ago and is pointless now.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off normalfag.</br>  <br>It's almost as if the point of making E8 eight episodes flew right over your head.<br><br>Hint:  It has something to do with Yuki. </br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme</br>  <br>An anime having themes at all is considered pretentious on /a/.<br>See<br/></br></br>  <br>Did you even read the thread? Are you new? It's been explained in this thread. It's been explained here repeatedly for years. The anime has been thoroughly rebuked by many as pretentious drivel here for years.</br>  <br>Too bad that doesn't work because literally just reanimating the same episode over and over just means people skip most of it.</br>  <br>You should try Reddit then</br>  <br> I can't elaborate <br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>Studio WIT. I like their art style but none of their shows ever sell.</br>  <br>In other words you're a bandwagoning retard with no argument.</br>  <br>You sound like the redditor, fag. Good anime is meant to be mindless escapism, everything else is the pretensions of people that failed to enter higher mediums.</br>  <br>I haven't watched it since I can't bring myself to watch things /a/ hates, but it doesn't really sound that pretentious. I was shocked after reading about it on /a/ for years to learn that it was just about collage.</br>  <br>Are you one of those people who thinks ping pong is pretentious because it's about playing ping pong?</br>  <br>It's pretentious because it's an aethetic abortion passed off as artsy and deep, like you're doing right now.</br>  <br> I can't bring myself to watch things /a/ hates <br>Wow, what a fag.</br></br>  <br> I haven't watched it since I can't bring myself to watch things /a/ hates <br>faggot</br></br>  <br> SnK <br> not selling <br>Even Owari no seraph reached 5k.

Glasses is the on he's on about.</br>  <br> It goes through the whole alphabet. <br>What the fuck does a Z look like, then?</br></br>  <br>aren't we all?</br>  <br>Sorta like a  google search </br>  <br><br>Can you explain how you're supposed to feel then?</br></br>  <br>This  is the Mayu story, go read it it's good.</br>  <br><br>That one's even worse!</br></br>  <br>I'm not keeping up with dank meme<br>What is this LONDON thingy<br> inb4 capital of england </br></br></br>  <br>How she straightened out.</br>  <br><br>With your hands</br></br>  <br>Oh my god... I just completely glossed over her name whilst reading it and didn't make the connection because I was going based purely off appearances looking back.</br>  <br>/fit/ ebin meme.<br><br>It was about some faggots hooking up "please be in london" responses.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a meme from /fit/ that has lost all context at this point, and originated with some dude asking if a person was from London. Use google.</br>  Mayu seems sweet. I'd date her and treat her nicely. Not like she needs it since she has her brother.<br><br>Shame stuff like  happens to her though.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks dear kind anons</br></br>  <br>every single fucking time</br>  <br>To be fair she's supposed to be acting retarded right there.</br>  <br>Typically, you wouldn't consider being mind-broken into a childlike state with an unhealthy sexual obsession with a family member a "positive" thing. <br><br>Finding the silver lining in this is like surviving a car accident that killed your whole family. It's really great that you figured out how to be positive, but your whole family is still dead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So the bully ended up becoming Tomo, Mayu ended up becoming Cotton Candy and glasses ended up becoming Misuzu?</br></br>  <br><br>And also the car raped you somehow</br></br>    <br><br> coming up to her after every class and saying 'Dummy' <br><br>This is the strangest yet most well-organized attempt at bullying I have ever seen</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd agree with you if it the doujin were actually the story of how she got raped and mind-broken, but it isn't, so I don't. Nothing bad happens to her in the story.<br><br><br>Mayu is glasses. You mean Ameri.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wait what the FUCK<br><br>THOSE ARE THE SAME MOTHERFUCKERS<br><br>WHAT<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>that just blew my fucking mind, is bring you down in my heart canon?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I dunno man what happens if Tomo is in the bathroom between classes instead of sitting at her desk?<br><br>Then her whole bullying schedule is ruined</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure, but she's clearly recovering over time. She's better in the Chiyuri one, a few years on we can assume.</br></br>  <br>They aren't the same. The only thing they have is same faces and somewhat similar hair.</br>  <br>Gain info from smug.</br>  <br><br>No, their personalities don't match.</br></br>  <br>I hope he reuses all his designs.</br>  <br> rape with a condom <br>...Huh.</br></br>  <br>Gotta dispose the evidence after all...</br>  <br>It's just so unusual to see in 2D porn.</br>  <br>I love the way Misuzu tilt her head 5° before talking to Tomo</br>  <br>You're causing her enough trouble anyway, might as well not cause anymore.</br>  <br><br>What a thoughtful rapist</br></br>   Good at othello <br> Not a chess <br><br>She is not a westerner</br></br></br>  <br>And your family<br><br>It is--the exposition is still part of the story. It doesn't matter that the bad things are over, they still happened. They don't just magically disappear, as made obvious by her mental state.<br><br>I think it's supposed to take place after all that, isn't it? Regardless, I'm not saying it's a BAD END or anything, but it's certainly far from happy. Silver linings are specifically used to denote the ironically positive outcomes of otherwise negative situations. The silver lining here is that she's getting better and her brother loves her, despite being kidnapped and drugged-up rape toy. Is the situation still "negative"? Maybe not, but the existence of the silver lining context itself implies things are not all well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> And your family <br><br>Before or after the wreck?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yes </br></br>  <br> It is--the exposition is still part of the story. It doesn't matter that the bad things are over, they still happened. They don't just magically disappear, as made obvious by her mental state. <br><br>Stories about positive things happening to people who've had bad things happen to them before are still stories about positive things. <br><br> Maybe not, but the existence of the silver lining context itself implies things are not all well. <br>You're the only one calling it a silver lining.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is that the same Mayu?</br>  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>Did you break out a fucking protractor?</br>  <br>I think by this point we've all seen enough Shaft tilts to gauge degrees by sight</br>  <br>So before. That's nice I guess.</br>  <br>Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken is webcomic that got anime.</br>  <br>But does Tomo-chan have any themes that the government wants to push on lonely otakus?</br>  <br>Exercise so you can get to Tomo-chan's level?</br>  <br> right gets vanilla dickings <br> left is mindbroken then gets vanilla dickings <br> middle is straight up raped <br>why?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullies get their comeuppance.<br><br>By being cummed-up in.</br></br></br>  <br>Middle gets pretty polite rape, though. They drug her without her knowing and use a condom and everything. Mayu had it the worst for sure.</br>  <br> polite rape <br>now, I know where we are, but...</br></br>  <br>Be polite, THEN rape?</br>  <br>As far as she knows, she goes to sleep, wakes up, and continues with her day.</br>  <br>on 2D perception, it look like 5. But i think in real life, her head probably tilt more than that. I would say 10 to 15</br>  <br>I mean they could hold her down and rape her but instead shes not conscious.<br><br>Thats a good amount of consideration.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean, I've been called out here for being naive before, but this is some next level asocial shit right here.</br></br>  <br><br>bruhs</br></br>  <br>Yes, congratulations, something in hentai has different standards than real life and you disagree with it. Would you also like to argue the morality behind loli? Maybe reason that tentacles make no biological sense?</br>  <br>I can't remember if she was a virgin, but if she wasn't, they basically didn't affect her life in any way except use up an hour of her time.</br>  <br>Look anon someone can rob you by stabbing you then taking your wallet or just take your wallet.<br><br>Which one is more polite?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's the "tree falls in the forest" argument. the problem is that you're overlapping 2D and 3D a bit too much, so just be careful.</br></br>  So how about that update? <br><br>Does not wearing a sports bra make Cotton Candy a slut?</br></br>  <br>That its northwest mexican tier robbing, What i think you meant to say is that someone stabs you then calls for a ambulance.</br>  <br>If it were in 3D, I honestly might have a similar opinion. I'd still have it illegal, of course, because "it's legal as long as the victim doesn't find out" is a horrible policy and would never work as intended, but I wouldn't care that much about the act itself.</br>  <br>Yes, that's why I don't mind my wife NTRing me so long she never gets STDs, gets pregnant and if I never find out since technically speaking it is as good as a none-existent issue :^).</br>  <br>So, the spats are her underwear and every can see her underwear all the time?</br>  <br>in the same way short shorts are underwear.</br>  <br>Tomo is way to shy for that.</br>  <br> polite rape <br><br>Well against all odds, I think that may be a new one.<br><br>I'd like to politely murder someone, how would I go about that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You neatly give them a peaceful, painless death &amp; an honourable burial afterwards,</br>  <br>The problem with NTR is the emotional betrayal - if my wife was raised in some commune and no one ever mentioned the concept of a single sexual partner to her before I caught her NTRing me, I wouldn't care, whereas I would care if someone who had never been taught that rape was wrong was raping someone. So since it's the willingness to NTR that's the betrayal, I don't think the lack of knowledge changes anything.<br><br><br>Drug them and then off them quickly and painlessly, or else give them forewarning and time to prepare shit, I don't know which.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same way Japanese characters do it from time to time, "Can you please let me kill you?"</br>  <br>Never heard of euthanasia?</br>  I'd like her to jump my rope.  <br>I'd grab her mounds of cotton candy anytime.</br>  <br>Very causal.</br>  <br><br>Swap incoming.

She just a weird kid.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say within the next two episodes.</br>  <br> “After finding that paternal age, maternal age and parental-age gaps all influence autism risk independently, we calculated which aspect was most important,” Dr. Sandin adds. “It turned out to be parental age, though age gaps also contribute significantly.” <br><br>  Autism rates were 66 percent higher among children born to dads over 50 years of age than among those born to dads in their 20s. Autism rates were 28 percent higher when dads were in their 40s versus 20s. <br><br>  Autism rates were 15 percent higher in children born to mothers in their 40s, compared to those born to moms in their 20s <br><br> Autism rates rose still higher when both parents were older, in line with what one would expect if each parent’s age contributed to risk. <br><br> Autism rates also rose with widening gaps between two parents’ ages. These rates were highest when dads were between 35 and 44 years old and their partners were 10 or more years younger. Conversely, rates rose when moms were in their 30s and their partners were 10 or more years younger. <br><br>https://www.autismspeaks.org/scienc<wbr>e/science-news/large-study-parent-a<wbr>ge-autism-finds-increased-risk-teen<wbr>-moms<br><br>Also: Renge does like all the things in that image too, it's past the point of being a meme.

After a day full of hand holding and clean fun, I'd take her home and cook her a delicious dinner full of her favorite foods. During bathtime, I'd help clean her back and dry her with the warmest, fuzziest towel I could find. At night, I'd tell her a tale full of adventure and mystery and her eyes would widen in innocent repose. <br><br>Once it was time to go to sleep, I'd cuddle with her under the blankets, hugging her tiny body close to mine. As she begins to drift off, I'd nip her ear and run my tongue down her soft, supple neck. She'd startle a little and sleepily ask what I was doing, but I'd simply shush her soothingly as I begin to grind against her. She'd enjoy the rocking motion of my hips and drowsily respond in similar fashion while I delicately kiss her nape. <br><br>My hands would begin to rub her body, tender but firm, until finally slipping gingerly between her legs. She would moan softly and the motion of her petite hips would increase, marginally at first but with increasing frequency to match my fingers. As she begins to pant, I'd start to feel a faint warmth oozing through both panties and pajamas. <br><br>I'd caress her hair and whisper, "would you like to feel better Ren-chon?" <br><br>She'd nod blushingly; a dainty sound of approval would escape her lips. <br><br>I'd roll her over until her smooth butt was sticking straight up, and delicately pull her underwear down to her knees. She'd be surprised at first, but I'd comfort her gently before tasting the dirtiest parts of her adorable body. She'd begin to loosen up quickly, her delicious juices dribbling down the inside of her thighs, and soft sighs of ecstasy would fill my ears. <br><br>Suddenly, in one fluid motion, I'd drag my tongue up her butt and back, leaving a trail of shivers and goosebumps. Hovering over her warm quivering body, I'd tenderly plunge myself inside her; a small "nyanpasu...!" escapes her lips.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would just like to let you know that you are under arrest and should report to your closest police station immediately. Thank you.</br>  <br>I always disliked this pasta.</br>  <br>Yeah, loli or not, licking the ass is disgusting.</br>  Nii-chan...  7  <br> Tumblr invasion is real. <br> ironically using a tumblr gif  <br>I don't even.</br></br></br>  <br>Except it's not.</br>  <br>Not again.</br>  <br>I'm not against creature sexualization. I stand against the sexualization of biyoris. There's a huge difference.</br>  <br>not even close.</br>  <br>Good job anon.</br>    <br>Help, Hotarun turned me into a pedophile.</br>  <br>Renge is annoying and creepy.</br>  <br>Seriously? Why do you think that? She's a lot like Mari from YuruYuri except she doesn't smile as much. She's still dynamic and friendly.</br>  <br>It's okay if it's Hotaru right?<br><br><br>The way she talks and the fact that she never laugh makes her annoying and creepy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She looks 17+ so it's not pedo</br>  <br>Ah, you're that autistic pseudo-elitist shitposter from S1.

It has plot,action, betrayal, saints, best girls, bunny.<br><br><br>Why aren't you watching the anime of our generation?Why...?</br></br></br>  That bunny deserves to be raped.  i dropped it in the latest episode because of cuck knight and "let's try to kill each other because MISUNDERSTANDINGS"  <br>It has a bad budget.</br>  <br>She's delicious though.</br>  <br>Why has IRC latched onto this show? Is the LN popular or something?</br>  <br>I'm not going to lie I'm just watching this for Bunny thighs, I don't even know the name of half the cast nor the plot, I just want delicious Bunny meat, maybe I'll bother watching it seriously when the last episode will air.</br>  <br>no, no misunderstandings.  bullet-chan really has been going around killing heroes who she thinks might get "chosen" </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128371455 <br>This.<br><br>I don't like where all that is going. <br>It's a shame because The Strongest Man Alive™ and Bunny really seemed to have hit it off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck<br><br>maybe i'll undrop it</br></br></br>  I haven't watched the anime but the MC in the LN was pretty much Naruto so I dropped it.  <br>IRC been such a wimp these days they can't even target shows properly.</br>  <br>That wascally wabbit is playing him.</br>  <br>Everyday until bunny stop fucking her dog?</br>  <br>There's only one good thing about this show</br>  <br><br>yes. and god is good. or at least doesn't have shit taset.</br></br>  <br>Vol 5.

I like the mayan/aztec influence.<br>MC is not a complete faggot or dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a qt.</br>  <br>What did she sold herself for?</br>  is there any other recentish anime that actually has a party going on an adventure <br><br>everything today is always this fucking rpg inspired shit where they say game terms in dialogue and just hang around a town the whole series</br></br>  <br><br>You must be devastated when the first girl to show up doesn't end up with the MC.<br><br>Have you almost recovered from Naruto?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Political aid from prince of different country</br>  <br> Fat dog dick. </br>  <br>hunter x hunter</br>  <br>OKish prince or faceless fat oldman tier prince?</br>  So this isn't haremshit and the MC gets with the chunni gun girl?  <br> You must be devastated when the first girl to show up doesn't end up with the MC. <br>Not usually, no. I just liked the bunny gal, that's all.<br> Have you almost recovered from Naruto? <br> Watching Naruto  <br> Sakura a shit. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the show still hasn't really settled into any recognizable pattern, i still don't know what this show is about. maybe it'll become a harem? maybe it's about fighting lots of monsters every episode?<br><br>well it's based off an LN so i'm sure others know</br></br></br>  <br>chaika</br>  <br><br>No harem at all, MC sticks with chuuni gunny and not the bunny. That's probably why the anime won't sell.</br></br>  the only good thing about this anime is the way characters fight, everything else is generic stuff we see almost every season  <br>i highly doubt there will be a harem considering the black knight is in love with bunny</br>    <br> MC sticks with chuuni gunny and not the bunny <br>Picked up</br></br>  <br><br>Oh boy, she's fucking delicious.<br><br>Picked up.</br></br></br></br>  Show is bad. It felt like a chore to watch the first episode    <br>Nice OVAs.</br>  <br>Chaos Dragon.<br><br> OH WAIT </br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure, whatever. But to call it cuck? You must be delusional.</br></br>  Someone spoil me the whole thing already  let me get this straight bunnies a whore?  <br>That bunny girl is built for repopulating the Earth after any and every mass extinction.</br>  <br>Bunny has the strongest libido and lowest willpower</br>  <br>So yuri bunnies a pure?

The final seal requires the lives of all the chosen ones?   If MC would drop the fucking Strongest Man in the World shit, I would enjoy this anime alot more, but I want to punch him everytime he says it.  <br><br>so the bunny doesn't sleep around shes just a lair?</br></br>  <br>A lair for what?<br> Worms? </br></br>  <br> those thighs <br>Delicious. Also,<br><br> silver-haired girl <br> voiced by Yuuki Aoi <br> is a love interest and according to LN the main one <br>Subarashii</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for bunny girl and now flower girl too.</br>  <br>His crap isn't even the focus of the damn show, you autistic fool. He does it to bait other warriors and draw attention to himself, the audience isn't suppose to be baited themselves.</br>  <br>woops meant to say liar<br><br>my question still stands though<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  How many volumes do you think the anime will cover, LNfags?  <br>MC is still cancer though</br>  <br>At this rate, one</br>  No bunny love?  <br>That's fair considering there's a good chance she was directly responsible for said mass extinction.</br>  Where does the "she takes the knot" thing come from, anyway?  <br>bunny doesn't give a shit about mc. she's using him.</br>  <br> The CQC and distraction being an attention whore <br>Seems like he is doing his job perfectly, you expect a kuudere to fit that role?<br><br> Loving traitors of mankind </br></br></br></br>  I just finished reading the first volume and oh SHIT!

Guess I'll be following it.</br>  <br> I really never understood why the other heroes believed him about all the stuff he was saying about the heat and the mist; he basically explained it all and then went "well, I know science, so just trust me on this one, guys" and they all went along with it even though they're all out for his blood and it's known that he's extremely cunning. </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I wish that Nips get a taste and this, or even just the source material, will sell well  <br> confirmed not a virgin for her ambitions and she is the traitor <br>Oh wait, this reminds of someone. Yeah that's totally not the main heroine from the author's previous work.</br></br>  The design of the 2 new chars really marked a new low in this series.  <br>Just wait until you meet Rolonia</br>  <br>Why Big bad always comes again, what is that thing?</br>  Would have been way more happy with this show if it was just Aztec Batman fucking shit up improv style.    <br>I guess you will like Mora</br>  <br>I was severely disappointed that we didn't even get any mesoamerican lore/mythology/mysticism up in this shit. Fucking blueballed when I realized it was just an anime original idea to add that 'theme'. No wonder I felt it was underutilized as fuck.</br>  <br>Yeah that was super disappointing, it was so promising.</br>  <br>At this point I expect the plot to go absolutely nowhere.</br>  <br>Just caught up and I'm loving it, I'm getting Legend of the Legendary Heroes vibes from it with the character interactions and adventures, I'll probably read the LN after the anime finishes airing.<br><br>Fremy is the best girl.</br></br></br>  is this another Gary Stu anime?  <br>Yeah because the other heroes are brainless as a tard that's why   except Hans  </br>  <br>Yes, Adlet is the strongest man in the world.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128381111 <br> brutal rape <br> not wanting hours of sweet pure love making <br> not wanting to nestle your head inbetween those fantastic breasts while she hugs you afterwards <br>honestly I think both our points are valid</br></br></br></br>  <br>[spolier] Fremy is the main girl? [/spoiler]</br>  <br>HAHA NOOB!</br>  <br>What?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128381111 <br>Nothing, that's perfectly normal.</br>  I AM THE BONE OF MY SWORD  <br>Red herring.</br>  <br>This is legit.</br>    Adlet is the second 7th hero confirmed in vol 5. Tgerneu brainwashed him into falling in love with Fremy    <br>UNLIMITED BLADE WORKSS!!!!</br>   tfw you'll never be the strongest man in the world  <br><br>;_;<br><br>rest of volume 4 translated when, I hate hearing these vol5 spoilers and not being able to read about it</br></br></br></br>  adlet is the red man  <br>Rabbit is the man in red.</br>  fremy is the traitor  <br> not Fremy </br>  <br> It is literally proof of God existence. <br><br>Not too sure about the anime, but those thights and them hips, oh, that's for fucking sure!</br></br></br>   like bunnys design the most <br>   she's the bad guy <br><br>Why is life cruel</br></br></br>  Bunny girl being crazy doesn't surprise me. The one person I hated the most is the gun girl. Fuck her. The cat boy is the best character besides the MC.  Mora is best grill. I would gladly spend all day in bed with her and her daughter  cuddling.   <br>Just caught up with it. I like it. Also more Aoi Yuuki is always good for my heart.</br>  <br>Actually, bunny being a traitor and non-virgin makes me harder than diamond. Since I was already diamond before. It's definitely better than vanilla harem love interest #12456723123. <br><br>I need source on those claims though. I saw some anons arguing otherwise. Will they reach that point in th anime?</br></br></br>  <br>Fffffffuuuuuuuuuuck me</br>  I watched the first two episodes, but the bunny girl reallu fucking pisses me off  Who eats lemons like that!?  <br>You don't?</br>  <br>Why would I?</br>  <br>Clearly because cute girls eat them that way.<br>You're a cute girl, aren't you?</br></br>  <br>Sure anon.</br>  <br>Speeddraw is the girl for me.</br>    <br>It's pretty great, but so far Gakkou Gurashi seems like it'll be AOTS.</br>    Does anyone here think that clavage bunny isn't the traitor? the opening practically spells it out for us and her ultra sad backstory in episode 2 pretty much confirmed it  <br>No, because I've read the novels.</br>  <br>Boob strap is underrated clothing.</br>  <br>Why is she a bunny. I dont understand. theres no other halfbreeds in the show.</br>  <br>Reading is for nerds.</br>  <br>She's not actually a bunny. The rabbit ears are part of her helmet.</br>  <br>don't spoil me, but I don't believe you</br>  <br>heh</br>  <br> Self proclaimed strongest in the world <br><br>Kek. He is more like Batman than Superman.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, the lovemaking would come after that, I don't actually like hurting people. Just that for some reason, when I see that bunny, I turn into a wolf.<br><br><br>I hope bunny learned to shake her ass like an educated prostitute, I want to see it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strongest Man in the World is the 7th.<br>He doesn't know he is. But he is.</br></br>  <br> Adlet is the second 7th hero confirmed in vol 5 <br> Tgerneu brainwashed him into falling in love with Fremy <br>This is just as convoluted as Bantorra was. And considering how much of a trainwreck Bantorra's finale was, you can expect this to end like a complete clusterfuck.</br></br></br>  Phlegmy a SHIT!<br>Bunny Princess is the best Yuusha.<br>Swords &gt; Guns<br>All undeniable facts.</br></br></br>  <br> Actually, bunny being a traitor and non-virgin makes me harder than diamond <br>You need to watch/read The Book of Bantorra then.</br></br>  So, what makes this show good? Bare in mind, I can fap to any number of doujins that will be produced if all it has going for it is usagiko.  <br> backgrounds <br> Aztec theme <br> boobs </br></br></br>  <br>Fremy is a trenchcoat wearing, ugly and edgy shit.</br>  <br>The series is a mystery case in disguise. Everyone is so anal about figuring out who the seventh is pretty much the plot.</br>  Reminder, MC is a self jerking faggot and the only redeemable aspects of the show is the cool setting and the curves on the bunny.  <br>It's mediocre, not good.</br>  <br>wtf is going on with her eyes?</br>  <br>why?</br>   mfw Nashetania is actually Nashandra   <br>Because she's trenchcoat wearing, gun wielding, edgemistress.</br>  <br>This is fake.</br>  <br>LIFE ON THE PLANET</br>  <br> &gt;Stupid ass flower on her head <br> &gt;I-IM EDGY AND QUIET AND I FELL FOR MC OC!! </br></br>  <br>Shw singlehandedly almost ruin the whole show for me. Being all mysterious isn't going to stop you from getting killed.</br>  <br>I don't watch LN garbage.</br>  <br>The first two girls already like MC the first day they meet him. It's going to be a harem.</br>  <br>Traitors and whores do</br>  <br>Yeah her episode is a low point of the show.</br>  <br>You fucking wish.</br>  <br>But anon, that's not bunny girl.</br>  <br> bunny <br> actually liking the MC <br>She's playing you all for fools.</br></br></br>  <br> bunny ears for no reason <br>It's shit</br></br>  <br>How about bunny girl want the monster and humans to get along for no reason.</br>  <br>Watch-- The next bitch to show up is going to want his dick too of course. He's the MC after all.</br>  <br>Fuck off fremyfag.</br>  <br>Would be a good plot twist for once.</br>  <br>Mora has a husband and Chamo hates everyone but kittyman, the Rabbit doesn't care. Read the fucking books.</br>  <br>There's quite a bit more to her character that isn't revealed until later. She's not being edgy just because she can be. <br><br><br>None of the heroes are good people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whip-chan doesn't dislike MC.</br>  <br>Why does she need bunny ears for that?</br>  <br> rolonia <br> not a good person </br></br>  <br>  for no reason. <br><br>Oh there's a reason. It's stupid but there IS a reason.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll hold judgement until I get her backstory. She's good at laundry though I'll give you that.</br>   start reading the LN <br> prologue is Nashetania chasing Adlet and trying to kill him <br>Why the fuck didn't they adapt that?</br></br>  <br>Bunny wants to suck fiend cocks, that's why</br>  <br>She's half human and half monster with a monster mother. Something about failing to kill a little girl. Get attacked by her mother. Then she suddenly spouts that they would kill each other even after getting the crest.</br>  <br>Because then we'd get another Tokyo ESP situation where people wonder what the fuck is going on.</br>  <br>But anon, she's the only one who didn't want to genocide the brainwashed human army in the woods</br>  <br> Then she suddenly spouts that they would kill each other even after getting the crest. <br>How isn't that logical, you idiot? She's been killing heroes since the start and just because she got the crest she'd go back to her target that she failed to kill and the others and say "We're all friends now" and magically everyone would forgive her? It's a logical assumption.</br></br>   WHY IS ADLET THE SECOND 7TH   <br> WHY DOES THE POPE SHIT IN THE WOODS </br>  <br>Based on that after that she actually told her story and people do feel sad for her. Yes. And didn't Adlwt say something that the she wouldn't be chosen without a reason. So, they would definitely accept her.</br>  <br>Given her backstory and her being betrayed by everyone, even her own mother, do you really think that would be the conclusion she'd reach at that point in time? Assuming that they would try to kill her on the spot makes the most sense.</br>  <br>She had been betrayed by fiends not humans. Especially not one of the six. Her line of thinking is really edgy.</br>  <br>Still best girl.</br>  <br> This is the only anime in the Anime of the season competition. <br>But that's Non Non Biyori, anon.</br></br>  <br>No, her line of thinking is based on her own experiences. Looking at it from an outside perspective is nice and all, but it means jack shit. <br> Especially not one of the six. <br>If I was in her shoes, I wouldn't go anywhere near the crazy little girl that I failed to kill, who also I'm scared shitless of and has a grudge against me.</br></br></br>  <br>I've noticed there's been an uptick in bunny girl popularity lately, kind of out of nowhere</br>  <br>Go to the others and not the fucking little girl. If she is a six, people will defend her.<br>It's not only that but the whole way that she act. She is edgy.</br></br>  <br>Also, I forgot, you can say she's edgy by ignorance. That kind of edgy is perfectly fine and justifiable by me. Also /a/ calls edgy everyone and their mother these days, so the term has lost its relevance.</br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> If she is a six, people will defend her. <br>Again, it's perfectly fine to assume that if you have a general trust in people. How the fuck is she supposed to have that?<br/></br></br>  It's actually silly how competent Adlet is compared to the entire party<br><br>If he truly wanted he could probably kill at least half of them</br></br>  <br>Still best girl.</br>  <br>Adlet is the only one outside of Kittyman that has a brain.</br>  <br>Almost the whole thing was spent on the opening, outsourcing to Telecom is not cheap.<br><br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>yhecm</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>By living with the humans. <br>Ignorance my ass. Ignorant people wouldn't be edgy.</br></br>  Adlet is cool. <br>I really like episode 2 where Fremy tells him to fuck off and she runs away, he shakes his head, and then throws a smoke grenade at her.</br>   So is Adlet going to be the one who kills Bunny down the line?<br/>   <br>Would you expect anything less from  THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD ?<br><br><br> By living with the humans.  <br>Oh right, I forget her doing that. Probably because she hasn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> edgy <br>Fuck off with your shitty meme.</br></br>  <br>She stayed in a village. Of course she kind of lives with them.</br>  <br>She lived in a Kyoma village and regularly went out to hunt humans.</br>  <br>She was raised with the Kyoma. If you mean, living in a village for a short while afterwards, before the story starts, and you're trying to use that as a reason for her trusting humans then I can only assume that you don't have the slightest fucking clue about how human emotions and psychology work. <br><br>Someone would reply with "where do you think we are", but still jesus christ /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>She will love him and she will like it. No buts.</br>  why dont they just befriend the seventh and defeat the majin together?  <br>to promote equality</br>  Revolution soon, fellow comrades.  Reira acute  Claiming thread in name of Ruri.

They were really going all over the place with her.</br>  <br>She just broke his bloody arm</br>  I know that the card is banned in the OCG. But I still have this feeling that Tuning Magician won't surpass Glow-Up Bulp in Magicians. <br><br>Here is hoping for Tuning Magician to be useful though. And perhaps  transform into a pendulum. </br></br>  <br> Glad Pixiv has settled on Selena x Sawatari. <br><br>She barely has any fanart with him.</br></br></br>  <br>Pixiv hasn't settled on jack shit.</br>  <br>Why is Glow-Up Bulb still banned in OCG</br>  <br/>  <br>Yuri and Serena doing cute evil things when?</br>  <br>We've got Yuya's DMG now where is his Kuriboh.</br>  The Kingu remains supreme and as always Yugi/Atem are still manlets.  <br>Because it's such a low level monster with such a low ATK that it's an insult to the game itself and suits filthy commons perfectly.</br>  <br>They best get on it, Sawatari/Serena is the only thing that makes sense. <br><br>So far she's the only one that he's relatively listened to when she told him to calm down and they seemed to not dislike each other while they went on their dueling and food adventure.</br></br></br>  <br>Sawatari, you need to control your delusions already.</br>  <br>It honestly makes me laugh seeing Atem get smaller and smaller in these things.</br>    <br>Don't hate me, I'm just trying to entertain you guys.</br>  <br>Delete this</br>  <br>Well he is the King of Manlets.</br>  <br>Knowing Yuya, this is exactly what will happen.</br>  <br><br>Gotta give her a little magician hat and wand first.</br></br>  <br>what the fuck is their coat made of ?</br>  <br>The power of their burning souls causes the wind to blow.</br>  <br>I always forget Kaito is 18 years old</br>  <br><br>Even Yusei and Yuya's coats are like that</br></br>  <br>That's Serena, not Yuzu. Get your eyes checked Yuya.</br>  <br> Kaito is 18 <br> Still a manlet <br>god damn</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuga Xyz genes.</br>  <br>Yandere Yuya when?</br>  <br>Shun is pretty tall though.</br>  <br><br> He never ranku-upu </br></br>  <br>It'd be nice to see Yuri in a standard Academia uniform. Albeit a purple one.</br>  <br>Yusei has a burning soul for Stardust and his bike, Yuya for Yuzu and entertainment.</br>  <br>It's anime, so you gotta remember height is weird. He's probably only like 5'7" like Yusei.</br>  <br>That would mean the Yus are fucking midgets.</br>  Anyone playing with Greydles?<br><br>Are they as ayylmao as everyone says they are?</br></br>   Yuya is probably listening to Bonnie Tyler's total eclipse of the heart and Scorpions still loving you in his hotel room while clutching a picture of Yuzu in the fetal position while he cries   <br>Remind me, Kaito is the Galaxy-Eyes faggot, right?</br>  <br>When did Yuya become Shun?</br>  <br>They're like 5'3", so yeah they kind of are. Shun is probably somewhere in between Jonouchi and Kaiba though honestly.</br>  <br>Shun is probably busy listening to push it to the limit while he has flashbacks to Heartland, Yuto, and Ruri, that's probably what was going through his head during his duels with Sora, push it to the limit.</br>  <br> Shun is probably somewhere in between Jonouchi and Kaiba though honestly. <br>If he is the same age as Yuto and Yuto is the same age as Yuya then Shun is pretty high for a 14 year old</br></br>  <br>Shun is probably listening to Braving! and Challenge The Game.</br>  <br> Shun has Fusion genes <br> Sora has Xyz genes <br> Perfect explanation for why Sora is a manlet and the true reason why he liked Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon <br> Also explains why Shun cards people the way Academia does and why he trusts Serena even if she was from Academia. Even if she is a Ruri, she is the Fusion Ruri and should be considered worst girl in his mind.   Even though Serena is ARC-V's best girl. <br><br><br> Purple <br> Purple = Fusion <br> Armityle the Chaos Phantom is a Fusion Monster <br> Armityle is the combination of Uria (Slifer Red), Hamon (Ra Yellow) and Raviel (Obelisk Blue) <br><br>yfw Yuri (or Leo) has a Fusion whose appearance or effect is as retardedly bad as Armityle. The boss monster which was somehow inferior to the three monsters needed to make it. Especially when you look at the TCG/OCG Armityle.<br><br>At least the anime version of Armityle had this weird effect of giving itself to the opponent, then banishing every card on your opponent's field except itself, and then it returns to your field.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuri's ace is probably Something Something Fusion Dragon, so it'd be safe to assume that the retardedly-bad-effect fusion monster belongs to Leo.  And to the entity that arises when the Yuyas finish eating each other .</br>  <br>Here ya go, everybody pretty much matched up, Kaiba/Jack obviously too tall to be shown.</br>  <br>The first word in the name has to be Violet.</br>  <br>been testing with it.<br>definitely broken as shit, main weakness is majespecters.</br></br>  <br>The space cancer kind of stunted his growth.<br><br>Reminder Haruto is 13 yet looks 8.</br></br></br>  <br>Shun is most likely Reiji’s age which is 16.</br>  <br>That little fuck is the same age as Yuya and all his friends?<br><br>Fucking what</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya is 14, but yeah, poor Haruto.</br>  <br>That would make Shun/Ruri twins if they were the same age. Shun is probably older, he's either 15, just before the cutoff of the Junior Youth, or 16, and Reiji was just like fuck it, Junior Youth for you instead of youth faggot.</br>  <br>I meant Yuma</br>  <br>Are you serious?<br>Holyshit</br></br>  Enmaryuuoh Red Daemon Calamity / Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity<br>Dark Dragon / Synchro / Effect<br>LV12 4000/3500<br>2 Tuners + 1 non-Tuner DARK Dragon-Type Synchro Monster<br>(1) When this card is Synchro Summoned: You can activate this effect; during this turn, your opponent cannot activate card effects from their field. Your opponent cannot activate effects in response to this effect’s activation. (2) If this card destroys an opponent’s monster by battle: Inflict damage to your opponent equal to that monster’s original ATK. (3) If this card is destroyed by your opponent: You can target 1 Level 8 or lower DARK Dragon-Type Synchro Monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon that monster. <br><br>Kinda eh.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Still goes down like a prom date in front of Castel ;) <br>Konami please.

Your opponent cannot activate effects in response to this effect’s activation. <br>So can you chain Quasars effect to negate?</br></br>  <br> just not on the turn its summoned <br>Lets be real here, 9/10 times this card isnt going to make it through your opponent turn</br></br>  <br> Your opponent cannot activate effects in response to this effect’s activation. <br>No because it doesn't start a chain. Only way to stop it is to negate the summon.</br></br>  <br>So Solemn Warning/Rai-Oh/Stardust Warrior?</br>  <br>Reminds me of some boss from some Final Fantasy game</br>  <br> 2 tuners <br>  weak negation  <br> 4000 atk instead of 4500 or 5000 <br><br>above all else the two tuner requirement is what kills it. Poor synchros, they will never ever beat Xyz.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Space cancer pretty much froze their ages at 14 and 8.

Thus making your world 4 times bigger and quadrupling resources instead of dividing them.</br></br>  <br>To rule them, of course.<br>Easier to rule dimensions if you only have to pay attention to one.</br></br>  <br>Can't manage 4 different dimensions<br><br>Better to combine all four worlds and govern one single body instead of going through the hassle of keeping track of all the shit and gossip and politics and teenage trends like playing cards while riding skateboards in four different dimensions</br></br></br>  <br> Wanting to rule an overpopulated world. <br><br>Enjoy famine and misery in your kingdom.</br></br></br>  <br>Fusion dimension logic, they think anything fused is better</br>  <br><br>So like since all the cities overlap, where would the people who lived in Synchro, XYZ and Fusion live when they enter Standard?<br><br>Will Leo just be like dunno lel I rule now thx bai?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The cities and various locations are obviously going to position themselves where they don't overlap, probably through some bullshit Spell Card Leo uses. <br><br>If the theory is true that each dimension was originally all together into one single dimension, they'll go back to how they were</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't the earth be 3 times bigger thanks to fusing the dimensions?</br>  <br>No. you're just overlapping them, you're not placing them side by side.<br><br>Currently the world is 3 times bigger because it's not fucking just 1 dimension.</br></br></br>  <br>that's how villains work!</br>  <br>There's no way the world separated while all these cities existed or the people would be like where the fuck did that city go?<br><br>People would easily believe that there are other dimensions if you state you come from a city that used to exist but vanished in thin air some time ago.</br></br></br>  <br> Not believing in Yusho magic <br><br>It'll all be explained when he appears, crazy bastard</br></br></br>  <br>Yusho is drunk in a bar somewhere neglecting his son and wife.</br>  Dueling while skydiving or kitesurfing when?  <br>Way ahead of you<br><br> While this card is face-up on the field, all players must Duel while skydiving. </br></br></br>  <br>Loser's parachute doesn't open.<br><br>The deadliest dueling!</br></br></br>  <br>But that doesn't send you to the shadow realm!</br>  <br><br> tfw 2 or more of your draws/edits in a thread <br>hey guys what can i do for you today</br></br></br>  <br>We need Shun fighting 10 men in the prison showers.</br>  <br> Stardust Warrior? <br>My nigga.</br></br>  <br>Draw Shun and Ruri watching birds.</br>  You'd think people living in a world of card game strategies would be able to think of a counter to the security deck by now. It's fucking the same for each one of them, just think of a counter and they can never stop you.    <br>Fusion fags only know how to go minus</br>  <br>To be fair, those counters could be out of their reach since it's half implied that commons is in the same bind as the slums in 5D, trash cards everywhere.
