[ Something is happening. I can feel my face rebuilding itself. My eyes are growing larger, finally able to see the world for what it is. And my chin is now a sharp point. Like a blade. The hair on my head is excited. It's standing up proud and defiant, like a flame atop my skull. I can feel dormant muscles coming to life, as if summoned by some unknown force.<br>I am turning into an anime right now. This has been an ongoing evolution. From the first frame of Momotaro's Devine Sea Warriors to my transformation, it is all part of some great plan. I don't think this world will be able to contain me. What if I become too powerful? I imagine that if Akira Toriyama saw me right now, he would faint, believing one of his own creations to have jumped off the page.</br>  That's totally Superman's crest on his chest.  Anon, can you just be human?  <br>I don't care what anyone says<br><br>Halo Legends was alright</br></br></br>  <br>It certainly was, had it's ups and downs for sure, but it was overall pretty enjoyable.</br>  <br>i think this was my personal favorite from the episodes</br>  Crap I gotta get around to finally watching this  Iconic anime scenes  <br>What part you didn't understand post something relevant and iconic for anime in general not for you shit</br>   ctrl + f <br> Gunbuster <br> no results <br><br>Are you all even trying?</br></br></br></br>  <br> dbz in the original post </br>    <br>That feel when we got all the good digimons with the original soundtrack and with a supperb dub and don't the shit USA try to call digimon till digimon xross wars but that was shit anyway so we are happy whit what we got</br>  Waiting for episode 1 edition.<br><br>So my dear turboplebians, there is some doubts and problems here:<br> Animeonlyfags shitting the threads incoming <br> Censorship or not censorship (white screens) <br> 12 or 24 episodes  <br><br>Can't wait for the best girl and her VA<br> RACHNEE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> blue <br>There's only one true blue for me.</br></br>  <br><br> So it's basically good guy scanlators trying to do shit in their free time vs. autistics weebs who piss and moan about quality but don't care enough to contribute themselves? <br><br>Yeah, pretty much.<br><br>Maybe I'm just more patient than others, but I'd rather have top-tier scanslations that are almost good enough to print and will always be that good in a week than have shit-tier scanslations in one day.<br><br>Hell, if I could get PrettyAnonymous/Blisswater translations of the manga printed in actual manga-volumes, I'd buy them in a heart-beat over the shitty Seven Seas translations.<br><br>I'm honestly thinking about writing Seven Seas and telling them they lost another customer's money because their translations are so shitty and intentionally stray from the artist's script in order to insert Reddit-humor and internet memes.<br><br>I really don't care what faggots on /a/ say: From what I've seen, the PrettyAnon team does fucking top-tier work, and their members that post in Monmusu-threads are based as fuck.<br><br>Makes me wish I could do something to thank them, because if it weren't for them I'd have no real way to have access to quality scanslations of my favorite manga.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127703035#p127715682">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only mermaid I like is that girl from LoL.</br>  <br><br> those eyes </br></br>  <br>Last release was May 19th(?). At the end of Chapter 35, Okayado announced "break till July 19th". Probably so he had more time to check/approve merchandise, as well as critiquing/overseeing some episodes.</br>  And so the battle commences. A thread's up  but it's in the 400s so I'll start a new one.<br><br>Boku no Hero Academia </br></br>  <br> Tax free </br>  <br>It's probably 美味ぇ</br>    why are there no fat chefs in totsuki<br><br>aldini doesn't count</br></br>  <br>I wonder when the series will revisit the notion of being an 'Asura,' and if Souma will follow this path.<br>I'm guessing Ryou is someone who most resembles this type of cooking since he's all about forcing people into submission, and a god of destruction (Asura) is I suppose about being merciless.</br></br>  First episode tomorrow. Let's keep this thread going till then.<br><br>Cautiously optimistic for Papa Bones.</br></br>  <br>It's edgy, but it does a good job of reasoning it. The denizens simply live in a dog eat dog world. The protagonist and his posse are mentally affected by their game settings.<br><br>Imagine some roleplayer in D&amp;D got transported into another world, and turned into his paper recorded character, right down to having the tendencies and good/evil alignment that was set up by him even if it goes against what he personally is like in the real world. But he also knows this, so there's conflict.<br><br>Well, his posse doesn't know it, because they are npcs and think it's natural.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The magic equivalent of Touch Me in the guild.</br>  So what's the radio show about?  Anyone know where exactly the drama cd fits in? seems like after 3 but before 4  <br>You mean the CD drama? If the anime doesn't cover it you'll wanna get it since it's side stories.</br>  Goodbye and good riddance to this Gaiden, it really soured toward the end. Hey, it's just like the original series!<br><br>It seems like the latest arc in Black Clover is ending. I'm going to give the series a few more chapters to get entertaining otherwise I'll be knocking it off the list until it does.<br><br>There's still no new series in the English magazine. I don't know if there WILL be at this point. If there is, I hope it's Straighten Up!, because apparently it's doing well right now and should probably last a decent while  Maybe it'll take another month or so for a new series to enter Viz Jump. I remember when Black Clover entered they did like two weeks of multiple chapter releases to catch up.<br><br>If you read Blue Exorcist/Ao no Exorcist, here is a DDL of chapter 69: http://www23.zippyshare.com/v/NtuB5<wbr>1C5/file.html<br>I don't know why you read this, but I won't judge you.

He just had the motivation and willpower to take charge and head to the Kage summit.</br>  <br>Who knows? Sarada sensed some weird shit between Ino and her dad.</br>  <br>No. I mean Danzo was Hiruzen's fault. That and Nurudu growing up the most hated person in the village. That was on him too.<br><br>And Orochimaru. That's also his fault. Itachi too.<br><br>And Nagato since Danzo was responsible for that shit.<br><br>Fuck Hiruzen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Tobirama really dropped the ball with that promotion.<br><br>I wonder why he never had Hiraishin marks at places like Minato did.<br><br>"Oh shit, we're trapped. Ok, I'm going to draw a mark on your ankle, and then a few seconds later you'll be in my office.
