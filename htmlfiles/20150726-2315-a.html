[ Read the guide before asking questions buyfag.moe  bump because principles and /a/ being full on gay    I'm actually glad most of the announcements have been boring.<br>Closed wallet season won't hurt.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Holy shit have I been broke past couple of weeks.</br></br></br>  The thing that got me hyped was the sakamoto figma. <br><br> I don't even like jointshit too </br></br>  Another bump because fuck fatties.  ded thred<br>ded wonfes</br>  <br>I dunno I'm pretty hype on account of GSC</br>  I don't understand why people post in Pochaco threads. It's like they see the "Buyfag thread" and the link to the guide and think "Oh, this must be the buyfag thread', and completely ignore the fact that it's a fucking Pochaco thread. Does /a/ even have any mods, how do those threads not get banned instantly?  Did they show off Celty's figma?  <br> Believe in Vomit Dog </br>  <br>Nope. Just the announcement picture.</br>  Mako nendoroid up on the GSC online shop.  Anyone have a picture of the GSC wall of figs, just woke up and missed everything else.    <br>http://whl4u.jp/wh22/exhibit/galler<wbr>y/</wbr></br>  <br><br> Nendoroid Hotaru and Nendoroid Yui. </br></br>    No new Rin figure? <br><br>Obviously they'd make a Saber one, but I really expected some new Rin stuff after UBW</br></br>  Stupid sexy Ricchan.  <br>So much meh. Should have made that a proper flexible cape somehow.</br>  <br>Okay then... I might buy my first figma.<br> fuck </br></br>      I'm not that into figurines and stuff but I saw this one... so beautiful.  <br>That's all kinda self explanatory then.</br>  <br> worst saenai <br> beautiful <br>Anon I got news for you.</br></br></br>  <br>Did mfc compile a list yet</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>At least it does not have a shitty face like the one you posted.</br>  Feria 【フェリア】 from Comet Lucifer 『コメット・ルシファー』.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/P57C-Io44dA  [ ]</br></br>  I'm glad I waited.  <br><br/></br>  Say something GSC  <br>the PV isn't telling me anything, but it sure looks pretty</br>  <br>Right, because having 1 figma and around 50 ordinary anime figures makes me a /tv/isionist.</br>  <br>She keeps getting stuff of her in alternative outfits, its really annoying. Is it just too much to ask for a scale in her regular clothes?</br>  <br>the part of your brain responsible for figmas goes there. the rest can stay .</br>  <br>I get the art style and all but this shit just looks lazy as fuck.</br>  <br>I'd rather get a lobotomy to remove that part.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>331765</wbr>  <br>I'm reserving judgement until I see the final product. If he looks like that when he's up for order I can't see him being over 3k, which would be something.</br>  <br>as you wish, onii-chan.</br>  I didn't have a lot of faith in this but it looks pretty good.  he better come with 4 arms and legs  <br>Everything else is good but the tiddy just looks so bad.</br>  <br><br>Myhipsaremovingontheirown</br></br>  <br>They look like two beach balls stapled to her chest.</br>  <br>R;N is dead and buried.</br>  <br> voiced by hashi <br>Will watch.</br></br>  Should have known GSC is gonna milk it dry  Time to take a nap before Wonfest 2nd broadcast happens. The figure talk portion.   no pochaco nendo <br><br>You had ONE JOB, GSC.</br></br>  What's wrong with  FREEing ?  <br>No one would buy a 12,000 jpy nendo of some hambeast</br>  <br> looking at her face <br>Are you gay? Serious question.</br></br>  <br> a ball with 4 other balls attached to it to represent tits and ass <br>Wow, it's fucking nothing  just like every porkchaco. </br></br>  <br> someone cares about something other than butts and boobies <br> they must be gay <br>When will this meme end?</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing if their bunny line is concerned, otherwise a little pricey. They're okay overall</br>  <br>When everyone in society is gay. So, pretty soon, maybe.</br>  <br>I'm fine with that instead of continuing it by beating a dead horse like S;G 0.</br>  <br>Their paintjobs are pretty flawed. I don't own any of their figures yet, but this WonFes made them my heroes. Three must-buys.</br>  <br> Nozomi's tail <br>errytime lmao</br></br>  <br>I see. Well, that's fine, no price whatsoever will keep me from my waifu,  not even fabric clothing. <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287872<br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287880</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I think you may be confused with figma R Ichirou.</br>  I see no one posted OSs Tsukiumi.  <br>No, he's not.</br>  <br>Looks shit.</br>  <br>Oh my, I missed him. This is nice too. But it's not a figma. It's by UC, so is it even an action figure?</br>  <br>That fedora.</br>  <br>He won't look like that once he's out. They have a bad record with realistic faces. But at least he comes with a helmet.</br>  <br>Vulcanlog is Union Creative's poseable line apparently.</br>  <br>I imagine that most people who buy him are just going to use the body for headswaps.</br>   summer wonfes 2015 <br>If you don't love boatshit, swordshit or idolshit, you're fucked.</br>  Next DickFes, right?  <br>This, at least we don't have shit taste brah</br>  <br><br>Cry more. The tears, they are delicious.</br></br>  <br><br>Satori and Koishi made it worth it.</br></br>  <br> summer wonfes 2015 <br>You mean every wonfes since 2013.</br></br>  <br>I see. I remember seeing an image for half of the Vulcanlog stuff, was wondering what that was. Not sure where UC is getting the money for these licenses when their figures look meh, but I'm glad they've been trying.</br>  <br>Congrats, you're at least the tenth person to post this exact comment.</br>  Shitfes.   nervousness intensifies   <br>Waiting for preorder, I've been into her since they shown the sculpt. Also getting , already preordered.<br><br>Jesus fuck, I'm afraid of the moment all those announcements hit preorders, it will be bad for my mental health. Already have 7 scales till the end of 2015 with average of 18kY per month each month. This is hell.</br></br></br>  Anyone got a good picture of the wall?  <br> you're fucked <br>At least my wallet is safe from Japan's horrid taste.</br></br>  <br>Well, Union Creative owns Revoltech and Kaiyodo, so they've got experience with poseables. I think Vulcanlog was originally made for Monster Hunter poseables, but they saw the profit figma was bringing in and widened their options.</br>  <br>Yeah, but I can't blame them, I don't barely watch anime anymore. The only figure I cared for this entire wonfes is a damn nendoroid.</br>  <br> no new chitoge <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off back to twitter and tumblr</br>  <br>I know, right, not a single Giganigga announced. Fucking anime killed all chances of getting more.</br>  <br>There were some figures that got me mildly interested. but nothing exciting.</br>  <br>It';s the anime that made them release it in the first place.</br>  <br>Not like you need, she has dozens. <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/searc<wbr>h.php?character_strict=1&amp;character_<wbr>id=42743</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, cry more.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, man, we could be getting more of those top-notch sins, pochaco and sonico figures, amirite?</br>  What are you going to spend your money on instead of figures since there was nothing good at Wonfes?  <br>Wow, then they're banking. I had thought Kaiyodo was the owner of Revoltech and owned themselves.</br>   not a single Shit la Shit figure <br>Damn, it sure feels good being right.</br>  <br>Books and their buttrape ship rates just like every year.</br>  <br> You had ONE JOB, GSC. <br>Yeah, their job is not to make nendos out of shity characters</br></br>  <br>Well, Kaiyodo technically owns Revoltech, but Union Creative owns Kaiyodo and is putting them to work on their new Vulcanlog line.</br>  How are you guys keeping up on Wonfes news? I was out for the last two days and wanna catch up on what's new.  <br>Guess I'm finally going to save up for a scalped Mark Sein</br>  <br> liking Shitoge <br>She has enough figures already faggot. If there were to be any more nisekoi shit i'd want Marika but the whole series would be better off just dying at this point.</br></br>  <br>Browse through all the threads. Check MFC for your favorite tags. Done.</br>  <br>Companies really fucked up with the anime related content, mainly because of idolshit. The only things I'm interested are fucking /v/ and /co/ related.</br>  <br>I just wanted a prototype this wonfes.</br>  <br><br><br> S2 just ended  <br> No Onodera figures  <br>Always Winter WonFes, right guys?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right about what? Even fans didn't expect any new figures this wonfes.</br>  <br> mainly because of idolshit <br>Was there really that much? There was way more boatshit  and I'm immensely sad I can't really afford them all. </br></br>  Is this a joke?<br><br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287732</wbr></br></br>  <br>My dick.</br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/<wbr>22995<br>Lurk more next time friend</br></wbr></br>  <br>It wasn't that different from past wonfeses, lots of announcements, maybe a few things that I will actually order. I was hoping to see Purple Heart's prototype the most this wonfes but a Sento scale by Alter is more than enough for me.</br>  <br>https://twitter.com/BadDragonNews/s<wbr>tatus/623669293847162880</wbr></br>  The love is alive and well.  I'm on the Shinkansen. <br><br>So, my report on this WonFes.<br><br>- Boatsluts everywhere<br>- That new tanned submarine loli got the spotlight<br>- Literally no Touhous. I have a sad<br>- More monster stands compared to last winter<br>- More generic figures selling stands compared to last winter<br>- Griffon only had a stand about Jurassic Park (?)<br>- Not many figures that were also being shown last winter<br>- Practically no Gakkou Gurashi besides 1 unpainted figure<br>- There was a Gakkou Gurashi show at 1:30 pm but I missed it ;_;<br>- Lots of Fate as usual</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh damn, I've actually been thinking about buying them</br>  <br><br>thx</br></br>  <br> hating chitoge <br><br>DUDE</br></br></br>  <br>They should at least give us rainbowslut</br>  <br><br>  - Literally no Touhous. I have a sad <br><br>I thought they got nendos?</br></br></br></br>  Somewhat relevant, but<br>Should I sculpt my own figure digitally then print it<br>Or get whatever material they use to sculpt and do it traditionally<br><br>What material is it even</br></br></br></br>  <br>He musn't have seen them.</br>  Did griffon not announce anything? I thought they had a booth there?  <br>I looked through the list on MFC and idols took up the entirety of two companies announcements. I didn't even notice many boats or Saber. I've been going through everything on my phone, though, so I could have easily spaced them out.</br>  <br><br>Spotted a couple of nendos. Still too few</br></br>  <br> thx <br>Motherfuck.</br></br>  <br>Actually the only must-buy for me is none of those, so I'm pretty content.</br>  Weak wonfes for me, but my wallet can rets easy for a whi-<br><br> 20K~ish Erza <br>FUCK</br></br></br>   waiting for Saitama figure <br> the first ones are both jointshit <br> anime will probably be shit so minimum figures will be made <br>Life is injustice. And figma to fucking boot, why it couldn't be Figuarts?</br></br></br>  <br> Literally </br>  <br>PVC</br>  <br>No cebo? No San?</br>  <br>The new Erza from X-Plus is great news, but what the fuck GSC, are you ever going to tell us what happened to your planned Erza?</br>  Quick preview. A pic of a pic   letting kotobukiya have hotarumaru <br>why did you let them do this GSC</br>  <br>Who are those in the back row?</br>  Base bodies for FAGs?  <br>I love idols but I didn't see anything worth getting at all.</br>  MAI WAIFU  So they did two Nicos in the same pose.  <br><br>That's a present I want to unwrap.</br></br>  <br>Maybe I'll finally buy Kino</br>   Pirate Sento <br> Ludger <br> That cute as fuck Kirby <br><br>Even though a lot of this was boats and Love Live, I'm pretty okay with the other stuff they showed. That Ramlethal was also cool as fuck, but she's a GG character I don't care too much about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like violent tsunderes nor do I like the tsundere trope in general. I suppose her design is fine, but her personality is incredibly appalling.</br>  <br>Is this what they call neo-/a/?</br>  <br>Is not even in the wall, I assume they cancelled her.<br>For some dumb reason since Lucy pretty much sold out right away when she released<br><br>Natsu and Gray shelfwarmed for a while (not even that long) but was expected</br></br></br></br>  <br>This girl is what tempts me to watch Love Live</br>  What is the point of Figfix?  <br>She is the only good thing about Love Live.</br>   No news <br>WELP</br>  <br>Nah man, look at the feet. Different. Same with the placement of the hands.</br>  <br>Scales for the financially challenged.</br>  <br>Not their most recent ones. It really didn't take long for the prices to inflate.</br>  <br> I assume they cancelled her <br>Yeah, this is what I was fearing. Oh well, they should at least had said something.</br></br>  <br>Do you think Alter's Nico might come with another hand? The hat must be removable.</br>  <br>wot</br>  <br>*the worst thing</br>  <br><br>This one?</br></br>  <br>Good, I don't want another SS Link.</br>  <br> trusting jews <br>Typical.</br></br>  <br>I wonder how will Alter's Nico butt look like.</br>  <br>swimsuit</br>  <br> 3264x2448 picture of a picture taken </br>  So /a/, now that the dust has settled, which gems will you be plunking down your hard earned shekels for?  Not the best GK but dat base.  Who oppai master race here  Worst Wonfes ever. Glad I didn't stay up for this shit.  <br>ok</br>  <br>No one cares.</br>  <br>Y-you anon.</br>  <br><br>Can't do much from the phone. Here it is the Ramlethal</br></br>  <br>Yeah. The only reason I really want to get it is because she's stepping on the best character in the show.</br>    <br> Dark-skinned swordgirl <br>I completely forgive you anon. Have a blessed night.</br></br>   11 boat scales <br> 10 sword scales <br> no touhou scales <br>It's dead.</br></br></br>    <br>Reporting!</br>  <br>I care.</br>  <br> there are actually people who want more touhou, miku and saber <br>Kill yourself. You are what's wrong with the figures industry.</br></br>  <br>It's shit. Shit.</br>  <br> 2hu in 2015  <br>Fucking seniors.</br></br>   All this swordshit <br>It's over. Buyfagging is dead.</br>  <br>Wait, is swordshit just fate stuff? Is that what it means?</br>  <br>Does the a58 have NFC so you could use the play memories app?</br>  <br>So what if I buy it. How do you explain it to your 10/10 hot gf?</br>  <br><br>Ah yes, the infamous Cum Gun™.</br></br>  <br>Swordshit is Touken Ranbu. Basically hot male swords for girls</br>  <br>It means gay figures for fujos and homos. Hence "swords."</br>  <br>It's kancolle for landwhales.</br>  <br>I'm gonna need a side view</br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh.<br><br>Wow, this looks remarkably terrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me too. Hopefully she will have some cute panties like Kotori.</br>  <br>We got more than 10 fujoshit scales.</br>  <br>This is the master race.</br>  <br>What does each male represent? A literal sword?</br>  <br>Yes, real Japanese swords.</br>  <br> Raita rori <br> Yukari Tamura ears <br> ugly fingers <br> bulimia body <br> skidmark eyebrows <br> flightdeck forehead <br><br>2/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>somebody is into lolis</br>  <br> preordering new donut Shinobu <br>Really?</br></br>  <br>Huh. Like which?</br>  <br>I don't think anybody expected anything from KLK.</br>  <br>I occasionally buy cowtits too. They just have to look REALLY good.</br>  Oh shit, there was a Sharo figure after all!<br><br>All is not lost.</br></br>  <br>http://touken-ranbu.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Characters</wbr></br>  <br>Why not? Kotobukiya did a good job with their first Shinobu.</br>    <br>Because it looks like shit? You can't even see her panties.</br>  <br><br>Not sure why is says 1/8 here and 1/7 in the announcement.</br></br>  <br>They could've at least put them in interesting poses or used the ones who actually look like males but nope. Why are fujos into feminine boys I'll never understand.</br>  <br><br>.<br> Still no Cocoa <br>2 nukes etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you expect anything else from raita?</br>  <br>Feminine boys are good but those poses were really boring. Also no best sword, fuck this shit.</br>  <br>Be careful, that is a lot of shit taste anon.</br>  <br>That little triangle of dress in between her legs will probably be removable, like it was with their Sena.</br>  How many years till painted?  <br> this <br> good </br></br>      <br>Which figure do you think is shit taste?</br>  <br><br>That seems to be a problem with a lot of male figures, really. They're all just standing there. I want more male figures but there are so few interesting ones.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Kashuu a shit. They chose all the worst swords. <br><br><br>I've noticed the same thing. It can't be that hard to make interesting and cool poses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow I didn't even notice it's Ritsu. Thought it's a random GK of a character I'm not familiar with.</br>  <br><br>This, plus bunny Erica.</br></br>  Finally woke up. Please tell me there were news on Tougou, or even Yuuna  <br>Forget Cocoa, where's Chiya?</br>  <br>All they need to do is give us their Shinken Hissatsu forms. Same hot boys but more dynamic and naked. Everyone's happy.</br>  <br>haha, nope.</br>  <br>MY LIFE FOR HER<br><br>Also besides her definitely the Medicine Seller from Mononoke and the German Boats.<br>I'll wait for the coloured version of Bismarck though first as I'm not completely sure how she'll turn out.<br>Prinz Eugen though is definitely a Buy.<br>Poi Poi~ from GSC too if it's good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure there was no worthwhile iM@S news, unless you mean secondary idolshit in which case whatever.</br>   Sentinel <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>Sentinel isn't bad, just expensive</br>    <br>Wasn't Sentinel the one with fucked up Levi?</br>  <br>You tell her to deal with it</br>  :&gt;  <br>Where was it Alter? <br>W H E R E</br></br>  <br>In the trash where it belongs.</br>  <br>My bad, it was Pulchra.</br>  <br>insufficient ribs</br>    <br>Oh man, you got me.</br>  <br> those crease lines <br>holy shit</br></br>  This is a nice Miku<br>The detail on the toes and fingers is a little overdone though</br>  <br>Hoping for ponytail and red ribbon accessories</br>   Miyu and Shirou are not blood related <br>Why is this allowed?<br>WHY IS THIS FUCKING ALLOWED?</br></br>  <br>Does this have anything to do with any of the fate night routes or not?</br>  <br>Wait, what? If that's true then what has the point of the this entire fucking series been? I thought Miyu was supposed to be from the family he had before the fire?</br>  Of course. Miyu is Japanese. We all know Shirou is a fucking mick.  <br>There were absolutely no indications that they were blood related, so I don't know why this is a surprise.<br><br>In fact the series is hammering in that Miyu is basically an alternate Illya and Illya isn't exactly blood related to Shirou either.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does the anime have Big-Head Mode enabled?</br>  <br>Highly likely that she's the daughter of Kiritsugu and Maya.</br>  The spoilers said she had red eyes when they found her and she could grant wishes. She probably wished herself into being Shirou's sister.  <br> &gt;Miyu and Shirou are not blood related </br>  <br> NTR <br>Oh the irony.</br></br>  <br>Shirou doesn't want to screw either of them.</br>  <br>So they can ruin this scene when it gets adapted.</br>  <br>Why would he? Neither of them needs mana transfer.</br>  <br> That side-chapter where Rin raised so many flags it looked like the flags would burst out of Shirou's pants and fuck Rin </br>  Rin x Fluffy Shirou end<br>Luvia x GAR Shirou end<br>Illya x Kuro x Miyu 3P ending<br><br>Official pairings. You can't prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm wondering if it'll get animated. It happens just a little after the beach episode, which is coming up.</br>  So is Hiryuu subbing the OVA as well as Herz?<br>If so, they need to hurry the fuck up.</br>  <br>Luvia x Fluffy Shirou end<br>(Illya x Kuro x Miyu) x GAR Shirou end<br>Rin x old men = money end</br></br></br>  <br><br>Everybody x nobody end, like every fucking thing ever.</br></br>  <br>Rin will win both Shirou and earn the harem she deserves.</br>  <br>Except for Rin, she still need the money.</br>  <br> why? <br>I like how even Type-Moon is poking fun at Shirou about that being his catch phrase.</br></br>  <br>She can marry Luvia.</br>  <br>They are blood-related. Nice bait by the way.</br>  <br> They are blood-related <br>Proof?</br></br>  <br>They call each other brother and sister and they never say that they're not blood-related. Assuming that they have the same parents makes sense since nobody says "this is my blood-related sister". Also they have the same eyes.</br>  <br><br>Latest chapter spoilers reveal that she already had a reputation/cult surrounding her in Fuyuki due to her powers long before Kiritsugu and Shirou ever met her.<br><br>They're NBR.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then that will mean war.</br>  <br>Are you saying he'd bone Kuro?</br>  <br>Who wouldn't?</br>  <br>Bone? He'd bone a sword.</br>  <br>Shirou has shit mana capacity, it wouldn't do shit even he came inside her.</br>  <br>Well she's technically a card copying a person made out of swords.</br>  <br>So she's a faker of a faker?</br>  <br>You know, considering how asspained Gil gets about the whole fake thing, he took the whole "being a copy stuffed into a card" thing surprisingly well.</br>  <br>Well that's ko-Gil, and that little shit is almost an entirely different character.</br>  <br> smoking Rin <br> Archer always saying 'Emiya Shirou' <br>Everytime.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Doesn't get blown up by a rocket launcher on a plane of zombies. <br> The world ends. <br><br>Maiya a shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maiya ain't Natalia, retard.</br>  <br>I thought she's whats left of the grail's influence with tiny amount of heavens feel.</br>  <br>That spoiler was fake.</br>  5 years and 9 months ago, Kiritsugu and Shirou arrived at Fuyuki City to investigate the Cult/Belief/Religion of the "Child of God" but was iterrupted by a black fog enveloping the city, though shortly It dissapered and Shirou found Miyu in the house of Sayutsuki.<br><br>Kiritsugu understood that the "Child of God" has the ability to grant wishes and alter the present without limitation.<br><br>With this, Kiritsugu decided to adopt the child and bought a house in the city to start his research.<br><br>Shirou wanted to celebrate Miyu's 6th birthday, but Kiritsugu forbade him from doing so, as he wanted to use the child of god to save humanity and end his long journey.<br><br>As a 12 year old child, Shirou is now facing the Emiya family dilemma of choice.<br><br>"Save the world" or "Save Miyu"?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wow this thread is deader than Miyu's hymen.  <br>Many anons died after fapping to death from the OVA and episode 1.</br>  I only want s4  Has the OVA been subbed yet?  <br>No.</br>  <br>When will the OVA be subbed?</br>  <br>Ask Hiryuu.</br>  <br>He was a fake in F/SN and he didn't care at all. He is simply a hypocrite.</br>  <br>Was Gil ever confronted on that?<br><br>Maybe he was one sentence away from having a massive existential crisis that was never brought up over the span of ten years.</br></br></br>  <br>He was very very close to that crisis in UBW. If Rin had opted to use the Catalyst Toki left her, there would have been two Gils.<br><br>Just imagine how much he'd hate himself.</br></br></br>    <br> There were absolutely no indications that they were blood related <br><br>They actually have one physical trait in common that they share with only one other Nasuverse character: they have an extra ring inside their iris, around the pupil. Only one other character in the entire Nasuverse has that, Hisui. Add to that the fact that they have the same eye color (and a color you don't see much of in the Nasuverse either), and it was a fairly reasonable assumption.<br><br>Maybe the author really wanted her to be Shirou's blood sister, but Nasu vetoed it.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Also would you believe I grabbed that image out of searching through moe and not going to Mangafox? I just remembered the name of the manga and wanted to find that page.</br>  Man, the power level in Prisma is all fucked, Kuro is able to trace fucking Excalibur of all things and even fire it like Caladbolg, but somehow can't use full Rho Aias (only 4 petals like what Shirou did in HF).  <br>That is kind of fucking stupid.</br>  <br>to be fair also, miyuverse shirou can straight up make divine artifacts while not giving a singular fuck.</br>  I'M POSTING PERRINE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME    <br>Shut up and post more perrine with sexy lingeries.</br>      ASSEMBLED FOR INTERCOURSE      <br>Superior blonde.</br>  <br><br>THIS IS A PERRINE ONLE ZONE<br><br>ANY OTHER LIFEFORM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Perrine to call me names.</br>    <br>What Victory Arrow subs do we have?

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Ruri is in fact, XYZ/Ruri, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, XYZ plus Ruri. Ruri is not an imouto unto itself, but rather another free individual of a fully functioning XYZ universe made useful by the Overlay Network, Overlay Units and Ranks, thus comprising a dimension as defined by the Numeron Code.  <br>Old whore losing to new whore.</br>    Not really that upsetting. Gon got to show off more cards, Crow is more important to the current plot, and this isn't the first time Gon has lost to show someone being stronger (he lost in the Battle Royal so Yuzu could double OTK).  Have you bought Blackwings yet, /a/rc-V?  <br>Stallman pls.</br>  <br>People like Yuzu, nobody likes Crow or his Blackwings.</br>  <br>No one was butthurt about that because Gon knows his bro likes a hoe and so he will go to any extent necessary to make sure that she stayed in the tournament so that he could duel her like he promised her he would.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Gon's schtick has always been self-sacrifice, almost to a fault</br>  <br>I sure as hell like Crow more than Gon.</br>   Episode 65 <br> no Jack Atlas remix <br><br> Episode 66 <br> nothing happens <br><br> Episode 67 <br> Gon loses to a meme <br><br>show = dropped<br><br>I knew I should have stopped after Season 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reposting Gongenzaka's new Superheavy Kishou<br> Pendulum effect: When a SHS monster you control destroys an opponent's monster by battle, you can destroy this card; that monster can attack again. <br> Monster effect: This card is treated as a "Superheavy Samurai" monster while on the field. If you have no Spell/Trap cards in your Graveyard, you can tribute up to 2 SHS monsters you control; draw 1 card for each monster tributed. You can only use this effect once per turn. <br>So is it any good? You can't search it or anything and it's level 1 so you can't Pendulum Summon it constantly</br></br></br>  <br>See you next week.</br>  <br>They're both shit characters, but Crow is way worse, he steals the spotlight from people constantly and blackwings are shit cards.</br>  <br>FUCK OFF??!!</br>  <br> Level 1 Pendulum <br>Looks like the Sawatari virus got him, poor Gon.</br></br>  F uck all of you Crow haters <br><br> Stay mad, Gonfags </br></br>  <br>I don't know who you are, but I will find you, and when I do, I'll card you.</br>  Bringing back old characters was a mistake.  <br>It's Reiji, he only makes cards good for himself and Dennis.</br>   realized that everytime Gon shows a new Synchro, he loses.   <br>Stay salty.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128613741 <br>Yeah now that I realize it, every time Gon shows off a new Synchro, he does lose.

He's dueled for a good bit up to this point, and we all know others are going to eventually fetch him from wherever he's sent (or he escapes on his own).  <br> probably one of the best duels of Synchro arc <br>That's because all the duels in the Synchro Arc have been shit. The only good duel since Yuya vs. Reiji was against Chojiro.</br></br>  <br>I agree, especially direct sequels. Yes, I'm talking about GX, Fuck GX!</br>  <br>I hope Crow replaces Gon as a lancer that would be good.</br>  <br> Crow is more important to the current plot <br>How so? I haven't started the Syncro World arc yet.</br></br>  <br>He's basically a shit commander. Once the Lancers fall apart, he's probably going to bargain Serena/Yuzu to R/Leo to keep Standard safe.</br>  <br>lel Gongenzaka gets new card shilled every duel. You guys are the reason we still don't have Yuto, Serena, or Funky Comedian cards</br>  <br>He's a genius, not a shit commander. He's intentionally fucking over certain characters to get a specific reaction out of other people. He's even manipulating his own brother just to get to Yuya.</br>  <br> M-muh Steadfast dueling <br> D-dont need Action card </br></br>  <br>Then watch and find out for yourself</br>  <br>If Konami wanted to print them, they would, no matter what a bunch of gaijin manchildren say.<br><br>They don't, so they're not.</br></br></br>   All these crowfags in this thread. <br>I can believe such shit taste, /Arc-V/ used to be better.</br>  <br>Blame the delusional faggots who liked gay Transformers knockoffs and toy dragons.<br><br>Boipussy lust stronk. Especially if its shota pussy</br></br></br>  <br>No man only based Blackwings deserve to be printed. I can't wait for Crow to become Yuyas new best friend.</br>  <br>He got to show off more SHS and that's all that really mattered. He was the most important character that Crow could beat, anyone more important would bullshit a win somehow even if they're "weaker." The only characters left Crow has to beat are whoever wins between Shinji/Tsukikage, Tokumatsu, fodder, Sawatari if he isn't fed to strongu, and possibly Serena but that one's not going to happen anyway.</br>  <br>Does Reiji know that Dennis is from Fusion?</br>  <br>watch it dumbass</br>   people unironically liking Crow in any capacity   <br>We will be getting Yuto's cards printed soon with the reveal of the XYZ booster set. Serena will get her cards printed in the next Fusion oriented booster set alongside the Ancient Gear support. Sawatari's Underworld Trope would probably be printed in a set like the Secret Forces.</br>  <br> People still mad over Crow </br>  <br> Steadfast duel <br> already riding on a D-Wheel <br>fucker should have just picked up the action card</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>This is bullshit. Every card Gongenzaka has used thus far bar this duel has been released. It's turning into BUY SUPERHEAVIES at this point.<br><br>Where the fuck are Serena's cards? Where are Sawatari's? Where the fuck are Reiras?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everything after 64 is shit <br>Kek, if that happens people won't have Yoshida to blame this time.</br></br>  <br>Why would Reiji want to extend Yuya's list of strikes against himself?</br>  <br>I'm not even mad that Gon lost, I even knew it was going to happen, I'm just mad that people are being absolutely fucking obnoxious about it right now.</br>  <br>ITS PART OF KEIKAKU</br>  <br>It's like pottery.</br>  <br><br>Fine. Be stingy about it.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you ask Konami?</br>  <br>I don't mind Crow, but that is wrong as shit.</br>  <br><br>Fusion special pack like HSR and Wings raider</br></br>  <br>Because Reiji gets a sadomasochistic surge out of toeing the line of danger by walking on the edge, whether it's making barters he can't fulfill or putting himself in the way of self-harm.<br><br>Hence, D/D/D.</br></br></br>  <br>Moonlights are just Tenki + Allure targets. What do they do that is more exciting than Fluffals?<br><br>Sawatari's new deck is just Dart Shooters all over again.<br><br><br> Faggots buttblasted over their Sora 0.5 job slut </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jack is successful and he isn't. <br><br>That's pretty much his relevancy.</br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Gonfag. This happens every time duels like this take place.</br>  <br> Implying they wouldn't give some non-answer <br>You know damn well we cant' ask any soulless corporation about anything and get a straight answer.</br></br>  <br>I don't feel nearly as frustrated as I was with 5D's, though</br>  <br>Crow's Yusei?</br>  <br>At least it's not a shitty filler arc like pre-WRGP</br>  <br>I once emailed them and asked them when they were going to make NK actually good, and they just told me to keep buying their stuff.</br>  <br>Might as well be Synchro's Yusei instead of Yugo.</br>   Crow Riding Duel <br>Previous thread explode to 600+ posts.<br>Best part of that episode is Crow stunt with Blackbird grabbing Action Card</br></br>  <br>It would have been the same had Gongenzaka won, except more people would be talking shit about Crow and spamming DONT BUY BLACKWINGs</br>  It's okay guys, Crow is simply better than Gon<br> Just like how Reiji was better than Yuya </br>  <br>I'm not mad about Gon losing neither, but more about Crow winning. You could replace Gon with Sawatari, Dennis, Ninja, or even with ENJOY, and I would be still mad. Crow has no impact to the plot, nor any emotional involvement with any of the Lancers, so I don't know why he is still in the tournament.</br>  <br>What you think is irrelevant. They will get released sooner or later anyway. ;)</br>  <br>Would've been better if he started flying instead with those wings</br>  <br><br>So this is the curse of Synchro summoning, isn't it?</br></br>  What even   Under the command of Akaba Leo, he is trying to kidnap Yuzu and Serena away to the Fusion Dimension <br> and Serena </br>  <br> tfw Reiji, Sawatari, and Shun become the new cool kids and spend their time running through academia halls disrupting class shouting Serena and Ruri </br>  <br>I once asked if they could name the card artist for Laundsallyn, and they replied that they wish they knew, but have no idea. And that they hope I can find out somehow on my own.<br><br>Who else besides Konami am I supposed to ask?</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt he's strong enough to carry 2 girls at the same time.<br>Also, Fusion arc pls hurry.</br></br>  <br>I'm more expecting Yuzu to go around screaming Serena.mp3 to every faceless mook she sees after Serena gets kidnapped in place of Yuzu.</br>  Reminder that Synchro was a mistake  <br>This is pretty much a shitty pre-Academia filler arc, though.</br>  I fucking hate Crow. I hate his design. I hate his monsters's design except one or two. Even so i knew that he was most likely to win because him winning would create infighting between the Lancers and make the plot more interesting.<br>If Gon won what would happen. Crow entrusts Yuya with showing them Tops like every shounen hero?</br>  <br>Dennis will take Serena with him while Yuri takes Yuzu.</br>  <br>Its boring bur the Crow hatedom would rather have something that simple than more turkeybirds filling packs.</br>  I'm more interested in seeing matches between characters that really, really don't want to fight each other. Mainly Yuya, Serena, or Yugo vs Yuzu.  <br>I don't think Serena cares too much honestly.</br>  <br> losers of tourney are put into forced labor <br> Reiji probably knows this if Chojiro does <br> Gon can take it since he's a mountain of a man <br> risks sending Reira there despite that him being like 10 years old, and untested <br><br>What is wrong with Reiji?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of Serena's reason for joining the Lancers is for Yuzu.</br>  <br>Implying this isnt all part of his keikaku</br>  <br>Try only reason, she's going to kidnap Yuzu.</br>  <br>Yeah but if Yuzu goes to the mines, Serena will just leave the cup and go rescue her, leading to Yuri/Dennis capturing them both.</br>   Losers get sent to forced labour <br>OH SHIT WE CRASHTOWN ARC AGAIN<br> MANZOKU </br></br>  Wonder how Yuya and Chojiro got out of their suiteprison cell.<br><br>Feels like the reason why Yuya bumped into Reiji and Reira in the first place was because it was his chance to look for Yuzu.</br></br>  <br>Chojiro has mad connections because he's fucking Chojiro, so he pretty much gets to roam free every so often.<br><br>Reiji, and as a result Reira, can do whatever the fuck he pleases because he's Kaikakuman.</br></br></br>  <br> Wonder how Yuya and Chojiro got out of their suiteprison cell. </br>  <br>BLACKBIRD BEST DUEL RUNNER</br>  <br>Yes, please.<br><br>It's one of my favorites 5D's mini-arcs.</br></br></br>   1 Tuner + or more non-Tuner monsters <br> If this card was Synchro Summoned using a "Blackwing" monster as a Synchro Material, it is treated as a Tuner monster. Once per turn: You can send 1 "Blackwing" monster from your hand to the Graveyard; inflict 300 damage to your opponent. </br>  <br> Blackwings get delta accel synchro </br>  Synchro arc was a mistake<br>Crow was a mistake</br>  <br>Reiji never steps away from looking the big picture. To the point that he views everyone else as pieces on a gameboard, and never gets that close with anyone.<br><br>In contrast, Yuya strays from the bigger picture when he gets fixated on what's close to himYuzu, but he also has a few genuine friends.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu <br>I meant to put that in parentheses</br></br>  Why didn't Gon use Flutist?  <br>Kiryu should have been better than Crow in Arc-V, imho.  Also Infernities &gt; Blackwings. </br>  <br>Doesnt have the same effect</br>  <br>How exactly? He would have drove that hatred for the Jack harder than Crow has and wouldn't have anything to add to the plot besides working on the mines.</br>  <br> People actually like Kiryu <br>That's a good enough reason. Especially since the 5D Characters were brought back for fanservice and BUY BLACKWINGS.</br></br>  You guys told me ARC-V was good.  <br>Oh right. Flutist is shit in the anime. I forgot. Shame because it could have saved Gon at least twice.</br>  <br>It was, until Ep. 65, just like 5Ds, and guess who is the fault of both of them.<br><br>Crow.</br></br></br>  <br>IT KEEPS HAPPENING</br>  I'm a 5Ds fag who hasn't really seen Arc V. Watched it so I could see the satsification of Crow losing. He fucking wins against an Arc V character who I know has lots of cards released so he must be fairly prominent. Damn you guys. You said it would be different. He just went full BUY BLACKWINGS.  <br>Stop this stupid meme. People like Crow too, you guy just force your unnecessary hatred for him down everyone's throat like cancer. You dislike 5D's Crow so you take it out on Arc-V Crow? Retarded.<br><br>And the 5D's characters brought back were popular characters, character that people liked and were well versed in Synchro Summoning for the Synchro Dimension. Not to mention Kiryu only has one Synchro monster.that he only used once. In a filler arc.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not convinced until they spend 3-4+ episodes on cup ramen or something relating to cup ramen and a tiny clown</br>  <br> a-am i fitting in guys..? </br>  This has to be the most polarizing duel yet.  <br>That's Sora vs Shun the first round.</br>  <br>It's honestly hilarious<br><br>Crow haters can stay mad as long as they want, doesn't change the fact that the angrier they get, the clearer it gets that they are all getting their asses devastated by Blackwings</br></br></br>  <br> People like Crow too <br>Outside of Tumblr fangirls not really. Most were meh on him or disliked him. Blackwings were popular, not Crow. After his first few duels he stopped using good Blackwings which led to more hate because now it was just pack filler. Back in 5Ds days you couldn't even discuss Crow without starting a flame war. He's back for BUY BLACKWINGS not popularity.</br></br>  <br>Most people just laugh at Sora for being a egomaniacal scrub.<br><br>Even when he beat Shun I just could not care.<br><br><br>Generic Blackwings are why my ship faggotry died and/or Morphtronics aren't tier 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its fucking obvious some people are going to get carded and crow and jacku are going to join the lancers because fucking academia is gonna rekt shit before the tournament ends.<br><br><br>My carded list:<br><br> Gongenzaka <br> The ENJOYYY guy <br> Dennis <br> Reiji </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I fucking love THE MAN GONGENZAKA and I dunno what you guys were even bitching about.<br><br>That was a great duel and this version of Crow is a really good character. 5D's happened like five years ago, get over it.</br></br>  <br>Good thing Blackwings aren't part of the meta, they get run over too easily.</br>  <br>I dunno, I can't really bring myself to be worked up over it. I get why Crow winning is annoying, but people are acting like it's the dealbreaker to end all dealbreakers, and it's not like Gon lost 4000-0</br>  <br> Judai's soul patch. </br>  <br>Fujos are people too.<br><br>Terrible people but they are part of the YGO fandom.<br><br>Besides people tolerate Shun despite his Marty Stu shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I dunno what you guys were even bitching about. <br>Crow</br></br>  <br>I know right. People are acting like Crow beat Gongenzaka 4000-0. Crow was down to a 100 LP people.<br>Though I wouldn't call Crow great.</br></br>  Since Gongenzaka lost and they throw him out the competition/building/tops does this mean he is gonna  be carded   <br>If Crow and Jack join the Lancers I'm fucking done with this. It just stops being Arc-V at that point and becomes 5Ds 2 and them trying to fix the mistakes of the past. <br><br>That's stupid, they need to stay in Synchro and that's it. <br><br>Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon isn't getting carded pre Academia. I doubt any of the Lancers even Tsukikage are.</br>  <br> this version of Crow is a good character <br><br> 5Ds Crow <br>FOOD AND KIDS<br> Arc-V Crow <br>FOOD AND KIDS<br><br>He's the same character, he's just got less time to talk so it's not as hard to see him as as big of a fag as he was in 5Ds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow <br>Why</br></br>  <br>Shun fades into the background after he does his thing. Like his whole 3OTK against elite Security was followed by him having not said a word since the point Reiji made his re-entrance.</br>  <br> he's just got less time to talk <br>that fixes like 90 fucking percent of the problems with 5D's Crow, so.</br></br>  <br>Ninja because he's a plot device of character's being able to escape easily, it's why there aren't two of them around, because two guys flashing in and out is broken, and him being in Academia would be a bit too broken towards the Lancers. <br><br>ENJOY, because, well old dudes never survive sadly. <br><br>Crow's friends because they're useless, Shinji and Crow because they'll protect the kids.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow. <br>So basically you want the plan to make Synchro allies to assault Academia null because you're butthurt about Crow?<br><br>Jeez man</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then what was the point of going to Synchro in the first place if everyone will be carded?</br>  <br>Crow got a Signer dragon and was overall background noise.<br><br>Shun will probably wreck Crow just because Xyz swag and you gotta make the eternally asshurt Rua and Aki fans happy. It'll make synchrofags mad though.</br></br></br>  <br>They can recruit Shinji. Imagine the rage if Crow became a permament cast member.</br>  <br>Why do a handful matter when Reiji's gunning for the Council to put the entire City and its forces on Standard's side?</br>  <br> Imagine the rage if Crow became a permament cast member. <br>Who cares?</br></br>  <br> Crow defeats Dennis <br><br>Oh lawd people would scream and want turkeys dead.</br></br></br>  So the latest chapter has been released and translated a few days ago? Have you changed your opinion?  <br>I don't know OP, you tell me if it's stopped being complete and total garbage.</br>  <br> It just got better with the new chapter. </br>    I'll pick it up when it ends. Even then, that might be a bit of a chore to go through all the forced drama.  <br>This is a train wreck that I just can't look away from. Rumors are that in November is when they finally fuck.</br>     Yuzu fangirl <br>Welp</br>        Harumin best girl  Johj are going 9/11 on america's ass  <br>RIP Thread.</br>  <br>Shh OP, your newfag is showing.</br>  <br>Always knew 9/11 was a roach job</br>  <br><br>Wow, someone is still going through translating this shit?</br></br>  <br>lel</br>  I liked this anime.<br>It Peaked my curiosity at how creative they could get at scaling bugs and plants and birds and shit 1:1 to human size. made it interesting. too bad the writing went all fking weird. Had best girl though</br>  <br>The powers and main characters are still very appealing, though. Even if the writing has gone over-the-top with chapters like these, I think it's still worth reading to see what they do with Shokichi, Joseph, Liu and Ichiro. I've got a feeling that Liu is going to have even more plot relevance in the future; given that the Chinese government has essentially betrayed him.</br>  <br>At least its kind of moving away from the politics shit</br>  <br>Agreed.<br>Alot of interesting characters and limmitless creativity. Having the fihgt on Earth now seems.... Off though. Woulda been better if everyone got on Chinas ship and then they had a hostile takeover and then returned to Earth to find it partially destroyed. then show through 'flashback' allthough it isnt really, what happend on earth. like make Earths fight the final one. instead of both happening at once. As there are so many Plots going on at once its tricky. we need more Johj info</br></br>  <br><br>Who takes shower with glass? Fucking fake</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon, let me make it up to you.<br>Jump in the bed</br></br>  <br>Wait so is it confirmed that the roaches can still Sylar away powers from other dead people? Because then it gets kind of fucky.</br>  <br>yeah they can. I duno how but they can. Havent seen bull ant jojh yet though. And if all thye need is genetic material they can coppy Cap Hornet as well coz bugs 2 Jojh took 2 of his punching pincers</br>  <br>this 20/10 body, too bad she get paired with worst boia</br>  <br>I've only seen the anime. Is lightning eel dead? He was my favorite.</br>  It's still somewhat entertaining, but ever since the author stopped killing established characters it lost all tension.  Shh, loli is sleeping  you wish            dude, lolis lmao  OMG I POSTED IT AGAIN XDDDD<br>LOLI SLEEEPING GET IT LOL<br>SLEEPING DON'T POST LOWD THINGS BUT YOU DO ROFL<br>COMON GUYZ ITS A BIG ONE</br></br></br>  <br>what are you even talking about.</br>  something something blue shirts  Reposted shit : the thread.    Why is loli always sleeping?  <br>maybe her butt hurts</br>  <br>From what?</br>  what would you do if a milky tried pooping in front of you?  <br>What is that semen demon dreaming about?</br>  <br>She plays too much and too hard with onii-chan.</br>  <br> Shh, loli is sleeping </br>     [Commie] Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX - 04 [25B058CA].mkv   Why are Micha's sound effects so cartoony?  <br> using my screenshot from when HPC-HC shit itself <br>Surely someone has a better screen cap</br></br>  <br><br>Because Micha is all cartoony?<br><br>Threadly does of Kirika.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The bgm when Micha shows up was spooky and beautiful.</br>  watching these leg thingies when fighting Micha was amazing.  <br>Look at her.</br>  <br><br>I love how she went all out,  and it was completely futile .</br></br>  <br> didn't change gloves into the giant rocket things that fucked up K2 <br> all out </br></br>  <br> that scream <br>Aoi Yuuki is literally a miracle of the universe.</br></br>  <br>In her defense she got rused pretty hard.<br><br>Hell, most everybody watching got rused pretty hard.<br><br><br>Probably not the easiest thing to summon on the fly and without the phonic  bullshit  gain of two other active Gears in the vicinity<br><br><br>There was much screaming this episode. I fear for seven.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what's wrong with your screencap?</br>  Do we have a release date for Glorious Break yet?  <br>I always wonder how do those things work. Besides that, Micha's jet drills were cool.</br>  <br>Got a message on Steam and apparently my computer thought that was too much to handle and MPC proceeded to shit itself. Even going back to earlier points in the episode didn't fix it</br>   shitty Hibiki going "hurr it's my Gungnir, give it back, you can't have it" to Maria <br>Not only is she a bitch for pulling that after Maria risked her life to save both her and her dumbass friends, but isn't the Gungnir she has now the one that Maria gave to her at the end of season 2? What a cunt.</br>  <br>I hope Shirabe's charmpoint will be a closeup of her cunt.</br>  <br>It's fine when Hibiki does it though because she had a depressing emo childhood.</br>  <br><br>Since Kirika's transformation included pretty much everything of her body, I presume it will be the same for Shirabe. I'm expecting a focus on her butt though.</br></br>  <br>Bullshit. Tsubasa and Chris went through a lot more than she has, and they don't act like whiny hypocritical bitches.</br>  <br>They're also not mentally retarded.</br>  <br>True enough. Miku needs to fuck some sense into Hibiki already.</br>  Why is Kirika's transformation so much lewder than Chris' and Tsubasa's?  <br> wanted to post the "Let Me Tell You Why That's Bullshit" caption <br> I didn't save it <br> Even though I was the one who thought of it in the first place <br><br>Ha ha time for sudoku.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm thrilled that Miku managed to pull Hibiki's head out of her ass enough to explain to her that she's been saving people with the Symphogear by fighting since she got it. She doesn't have to kill them with it, she can just punch them till they're not a threat and then try to talk to them. I'm amazed that Hibiki couldn't figure this out on her own through simple observation.</br>  I wonder how Nana feels about current Bikki. She could probably relate.  <br>Because Chris and sword don't need time for lewds.<br>Kirika on the other hand needs to lewd it up for   the dual transformation with Shirabe. </br></br>  <br><br><br>Shirabe henshin when</br></br></br>  <br>most likely episode 6.</br>  <br><br>Surprise, people have different personalities, different talents, different faults.<br>Just because one person deals well with something doesn't mean everyone can.<br>Chris and Tsubasa are certainly more resilient than Hibiki, but without Hibiki's positive traits and power nothing of what they achieved together could have been achieved.</br></br></br></br>  Guy working his way through season 2, just hit Genjurou singing the goddamn Police Story theme and Yuka Iguchi insert song.<br><br>About damn time this season got good-ish.</br></br>  <br>nothing belongs to you</br>  <br> but without Hibiki's positive traits and power nothing of what they achieved together could have been achieved. <br>Nanoha would have gotten it done in half the time with fewer casualties and would have solved everyone's emotional issues while she was fighting.</br></br>   Micha's face when you force your dick inside her non existent ass.   <br>The last disc of the soundtrack on the last BD.</br>  When do the BDs go up for pre-order? Also anyone else going to try to go to Symphogear Live?  Is there an updated list of keywords for this season yet, or are they just translated randomly throughout the threads?  <br>It looks like she has little heart-shaped pupils.</br>  <br>Nanoha's magic is not lethal so she's no reason to be afraid of accidentally killing someone. And why did you bring in someone in an entire different show with an entire different setting here?</br>  <br>Nanoha is Nanoha, Hibiki is Hibiki.<br>Hibiki has had troubles in every season, she was never intended to be a Mary Sue and that's good, Mary Sues are boring as fuck.<br>Are you judging the characters depending on how well they perform to achieve an overall desired outcome the best and most efficient way possible?<br>If you do that, Symphogear might actually be the wrong show for you.</br></br></br></br>  So, why they keep using heavenrend instead of Ame no Habakiri?  <br>It's not like Hibiki survived something she should not survive, which then caused her and her family a lot of suffering. Something like that would probably fuck her mentally, but thankfully that didn't happen, so comparing her to Nanoha totally makes sense.</br>  <br>They like seeing us get mad.</br>  <br>It's either because they want to be consistent or want to tease you. Or both.</br>  <br> Nanoha's magic is not lethal <br>Are you joking?<br><br> And why did you bring in someone in an entire different show with an entire different setting here? <br>You claimed Hibiki was essential to getting what they got done because of her personality, I said that's not true because another mahou shoujo protagonist does everything Hibiki does but better. Things didn't work out only because Hibiki is Hibiki; she could have been different and things would have worked.<br><br><br>Characters don't need to be Mary Sues, but you can't make them borderline retarded and just say "Well that's a personality flaw and if they plot moves because of that you have to deal with it." There's a limit to how ignorant you can be about literally everything and she crosses that line a lot. The rest of the cast members balance out problems and progross just fine in their own ways but she doesn't.<br><br> If you do that, Symphogear might actually be the wrong show for you. <br>You can fuck right off this. Someone insulting a character you like doesn't mean they don't like the show. Don't be an idiot.<br><br><br>I can't even tell if you're trying to be sarcastic because your sentence is a non sequitur mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's because Micha's into S&amp;M like Bikki and Miku.</br>   Micha walking in the street one night <br> sees her coming around the corner <br> masturbate <br> ejaculate when she's about to turn <br> hfw <br>it will be so worth it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They once made that terrible pun and now they can't go back.</br></br>  <br><br>Are people really impressed by that? It sounded more like her normal voice than Hibiki's. <br><br> I don't know if it's the directing, script, or something else but I've found Aoi's performance this season to be lackluster </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Micha masturbates and ejaculates in Garie's face?<br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>oh fuck, I messed up that one.</br>  So are Micky, Gary, Larry, and Pharrell our official nicknames for the dolls?  <br> I've found Aoi's performance this season to be lackluster <br>Dude what?<br>Like what? What? What the fuck?</br></br></br>  <br>Aoifags, everyone.</br>  What the hell is Heavenrend anyway? How is it related to Snake Slayer?  <br>heavenrend rends the heavens.</br>  <br>Here's some more</br>    <br>Heavenrend rend the heavens, Snake Slayer slay snacks.</br>  <br>And of corse you can't forget the most useful of them all</br>  <br>So close.</br>  <br><br>Maybe it's deliberate to emphasize Hibiki's insecurity and hesitation.</br></br>  <br>doujins where Hibiki is forced to watch Micha finger Miku with her claws when?</br>  <br> 10110 <br>From binary to decimal it's 22. Nice dubs!</br></br>  <br><br>Her singing has been average at best<br>Her acting has been okay but it's Symphogear so of course everything sounds over acted<br><br>Yeah she's cute and does an amazing job pandering to fans but I'd hardly call her a miracle.<br><br>Could also be that I'm biased towards voices like Maria's and Tsubasa's, the only high pitched voice I like in the the show is Chris's.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You can go fuck yourself.</br>  <br>Really the only gear user seiyuu with a weaker performance than Aoi's is Kayano, and even that's arguable.<br><br>Really, putting her in a music show with a bunch of singing heavies like Hikasa and Mizuki is just asking for negative comparisons.<br><br>But whatever, I still enjoy her enough</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Finger <br>Son we are a FISTING family, we don't waist our time with child games.<br>  She will double fist then dissect her form the inside  </br></br></br>  <br> Are you joking? <br>Nope, they specifically declare that in the show. The magic in itself can destroy buildings and shit but can never kill human.</br></br>  <br>Where did those even come from?</br>  <br> they specifically declare that in the show <br>When did this happen?</br></br>  <br><br>True, it is a little unfair that she's next to 3 talented singers. And I don't mean Aoi is bad, she does an overall good job as Hibiki and her singing has gotten a lot better since season 1. I just think stuff like calling her Little Miracle is a bit too much.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm so sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's not good enough to slavishly worship (because she's any seiyuu, ever), but she's definitely good enough to appreciate if she suites your tastes and to not really be bothered by if she doesn't.</br>  <br>But she literally is a Little Miracle of  my heart. </br>  <br><br><br>I think people worship her not because of her seiyuu performance, it's more like people just love her because she is like a little lovely genki ball of energy, and that makes them biased towards overrating her voice.<br>And Aoi really seems to be a lovely person, so I can't blame them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is noting for you to apologize for, that was just the next logical step to be taken.</br>  Apparently no one made this without text all over her yet.  <br>I'm a Nanafag, but Aoi has her great qualities too. She's really lovable.</br>  <br>Somewhere in Strikers when Fate explained to Carol and Eriol about why they use magic instead of conventional weapon. In S2, Yuuno also told Nanoha to blast Reinforce out of Hayate with a pure magic attack because Hayate wouldn't be hurt that way. More details in the drama CDs.</br>  <br> isn't the Gungnir she has now the one that Maria gave to her at the end of season 2? <br>It is, Maria gave it to her, that’s why it’s hers now.</br></br>  Hibiki looks pissed off at this unfaithfulness. How will she punish Miku?  <br>Needs sound tho.</br>  <br>I don't really know if its a punishment to her or not but the only real thing hibiki could do is fisting</br>  So nobody else trusts that project ignite shit right?  <br>I'll behead Elfnein if anything bad happens to my waifu.</br>  <br>Did you fucking hear the ominous noise when they revealed it?</br>  <br>But Kirika's gear isn't going through project ignite.</br>  <br>Who said Kirika was my waifu?</br>  <br>It would be the biggest plot twist in the history of Symphogeah if it's not a trap.</br>  <br>No way in hell it doesn't lead into multiple berserkers or at least someone dyeing trying to stop it or   Genjuro having to fight several edgy teenagers since there are no noise.  </br>  <br>Oh, I was just assuming you had good taste.</br>  <br>You telling me you can say no to this face?</br>  <br><br>What if it's a mix of both? Project Ignite itself is obviously working into Carol's plans, but as a result of Elfnein not being under her direct control, things are added to it that Carol doesn't expect and causes her plans to go awry, basically fucking everyone over.</br></br>  <br> The rest of the cast members balance out problems and progross just fine <br>They did progress in the previous seasons but you know, I feel like they’re being ignored now in a similar way Hibiki was back then. <br><br> enemy is clearly a sentient being <br> can talk just fine and seems to be very intelligent <br> moves strangely though as judged from fucking 100 meters away <br> haha not human, killkillkilll! <br><br>Even ignoring how they completely dismiss dolls as subhuman (which they aren’t, they even have human parts due to being based on Carol), they might for all intents and purposes have attacked extremely skilled dancers there. That’s seriously fucked up and out of character. As in the previous seasons with Hibiki they completely ignored some characters to have the plot unfold faster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are the reason alone that I love Hibiki's gear the most. Her fights when she goes all out are always some of the most exciting.</br>  <br>Does short-hair girl not have a name or have I somehow missed it through 2.5 seasons?<br><br>Because she's best tertiary sidekick character</br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki's angry face directly over Miku holding hand with someone else <br><br>Subtle.<br><br><br>They have no choice but to go with what they're given right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Has sound on wsg. <br/></br>  <br> Yuuno also told Nanoha to blast Reinforce out of Hayate with a pure magic attack because Hayate wouldn't be hurt that way. <br>If magic doesn't hurt people then why did they need to protect their friends with magic shields when the Reinforce defence system was on a rampage?</br></br>  <br>What you're said is like saying Shinji Ikari is a shit character because Ryoma from Getter Robo, or even Kouji from the Mazinger franchise would have gotten in the robot and defeated the angels faster, and without bitching like Shinji did</br>  <br>Best color, best theme, best gear, DeathDeathDesu Reaper</br>  <br>Because there's lethan and non-lethal magic<br>Nanoha has her set on non-lethal, but Reinforce's was definitely lethal</br></br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br> They did progress in the previous seasons but you know, I feel like they’re being ignored now in a similar way Hibiki was back then. <br>Hibiki is the main character, and nothing new even happened to cause her development. Miku literally told her "Just think about everything you've done and how it worked out." Having Hibiki be too stupid to pay attention to every action she's taken and how they've worked out is bad writing.<br><br> they might for all intents and purposes have attacked extremely skilled dancers there <br>That's ridiculous. They're experienced fighters and all of them were able to see they were superhuman monsters within moments of fighting them. On top of that, they had no problem killing innocent people.<br><br><br> What you're said <br>Shit grammar aside, all I did was point out that "These things only got done because Hibiki is Hibiki." is false.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Even though I think Hibiki acting this way is completely valid I don't really have any problems with the other characters being willing to hurt people considering their pasts. <br><br>That said people pretending like they're totally above being scared and would totally act impartially to beat up anyone that threatened what mattered to them is ridiculous. It's just the usual upset whenever people don't realize that characters aren't omnipotent entities like they are as a viewer.</br></br></br>  <br> Magic can still be lethal <br> People comment on Nanoha overdoing it with her befriending and hurting people <br>Then you can't say her magic is non-lethal because sometimes it doesn't kill people. That's like saying gunshots aren't lethal because you can aim for someones foot.</br></br></br>  <br>Midchildan magic doesn't hurt people. Reinforce and the Wolkies use Belkan, and that style has emphasis on actually physically hitting people with actual weapons, which does hurt people. The Book of Darkness was also known for exploding and doing otherwise killy things.</br>  Am I in a Nanoha thread?  <br> Midchildan magic doesn't hurt people. <br>But she blew Fate out of the sky in season 1, and in season 2 they upgraded to the cartridge system which is Belkan technology.</br></br>  <br>Look, anon. It has been established for a while that she specifically makes her magic not kill people and it's useless arguing about it now. Besides anyone who ever took a full force attack from her would be dead if it didn't.</br>  <br>How in the fuck did that " 're " get in there?<br>And you're logic is still shit, because you're comparing two characters from two different franchises that happen to both belong to the Mahou Shoujo genre.<br>Again, it's like saying Kouji or Ryoma could have done the job better as a critic against Shinji. It' doesn't work like that</br></br></br>  <br> They're experienced fighters <br>Yes, and experienced fighters usually have great control over their body and probably wouldn’t have a lot of problems picking up dancing. This whole “moves not just superhuman but not human at all” thing is utter bullshit and written in there as a convenience to make this completely out of character behavior somewhat understandable. <br><br> they had no problem killing innocent people <br>Are you retarded? Chris regretting her actions in the first season THAT DIDN’T EVEN KILL ANYONE is a major part of her character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some idiots constantly bring it up in comparison to Symphogear this season. It's dumb and they're really not comparable.<br><br>People on the internet are idiots who will argue about anything, go figure.</br></br></br>  <br>Pity reply</br>  <br>It might have been using attacks that weren't purely magical damage.</br>  <br>Who's more trustworthy, Elf9 or Ver?</br>  <br>Edgy Tsubasa.</br>  <br> These things only worked because Hibiki is Hibiki <br>I gave an example of how a different personality could have accomplished what she accomplished. Hibiki's personality isn't the only personality that exists that could have accomplished what she did. How do you not get this?<br><br><br> This whole “moves not just superhuman but not human at all” thing is utter bullshit and written in there as a convenience to make this completely out of character behavior somewhat understandable. <br>No you fucking moron, they fight otherworldly monstrosities on a regular basis, and they have human bodies themselves. They know what humans can do and what humans can't do. You can't just throw your judgement over theirs because it's convenient for your argument.<br><br> Are you retarded? <br>I was talking about the monstrosity dolls, you retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If any human moved and made the noises the dolls made, I'd fucking think they're possesed. <br>The Auto Scorers DO have non human movements, also normal humans can't kill people by kissing them</br></br>  <br>Elfnein looks like cute little girl. You wouldn't doubt in what cute little girl is saying, would you?</br>  <br> Taking a line from Strikers over what actually happened in the seasons that matter <br>Can't wait till they retcon that shit.</br></br>  <br> They know what humans can do and what humans can't do. <br>Hahahahahaha.</br></br>  <br>But everyone trust heroes, have you ever read a fairy tail?</br>  <br><br><br>I love the sound effects of her transformation, that scream when that star thing on her thighhighs appears.</br></br></br>  <br>And again, Ryoma and Kouji could have accomplished what Shnji accomplished, and Shinji 's personality isn't they only one that could have accomplished what he did. Yet, that's stupid criticism based on comparing different franchises. <br>Your Nanoha comparison is retarded, faggot</br></br>  <br> Genjuro <br> Human <br>He has the heart of a gentle God and the body of a war God. He's anything but human.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Genjuuro is a human </br>  <br>And that makes it fine to kill him, right?</br>  <br><br>No, he's human. he just eats, sleeps and watches action movies.</br></br>  <br>What actually happened?<br>When did Nanoha's magic ever kill anyone?<br>Non-lethal means it can't kill the enemy, but it still can hurt them, just not kill them</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're forgetting Miku Miku can put professionally train quarterbacks to shame without even trying.</br></br>  <br>Do you not see the fundamental flaw with what you're saying? No one said Shinji was the only person who could have solved problems presented in EVA because of his specific personality. Someone said that Hibiki's personality was necessary to solve the problems in Symphogear. That is objectively wrong.<br><br>You're telling me to not bring in other series when I just gave an example of a personality, and then you go and fucking bring up EVA when no one mentioned it and it has nothing to do with the fucking conversation. I hope you're trolling at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for you to keep deluding yourself into thinking that they're going to validate you at some point.</br>  Why Hibiki is such a bitch?  <br>If a completely inhuman beast is mercilessly killing innocent people, then yes you can fucking attack them without restraining yourself.</br>  <br> muh gungnir </br>  <br>No, because he hasn't hurt other people or caused unjustified destruction. Phara just killed one of the US guys with Maria, and was trying to kill her.<br>Leiur caused an entire building to catch fire. <br>Also, there's a thing called self defense. <br>The Auto Scorers attacked Tsubasa and Chris</br></br></br></br>   no cape <br> no KORT EL FES GUNGNIR <br>Goddamnit Satelite why do you get my hopes up like that only to-<br>Oh wait. Well fucking played.</br></br></br>  I felt like Miku should've convinced Hibiki that sometimes to help people you need to hurt people. Like how Hibiki saved her by fighting her, and that if she has to fight some human like dolls to protect the world than so be it. It would've been a better motivator.<br><br> just remember everything you've done <br>Das dumb.</br></br></br>  Is Carol the most adorable villain in anime?  <br> Das dumb. <br>So is Biki. That's why it worked.</br></br>  <br> my argument is being proved wrong <br> the guy must be trolling  <br>Sure. <br>I'm sure the person who said Hibiki's personality was necessary to solve the problems of Symphogear was comparing her with the personalities of other Symphogear characters. You just brought a character from another franchise into the argument because you're a retard</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was stated the cape was a manifestation of Maria hiding her doubts and insecurities. The fact she no longer has it is rather meaningful.</br>  Is Maria good at house chores or cooking?  Would she make a good wife for Tsubasa after Ogawa dies?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pl5<wbr>7hN4EaLU</wbr>  [ ]  <br>But it was cool. Couldn't it have just turned inside out or something?</br>  <br>She's pretty cute, but she's no  grape noise .</br>  <br> Miku literally told her "Just think about everything you've done and how it worked out." <br>Yes, and Miku is kind of an important person for Hibiki. <br><br> Having Hibiki be too stupid to pay attention to every action she's taken and how they've worked out is bad writing. <br>The only one not paying attention is you. This is not about stupidity, on a conscious level Hibiki knew all of that, this is about her emotions, and Miku arguably has more access to them than Hibiki herself. <br><br><br>But the dolls are human for the most part. Even more than their already pretty human looks suggest due to their origin from Carol. Killing a doll means killing a part of Carol. <br> killing innocent people <br>And that’s justification enough? I know America still has death sentences like some third world country, but even you guys have a trial before that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that instead of arguing, we could be eating some beef stroganoff.  <br>Can we argue about whether you actually can have beef stroganoff without beef?</br>  <br> was comparing her with the personalities of other Symphogear characters <br>You don't have to compare her to a set number of other characters, you fucking moron. She could have been different in a way that wasn't representative of any of the other characters in the show and things still would have worked out. Why are you so concerned with sloting things into existing and defined roles? Please tell me you're pretending to be stupid and not that you actually think you can only compare personalities under the lens of "If they're not X character then they have to be exactly like another character that we saw in their show."</br></br>  <br>Big jerks don't get to eat beef stroganoff.</br>  <br>You can.</br>  <br>I made beef stroganoff for dinner yesterday, does that count?</br>  <br>go to sleep carol</br>  <br> The only one not paying attention is you. <br> If we say the character has mental hangups then they don't need to have the slightest ounce of even basic self awareness! A character doesn't need to have human emotions, you can treat it all like a tool to move the plot even if it means turning them into a fucking characature of idealism, ignorance, and self pity <br>Yes, that's shitty writing. Read a fucking book.<br><br> But the dolls are human for the most part. <br>I can't believe I wasted my time responding to you.<br><br> And that’s justification enough?  <br>No, by all means don't use serious force against the super human monster because that's wrong. The dozens of innocent people that aren't in volved in the conflict that die are neither here nor there, as long as you don't attack the monster doll then you're standing on the moral high ground.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck do you turn a cape inside out, like do you wear it under your clothes or something?</br>  <br> Also, there's a thing called self defense. <br>And that would have been a much better excuse for going all out once they’ve established that the dolls can’t be talked into dropping their weapons or the situation demanded it. Which is pretty much what Hibiki tried to do if you think about it. <br><br>No one would fault them for killing someone in self defense or even defense of others, but it needs to be directly, there is no such thing as preemptively killing murderers because they might kill people the day after tomorrow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you a shitposter, or just retarded?</br>   Wild Arms music kicked in <br> still got her ass handed </br>  <br>truly best girl</br>  <br>Maria after retiring as Idol becomes Tsubasa manager.<br><br>It actually would be good future for both.<br><br>Ogawa can ninja out of the show into his family home and get forced to marry some off-screen japanese oujo-sama to become proper heir to his household.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm convinced you're both. "You can't compare aspects of peoples personalities, you can only say they're like X or Y character from their own series" is far and away the stupidest thing I've read on this board in a month.</br>  <br>Then just give her a different cape and incorporate some other metaphor for it.</br>  <br> shitty writing <br>That meme again. <br><br>And yes, believe it or not, the MINDS of the dolls are very much “human”, or sentient, whatever you may want to call it. We have human rights not because our bodies are so beautiful but because we protect the minds inhabiting them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably. She would make sure Tsubasa was eating well and organized for all of her idol appearances. She'd also be able to clean up after Tsubasa and manage her inability to put anything away. All while caring for and maintaining all of the little swords and daggers they have.<br><br>Maria is the perfect housewife.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you seriously trying to apply RL laws to shit on an action show because the protagonists attacked the villains? Are you retarded, or just a butthurt SJW?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VvV<wbr>k0L5lpZY</wbr>  [ ]<br>This will start playing when Chris activates her Ignition system and then fires off her banisher to annihilate the dolls.

It's people like you that make that shitty "you can't kill him , because you'll be like him" cliche continue to exist, you goddamned moralfag</br></br>  I don't even know what are we arguing about anymore.  <br>Any kind of cooking would be fine.<br>I fear for Tsubasa's health she's so skinny that it looks like she would break.<br>She didn't even eat anything with her date with Chris.<br><br>Have they even showed Tsubasa it any food because I can't remember.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That meme again. <br> Oh shit, I forgot I don't actually know anything about writing <br> Better fail to address anything he says by calling it a meme and then claiming the dolls are human <br><br><br>He's complaining about Americans because apparently murderous dolls are people and killing them is wrong, and his English sucks. He's not an SJW, he's probably some idiot from Sweeden who grew up playing with girls' toys.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People are showing how badass they are on the internet.</br>  <br>Swords don't eat.</br>  So when does Hibiki go full on Shadow the hedgehog edgy and fuck everything up in a 50 mile radius?  <br>Are you being serious right now? It was clearly a different colour on the inside.</br>  <br>What are you even saying, you retard?<br><br>There's a retard claiming the show to have "shit writing", then there's a moralfag, and the retard who had to bring Nanoha's personality to shit on Hibki without any reason. <br>My conclusion? Shitposters, all of them</br></br></br></br>  <br>*eat</br>  <br><br><br><br>I don’t care about the morals, I care about the characters and those characters just happen to have morals. I just expect a bit more than a five second remark as an excuse for them to kill somebody, especially since it’s a major development for a different character in the show. I’m more than fine with ignoring all of that, but then it should be ignored for all characters. Making one character an extreme moralfag while simultaneously ignoring that the others should have basic morals too is stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br> shit writing  <br> anything but a buzzword to shit on what you dislike, like edgy </br></br>  <br>I wish I was as cool and badass as you were. I bet just watching you fight would be like watching an action movie.</br>  <br> Swords don't eat <br>Not when she becomes an evil sword.</br></br>  <br> all of the little swords and daggers they have. <br> Airgetlam's armed gear is a dagger <br>Lewd</br></br></br>  <br> This character is poorly written because of the way their ignorance is portrayed, how it was presented and how they came to the realization of their own hubris and folly <br>Read my posts, you fucking moron. I explained what my problems were and you just decided to quote a single phrase then call it a buzzword because you're a retard that got triggered.</br></br>  <br>Shit, the first reply was for</br>  <br> Telling me to know which shitposts belong to which shitposter in an anonymous imageboard thread full of shitposting <br>Yeah , that's not how it works</br></br>  <br> if I use enough difficult words they won’t notice that it’s all just buzzwords </br>  <br>They should have some party and show all the gears eating. I don't know why but I really want to see it.</br>  <br>I really hope you don't think you've convinced anyone that your viewpoints regarding the dolls are even remotely grounded in any sort or reasonable eithic code.<br><br>You're literally saying that they shouldn't use real force against objectively inhuman tools created for the sole purpose of carrying out Carol's plan to destroy the world while willfully ignoring all the innocent people they've already killed. The fact that you would see innocent lives put in danger to show mercy to a literal monster absolutely disgusts me.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Wing Crying Wind and Christian Sound of Snow's time to go edgy evil.</br>  <br>I'm not that guy. You're just such a hilariously awful internet tough guy.</br>  <br>It's a direct fucking line of quotes.<br><br><br>Buzzword is a buzzword. Step it up.</br></br></br></br>   people here never had stress and shouted something that inmediatly regreted it <br>Fuck off, Hibiki isn't a bitch she is just having a bad time. Also, Maria called her arrogant so she was probably annoyed with her.</br>  <br> There's a retard claiming the show to have "shit writing", then there's a moralfag, and the retard who had to bring Nanoha's personality to shit on Hibki without any reason. <br><br>Threads are becoming worse and worse with every episode. I can't handle all those memes.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you mixing up the /m/ and /a/ thread, Symphofriend?</br>  <br>Miku said she knew that Hibiki's song could save people because she fought her and got saved through it. She proved to Hibiki that she could still save and not just hurt people by fighting them. If you read G-beat's full lyrics, you can clearly see how Miku's words affected her.</br>  <br> Look at me and how fucking cool and mature I am by insinuating that other people have a rash way of thinking <br> I don't need to actually put any real thought into the conversation or make an intelligent point, I can just make a snarky remark instead and sound clever! <br>Stop posting.</br></br></br>  I will post this every thread until it's back.  <br>Yes, that's exactly what you're doing. I'm glad you've realized it.</br>  <br>Still sad she didn't get a cool shield.</br>  <br>It's still shitposting and I shouldn't waste my time looking through the posts<br>Shit writing is an empty meaningless buzzword, like edgy, and no amount of justification changes that</br></br>  <br>Oh shit, I forgot that. Actually thinking about it flipping the cape inside out would probably be even more symbolic of her letting go of her Insecurities, almost like she's exposing her flaws to the world.</br>  <br><br>Summon a drawfag my heart can't take this.</br></br>  <br>You could easily just put the filename as <br> typical anime fan </br></br>  <br> It's still shitposting <br> Discussing the show is shitposting <br> Shit writing is an empty meaningless buzzword <br> no amount of justification changes that <br>You're literally being triggered by a word that directly fucking applies and has an explanation as to how it applies. Bravo. Deeming everything you disagree with to be a buzzword must really make having conversations simple.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chris has two kouhais and a homunculus now.</br></br>  Damn that fight scene, they sure know how to build the hype. Should have known Gungnir would get destroyed too, but the scene was so amazing I just wanted Hibiki to win.  <br>Chris is too young and poor for someone like Tsubasa.</br>  <br>I would will my soul if I could summon a drawfag successfully. I've never been able to before.</br>  <br>Maybe if we call Nana she'll will it.<br>Quick! Make this thread a Nana worship thread!</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa deserves someone better.</br>  <br>That's like making up some bullshit reason as to why a show is edgy, and saying edgy applies. <br>No matter how much bullshit you make up, Shit writing is a buzzword, empty and meaningless</br></br>  Why are people getting on to Hibiki right now for what she did? Didn't Tsubasa, Miku, Maria have similar problems the previous seasons? Tsubasa being an Ass to Hibiki, Miku getting angry at Hibiki for a government contracted secret in S1 and Maria being an absolute crybaby because of Serena in S2.  <br>Well, Hibiki was an ass to Tsubasa in S1 too.<br>She tried to replace her waifu, and that fucking triggered Tsubasa`s megautism.</br></br>  <br>It's not Hibiki's fault she's a baka.</br>  <br>Because whenever characters don't behave like robots in any series ever people always flip their shit. Just ignore it since most of it is just people using it to shitpost now anyway.</br>  Genjuro will probably pummel a couple dolls once they don't have access to Alcanoises, and it will be glorious.  <br> bullshit you make up <br> Refernce the show and explain what you're saying <br> bullshit you make up <br>I didn't know it was even possible to just dismiss anything someone says like that. I'm impressed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like how Maria acted after Bikkie bitched at her. She said just enough to push Bikkie a little bit forward in her development, but without getting angry at her. She realized Bikkie didn't meant to act like retard. She may not be able to help her, but she certainly know how to not fuck things up. Man, GX is doing great job at making characters more interesting and likeable.</br>  <br>Because it's now popular enough to attract idiots and shitposters.</br>  <br>You're going to have to post that every thread and then watch it endlessly get countered with Tsubasa and Maria art.</br>  <br>If only all of us could be as mature as Maria now.</br>  <br>I liked how Maria took the JAM without either turning to charcoal or blurbing something about SAKIMORI and falling down.</br>  Grape-kun Tsubasa-vision.  <br> Tsubasa being an Ass to Hibiki <br>This was presented because Hibiki tried to take the place of her dead waifu like an idiot.<br><br> Miku getting angry at Hibiki for a government contracted secret <br>Miku gets mad because Hibiki keeps literally everything from her. Anything Miku feels is completely justified, and everything she does is to try to help Hibiki and get closer to her.<br><br> Maria being an absolute crybaby because of Serena <br>Her sister died, her childhood was shit, she was tricked and used. She then realized that and started doing her best to attone for her actions.<br><br>What's the problem with any of those?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She tried to replace her waifu <br>No she didn't. Stop being a retard.</br></br>  <br>You mean Nanavision.<br>Nana fucking loves Ninja and Samurais.</br></br>    <br> Don't worry Tsubasa-san I'll take Kanade's place! </br>  <br> because Hibiki tried to take the place of her dead waifu like an idiot. <br>No she didn't. Stop being a retard.</br></br>  <br>Watch the first few episodes of S1 again. You'll know why Tsubasa was so buttblasted.</br>  <br>His point is that Hibiki is justified in doing what she's doing just like they were, anon. They were mistakes but everyone gets emotional and makes mistakes.</br>  <br><br>My bad.</br></br>  <br>She literally says "I will do my best to replace Kanade" Did you even watch the first season?</br>  <br>Pix</br>  <br>To be fair she didn't zesshou.</br>  <br> What's the problem with any of those? <br>The point is there's no problem with them just like there's no problem with Hibiki now yet people keeps shiting on her.</br></br>  <br>Please leave and watch season one and two and don't return to discuss the show until you have.</br>  <br> What's the problem with any of those? <br>That's the point - there's no problem at all. Same with what Bikkie's doing now, and yet people are angry about it for no reason.</br></br>  <br><br><br> &lt;Xythar&gt; though if i was subbing this from the start it probably would've been ame-no-habakiri <br> &lt;Xythar&gt; not like we tl the other relic names <br><br>An unfortunate commitment to consistency, paired with a poor translation decision 3 years ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Give me a time reference</br>  <br>She says that verbatim you fucking retard.<br><br><br> His point is that Hibiki is justified in doing what she's doing just like they were, anon. <br>All of those are reasonable traumas that were presented, then the character interacted with people around them and grew from their experiences. Hibiki remained static for over 2 season, and the root of her problem was "I don't want to hurt people." She somehow managed to make it 2 full seasons without realizing that she didn't have to kill people any time she engaged in conflict with them, and that punching someone to stop a rampage then trying to reach them with words helps them in the long run. She shut out every person and ignored all of the events around her. The entire crux of her character is "I'm an idiot."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Give me a time reference.</br>  Gary &gt; Micky &gt; Pharrel &gt; Larry  please stop making me love garie<br>she's going to die and I'll be sad</br>  <br> Can't remember how events happened <br> Has the gall to try and correct other people about the show <br>Amazing.</br></br></br>  This is some great art<br>1/3</br>  <br>You also somehow managed to go 2 full seasons without paying attention to her character but you don't see me shitting up every thread by calling you a retard.</br>  <br> Please spoonfeed me so I can continue to discuss the show pretending I know anything about it. <br><br>No thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>2/3</br>  <br>But why don't you give me a time reference?</br>  This show is so fucking stupid but so damn fun.<br>makes me want to pick up the old seasons</br>  <br>3/3</br>  <br> You also somehow managed to go 2 full seasons without paying attention to her character <br>What the hell does this even mean? I just gave a rundown of all the characters, where their trauma stemmed from and how it was presented and then solved. You didn't like how I said Hibiki's happened and your response is that I wasn't paying attention? That only works when someone actually didn't watch the show like the guy asking when Hibiki said she'd replace Kanade. You can't just tell people they didn't watch the show when they're actually discussing the events and you haven't said a damn thing that holds any weight.</br></br>  <br> watching the 3rd season without having watched the first two <br><br>Fuck, what are you doing? Go watch S1 and S2 now and don't come back until you finished.</br></br></br>  ob<br>Those “objectively inhuman tools” banter with their master and are clearly shown to have personalities. It’s easy to dismiss anyone without a human body as inhuman but things already get difficult once you think about transhumanism, a topic Symphogear has already broached with Fine, or heck even Hibiki herself. The characters have never taken a stance against it unless you count Hibiki’s Gungnir cancer being a bad thing. (They were mostly focused on the result of her dying and less on her becoming inhuman) Even if your philosophical stance differs, you have to acknowledge that Chris or Tsubasa dismissing dolls as subhuman needs an explanation.<br><br>Which I by the way still don’t think they do, this was just glossed over to make the plot progress faster.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody has to cover for your own ignorance.</br>  <br> human skin tone instead of pale as fuck <br>That somehow looks more disturbing than ordinary Garie.</br></br>  <br>Garie seemed pretty damn yandere and jealous of having to work with Micha.<br>She's also the youngest so her personality is probably the most developed.</br></br>  <br> Hibiki remained static for over 2 season, and the root of her problem was "I don't want to hurt people." <br>The core of her problems is "I'm not allowed to live if I hurt anyone, so I need to save whoever I can".</br></br>  <br>By your logic a computer program that's designed to spit out witty retorts could be considered human even if at it's core it didn't have a range of complex human emotions and wasn't capable of empathy.</br>  <br>I'm starting to think that's where their names really do come from.</br>    <br> Genjuuro and Ogawa tag team match against the entire stable Carol has assembled with the Dolls and Edgy geahs <br><br>Bah gawd, King.</br></br></br>  <br> I need to save people to have worth as a person <br> Through fighting with the Symphogear, I saved Chris and Miku and Fine <br> Other enemies have appeared that are killing innocent people that per my own words I want to save <br> Despite my past experiences, I can't see how it would be a good idea to put my armor and and engage in some sort of confrontation, knowing full well that I don't have to kill or even seriously injur them, I just have to stop them from killing people and rampaging until I'm able to try and reach them with my words <br>She doesn't learn, she's static. They completely sidestepped her development and explained it with "She's really stupid."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ignore him. it's the same guy from the last thread.</br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  <br>Perfect taste.</br>  <br> even if at it's core it didn't have a range of complex human emotions <br>No. My entire point is that the dolls could have them. And they probably do since they’re made out of parts from Carol herself. In a way you could consider them as very advanced humans transplanted into robot bodies.</br></br>  <br> The dolls could have empathy <br> The dolls who indiscriminantly suck peoples memories out, light buildings on fire, kill little animals and are on a quest to save the world could have empathy <br>Ok.</br></br></br>  How about that whistling though.  <br> on a quest to save the world <br>destroy the world*<br>Sorry, it's late.</br></br></br>  <br>You fucking bet. Anon Sleeps and eats, too, so you had better step off.</br>  <br>Humans supposedly having empathy has never stopped them from being horrible either.</br>  <br> Everyone on the show acknoledged the dolls are inhuman monsters <br> I'm going to argue for their humanity to shit on the show <br>Please stop, shitposter-kun<br>Go read western comics if you want your heroes to not kill their enemies</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chris was befriended by Genjuro. Bikkie befriended Fine with the power of being naive and cute. Miku was indeed saved in fight, but Hibiki was more focused on fact that Miku saved her. And realization about that fight was major point of Bikkie's development in GX ep 4, right?<br>There's also thing that really doesn't fit into Hibiki's previous experience - Carol was crying. That's a big deal.</br></br>  <br> Everyone on the show acknoledged the dolls are inhuman monsters <br>Yes, in a rather out of character way in five seconds. They could do better. <br> if you want your heroes to not kill their enemies <br>But I do. I’d just prefer it if they killed someone they acknowledged as human instead of something dismissed as a doll.</br></br></br></br>  <br> they’re made out of parts from Carol herself <br><br>And as a result Carol would've ensured that any parts of compassion or empathy didn't get included.</br></br></br>  <br>And in Symphogear whenever someone has empathy you can see it in their actions and how they reflect on them. The wonderful thing about fiction is that the author can present the story how they want. Chris and Maria did some bad things, but we could see how they struggled with them. The dolls have no such struggle, and are stated by every character to be monsters.</br>  <br> Chris was befriended by Genjuro. Bikkie befriended Fine with the power of being naive and cute. Miku was indeed saved in fight, but Hibiki was more focused on fact that Miku saved her. And realization about that fight was major point of Bikkie's development in GX ep 4, right? <br>And yet there was still a conflict with every one of them before they were saved. The conflict didn't kill them or cripple them for life, it just stopped their rampage and spared some innocent people until a solution could be reached through some other means. Hibiki was there for all of this, and learned from none of it.<br><br> Carol was crying <br>So were the kids inside the building she set on fire. I bet the people in the helicopter and those guys walking outside were on the verge of tears during their final moments, too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shitty 10-minute attempt in gimp. The collar is amazing but the rest is eh. You'd also have to recolour like half her fucking design to get something usable.<br>Had to use waifu2x on the original image because holy jesus fuck that was a lot of artefacting.</br></br>  <br>Remember when she beat the shit out of those kids.</br>  <br> out of character <br>Nothing with that level of strength can be human, and don't bring up Genjuuro because he's an exception. Also, Tsubasa aknolowedged that even her bigass sword attack was not enough to kill Phara<br>Stop shitposting.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember when those kids were shooting 2hu lasers at her and sending dolls out to kill people with the end goal of destroying the world?</br>  <br> And as a result Carol would've ensured that any parts of compassion or empathy didn't get included. <br>We even speculated about them betraying Carol and they already tease her now, I don’t think that was her intention when making them. This indicates that they have more complete personalities than you think they do.<br><br><br>Just like Ver showed no such struggle and hence was deemed subhuman and killed, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Just like Ver showed no such struggle and hence was deemed subhuman and killed, right? <br>Are you saying that if Ver was as strong as Genjuro and was running amok killing people, they shouldn't have used lethal force on him?</br></br>  <br>But anon, not killing Ver is the more cruel option.</br>  <br> rotten to the core <br>Is Garie a fujoshit?</br></br>  <br>No, just that they’d better have the characters seriously reflect about killing a sentient being. Or that they’d cut down on the moralfaggotry in general but you can’t have it both ways.</br>  <br>Actually, I've watched the first season 7-8 time.<br>I don't remember such line so I want to make sure it's not some Commie fuck up.<br>You guys claim it did happen, so you're the only ones who can point me to when she said it.<br><br>I remember Hibiki maybe saying she'll fill the place in the team, but not that she'll replace Kanade, so I want to check that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> have the characters seriously reflect about killing a sentient being. <br> Hyper powered monster kills a bunch of people in front of you then attacks you <br> Better hold back just in case, even after you've determined that anything less than a really assault won't hurt it </br></br></br>  <br>It's right after Genjuuro punches Heaven's Wrath.</br>  <br> watched the first season 7 or 8 times <br> doesn't remember the line before Tsubasa bitch slaps Hibiki <br><br>Did you happen to fall asleep each time you watched the episodes? She even mentions it more than once about replacing Kanade.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fight against Chris was the only case when Bikkie fought against human enemy for reason other than Miku, and she couldn't learn anything from it because fight was interrupted and next time they saw each other was after Genjuuro and Miku befriended Chris. <br><br> So were the kids inside the building she set on fire. I bet the people in the helicopter and those guys walking outside were on the verge of tears during their final moments, too. <br><br>That's kinda point. She want to save Carol as much as she want to save those kids. You don't punch crying little girl you want to save, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she does say it after that, but Tsubasa was trying to kill her -before- she said that.<br>That's my point.<br><br><br>This goes for you too.<br>Can you pin point another time?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fight Chris, Chris doesn't die <br> Fight Miku, Miku doens't die <br> Fight Fine, Fine doesn't die in battle <br> Don't fight Carol, she will kill people <br>If you want to save them both then there's an answer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but<br> Fight Chris, She's wearing super tough regenerating armor <br> Fight Miku, spends the entire fight trying not to hit her and just stalls until she can throw her into the beam <br> Fights Fine, just taps her even though she tries to destroy the world </br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you only looking at half of the answer.<br>Yes, she fought with them (mostly to save Miku), but Carol is the only one to actually show how vulnerable she is. She cried. Also, when Bikkie first met Carol she didn't knew how much of a threat Carol is, and she was too shocked to fight when she found out her dolls are killing people.</br></br>  <br>And the dolls are durable enough to take on Chris and Tsubasa head to head. What's your point?</br>  <br> Tsubasa was trying to kill her -before- she said that. <br>Because she was wearing her dead waifu's gear, hence in Tsubasa's eyes trying to replace her<br><br> can you pinpoint a time <br>Well if you've seen the series so much its when Hibiki is talking to Ogawa after Tsubasa is in the hospital. You should know when that is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dolls aren't going to stop if you punch their clothes off.</br>  <br> hence in Tsubasa's eyes trying to replace her <br>Exactly my point. She was an ass to her BEFORE Hibiki said anything.<br>Thank you very much.<br><br> when Hibiki is talking to Ogawa after Tsubasa is in the hospital <br>That's also after Tsubasa was trying to kill her. Actually, it's just before Hibiki activated her true befriending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Carol is the only one to actually show how vulnerable she is. She cried <br>She knew something was up with Chris, she obviously knows Miku, and they learned about Fine.<br><br> Also, when Bikkie first met Carol she didn't knew how much of a threat Carol is <br>And then Carol started shooting tornadoes and sending killer dolls after people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can knock them out or restrain them. They aren't so fragile that a punch is going to break them.</br>  <br>Are you really unable to comprehend the idea that it might be hard for someone like Hibiki to fight and potentially kill someone with your bare hands? Are you a sociopath? Are you saying that you'd be so much better in that situation?</br>  <br> Better hold back <br>No one said that. Reflection can work without direct (in)action too and self defense alone is a more than sufficient enough reason to go all out, not to mention that it was the dolls who initiated the conversations, it wouldn’t have been putting any of the gears at a particular disadvantage to ask a question or two somewhere inbetween. The episodes so far ignored this a bit too much and that would have been fine if this whole thing wasn’t such a major issue for Hibiki, they should have shown how other characters deal (or don’t deal) with it. Maybe they still intend to, who knows.</br></br>  <br> someone <br>They aren't people.<br><br> and potentially kill <br>They aren't made of paper mache and glass.<br><br> Are you a sociopath <br>No, the screams of the children trapped in the fire, and helicopter that crashed would bother me on a fundamental level. That's why I'd try and stop it from happening again.<br><br> Are you saying that you'd be so much better in that situation? <br>If I had Gungnir? Absolutely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Exactly my point. She was an ass to her BEFORE Hibiki said anything. <br>Except all the times she was all "let me fight with you I have no idea what you've been through and I have no training but your waifu died and I have her gear so accept me and let me replace Kanade" Hibiki acted with the intention of replacing Kanade, she just didn't voice it till then. Anyone with a brain could tell that was what she was doing. <br><br> Thank you very much <br>Anon you had to be fucking spoonfed through this entire pointless argument</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure you would.</br>  <br>I was talking about Hibiki, not Chris. Also, Commie translations suck and you shouldn't base your understanding of the characters on that. Either learn moon or wait for H&amp;D.</br>  <br>When Bikkie was talking with Carol not a single person was in danger. What's the big deal with shooting alchemic tornadoes if they won't hurt anyone?</br>  <br>No. Blue, red, green, yellow.</br>  <br>The first encounter let Biki know they were dangerous and aggressive. As soon as she saw Garie in the town with a bunch of dead guys near her she should have done something.<br><br>And even the first time they were near the buliding. Hell, there was a guy right behind Carol that Garie killed so clearly people could have been caught up in that attack.</br></br></br>   people are still responding to shitposting <br>C'mon now.</br>  <br>She only had the intention of fighting for the team, trying to save human kind. Tsubasa was hating her nonetheless. Only later on she said anything about Kanade, but that was after Tsubasa was being a complete ass to her.<br><br>Also, it's not spoonfeeding when you claim something exist and I tell you it doesn't. You're the one who has to point where it is.</br></br></br>  <br> People are discussing the events of the show <br> HEY GUYS STOP SHITPOSTING! <br>People having a different opinion than you doesn't equate to shitposting.</br></br></br>  <br>I’ve watched all versions of course and in this case there just isn’t a lot of difference. <br> I was talking about Hibiki, not Chris. <br>Hibiki wasn’t holding back either, she delayed the fight with talking (the right thing to do in my eyes and certainly the most in character of all the reactions) and what she would have done beyond that we don’t really know. It didn’t look like she was holding back against Micha at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Her name is Scyther</br>  <br>Not him, but Tsubasa didn't like her at first and then Hibiki made it unequivocally worse by saying the stupidest thing she could have.<br><br> Also, it's not spoonfeeding when you claim something exist and I tell you it doesn't. You're the one who has to point where it is. <br>The entire fucking thread told you that you were wrong and it's a commonly discussed plot point. Get check for Alzheimer's.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsubasa was hating her nonetheless. <br>Tsubasa was acting normally to her as everyone else. She was equally as cold to Ogawa and the rest of div 2 because that was her personality post Kanade. It got worse with Hibiki the moment she said she wanted to fight with Tsubasa and replace Kanade.</br></br>  <br> but Tsubasa didn't like her at first <br>My point.<br><br> The entire fucking thread told you that you were wrong <br>But I am right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and in this case there just isn’t a lot of difference. <br>One implies that she won't reflect on it and feel bad afterwards no matter what happens, the other acknowledges her opponent fighting on an equal level which means even if she fights in earnest it won't kill her opponent. How are those the same?<br><br> Hibiki wasn’t holding back either, <br>She absolutely was until the last 5 minutes of this weeks episode.<br><br> It didn’t look like she was holding back against Micha at least. <br>Her development and resolve were bashed over our heads. You know that line in her song about her resolve (literally "my unwavering-ness") being wrapped up in her fist? It's time for that.<br><br>Also, even then she wasn't going all out. She didn't go maximum infinity sync rate and use her super mountain breaking pile bunker.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Scenario: Nana didn't will it and Symphogear is on it's last season. What kind of epilogue do you want for everyone?  <br>NINJA THROW CAR LIKE SHIRIKEN WHILE DRIVING</br>  <br>This. Tsubasa's soul was killed when she saw Kanade died, she became cold to everyone after the incident.<br>Note that Ogawa said "Did you change, or did someone change you" after/before the date episode IIRC.</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa was acting normally to her as everyone else <br>She was literally trying to kill her. That was BEFORE Hibiki said anything.<br><br> It got worse with Hibiki the moment she said she wanted to fight with Tsubasa and replace Kanade. <br>It actually got better, because not only she wasn't trying to kill her again, it was right before they finally became friends.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My point. <br>What point? Tsubasa was initially cold towards her. Given her situation, that wasn't a big deal. After that, Hibiki said the most abrasive and offensive thing she could have and she said it completely nonchalantly. After that any friction between them is on her.<br><br> But I am right. <br>No you're not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Tsubasa finally becomes happy.</br>  <br> But I am right. <br>Holy fucking shit you said Hibiki never tried to replace Kanade and we showed you she said exactly that.</br></br>  <br> As soon as she saw Garie in the town with a bunch of dead guys near her she should have done something. <br><br>She tried, but couldn't. She was too shocked too act, which in turn confused her. It was the first time she messed up that badly by not hurting anyone. It's the first time she needs to go into fight with determination to hurt, otherwise she can't save anyone. Miku then reminds Bikkie that she saved her by fighting. That's all. This problem is solved. Nothing really out of place happened, everything is consistent and makes enough sense. Now we can move on to her different problems.</br></br></br>  <br> Nana didn't will it  <br>Impossible. Nana really loves Symphogear.</br></br>  <br>Shit posters shit posting for the sole goal of a (You)<br><br>Just report and ignore them already. Its pretty simple to do.</br></br></br>  <br>I was saying she wasn't. <br>You said she out right says it, and that's why Tsuabsa was an ass to her.<br>Tsuabasa was an ass to her BEFORE she said it.<br><br>Why is it so hard to fathom?</br></br></br></br></br>   I don't want to use my power to hurt people because is to save people <br> I know your power is to help people not to hurt people <br> You are right! <br><br>Is everyone in this show becoming more dumb or just more oblivious</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, even then she wasn't going all out. She didn't go maximum infinity sync rate and use her super mountain breaking pile bunker. <br>She could only do that because she was singing with Chris and Tsubasa and got triple the amount of phonic gain.</br></br>  <br>Am I the only one who finds Micha similar to Charlotte?</br>  <br>For one, she never properly processed her fight with Shenshou Jing Miku in her head.</br>  Talking about how Tsubasa was cold as fuck in S1 to Bikki really fucks up these these threads.  <br> As soon as she saw Garie <br> She tried, <br>No she didn't.<br><br> Miku then reminds Bikkie that she saved her by fighting <br>That's the problem. All Miku said was "Hey, these things happened." and then Hibiki said "Oh yeah, they did happen. I'm better now."<br><br> Now we can move on to her different problems. <br>Her stupidity wrapped up in idealism put behind a wall of isolation from her friends IS her problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She could only do that because <br>No. Her canon power is literally that she can will her sync ratio up as high as she needs to.</br></br>  <br> graduated <br> successful international singer <br> lots of supportive friends and kouhais <br> lovely wife <br>What more could she want?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So did we figure out what dance she uses while idle?</br>  So as someone who never downloads commie and wants to start this from the beginning, how Commie is this translation? Can I expect memes, localization, and god tier typesetting and editing?  <br>Revival of her best friend.<br>Notice that her smiles are still half-hearted despite having everything.</br></br>  <br>No real memes, some minor localisation, and yes.</br>  <br>What if Genjuuro is actually a Custodian who fell in love with humanity?</br>  <br>They do mess up some translations, but aside from that it's one of their better releases.</br>  <br> How are those the same? <br>The intention behind it is pretty much the same. I wouldn’t take a line such as the one Commie used at face value even if that was exactly what she said but I guess due to context it seemed like that was what I was trying to say. Also, the next line. <br><br> She absolutely was until the last 5 minutes of this weeks episode. <br>When I hear holding back I think of “fighting but not with full strength”, not of deliberately delaying fights or not being able to fight.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3/commie</br>  <br> minor localisation <br>Let's not start this.<br><br><br> Genjuro is the surrogate father to humanity and wants to protect all of his children <br>I would be 200% ok with that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was believing that she wouldn't be able to save Carol if she fight her. Miku pointed out that she still can save her even through fighting just like how she saved Miku. <br>Hibiki was too focused on how Miku erased her relic cancer back then that she didn't acknowledge that she was able to save Miku through fighting.</br></br>  <br> You said she out right says it, and that's why Tsuabsa was an ass to her. <br>She does outright say that, and Tsubasa continues to hate her because Hibiki was an idiot to say that. Though I think you're confusing me with another anon, I was simply trying to show you from the start that Hibiki does say she will replace Kanade.<br><br> She tried to replace her waifu <br> No she didn't. Stop being a retard. <br>That's what you said. And we showed you specifically that Hibiki says she will replace Kanade.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Genjuro is Apollonius, before he turned into a dick <br><br>SASUGA FUDO'S LITTLE BROTHER</br></br>  <br> The intention behind it is pretty much the same <br>I completely disagree. As someone who translates stuff, those two lines carry very different intents.<br><br>  it seemed like that was what I was trying to say. <br>I'm glad you can see how I got that idea.<br><br> Also, the next line.  <br>It was just along the lines of "Don't be a sore loser." A boast of confidence.<br><br> When I hear holding back I think of “fighting but not with full strength” <br>But she was doing that, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Her stupidity wrapped up in idealism put behind a wall of isolation from her friends IS her problem. <br><br>This pretty much sums Bikki problems. She is not idealist or naive, she is just dumb.<br><br>I like characters with moral conflicts but here there is no conflict at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dunno. I kinda like that Genjuro is normal human but with bullshit power to deny any logic. Explaining it by saying he's Custodian kills that fun. Still, it wouldn't be bad I guess.</br>  <br> I like characters with moral conflicts <br>I'm fine with a moral conflict when it doesn't boil down to hyper idealism and cognitive dissonance like Biki shows. You need to have some sense of pragmatism and rational to do a good moral conflict.<br><br>The thing is that Kaneko wrote WA2 and granted that was in a different medium, it fully explored what it means to be a hero and fight and what the hero's worth to society is. It was a fucking masterpiece on all fronts involving writing.</br></br></br></br>  I hid only hid two posts in the entire thread.<br>You guys really need to chill.</br>   Dat fucking over the top music when Micha is chasing them <br><br>There could have been a better place for that OST.</br></br>  So...how long before alchemist-chan realizes the wrong of her ways and that she missunderstood her papa that didn't want to destroy the world at all and blue starts to act (more) crazy and acts on her own?<br><br>This season is so predictable that anyone could write it with the eyes closed</br></br>  Hard mode: No reposts.  <br>It even has a wiki.<br><br>http://keitai-project.wikia.com/wik<wbr>i/Keit-Ai_Project_Wiki</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>And? Its okay in moderation</br>  <br>What do you think this is a children's show, of course she does</br>  An Umineko anime would be fucking awesome, right guys?  Full length version of this.<br><br> http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/<br>sm22239389</br> </br></br>  anyone got anime recomendations for a anime newbie?<br> pic unrelated </br>  dota 2  Boko no Pico  <br>Boku no Pico</br>  <br>Fuck off and kill yourself.</br>  I recommend getting a better hobby.  Would you stick your dick in crazy?  <br>I cant find this name anywhere, someone pls help</br>  <br>The evidence is mounting.</br>    <br> couldn't even win against canada </br>  <br>Then England must be absolute shit, right?</br>  4 &gt;<br>5 &gt;<br>7 &gt;<br>6 &gt;<br>3 &gt;<br>1 &gt;<br>2<br><br>Do you agree?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Meant to respond to this. I'm drunk.</br></br>  <br>I feel kind of similar, though it depends whether part 8, which i just started reading elaborates on what happened johny</br>  <br>Love interest for jojo, except unlike Erina or Suzy-q he actually has some decent fight scenes</br>  <br><br>It felt more fun than most of the other parts. Part 3 was way too serious through the whole thing. Sure it had some silly moments, like the Mariah fight, but those were few and far between. On the other hand part 4 was so full of fun bits that I can't even remember most of them. <br><br> Josuke beating Aqua Necklace because he swallowed a glove <br> Yukako kidnapping Koichi and making him eat shredded dictionaries <br> Cheap Trick <br>Josuke and Okuyasu trying to get rich quick with Shigecchi<br> "I am an Alien" <br><br>It also had really cool serious fights as well, like everything involving Kira. I liked Shigecchi's Harvest more than DIO's World (widely considered the best part of SC), just because it felt more fun, and bizarre.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  (8 so far, feel free not to count this) &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 6 &gt; 7 &gt; 5 &gt; 1 &gt; 3  Will you do it if you get the note?
