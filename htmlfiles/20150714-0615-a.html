[ Ask Donald any anime questions  Will Nichibros get a second season?  <br>Is OP going to get a (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)?</br>  Kaiji S3?  <br>MODS</br>  <br> no <br><br>T-thanks donald</br></br></br>  New episode soon    <br> Don't listen to the french guy. <br>Fuck off<br><br><br>still not as good as in the manga. The ost is also not that good</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, the manga's OST was better.</br>  The ugly manga art must be the only thing going for this series if people are still this upset over it.  <br>"not-the-manga/10" aside, what was wrong with the ost exactly?<br>The first episode seemed to have had pretty decent sound direction. It was probably one of the more notable aspects of the anime to me.</br></br>  What does /a/ think of this series?  I hate it.<br>I can't stop watching.</br>  <br> It seems like they don't have proofs enough to send them all to jail <br>Raku's father gave Marika's father his scar in the first place, that seems to me like evidence enough for arrest.<br>Not to mention, the criminals never bother hiding their guns, they carry them out in the open (and in Tsugumi and Paula's case to school). One search warrant is all you need to arrest the fuck out of all of them since guns are illegal in Japan</br></br></br>  <br>Keep telling that to yourself, Raku.</br>  Has soem good NTR doujin.      <br> just found the BD specials to be utterly revolting. <br>Zerofags everyone.</br></br>  <br> do you like men? <br>Depends on the person.<br><br>I love all good-looking human bodies, though the feminine form tends to arouse me more, instinctively.<br><br><br>T R I G G E R E D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You talk like a fag</br>  <br>You can start off killing yourself, frogposting shithead.</br>  What were the DB specials anyways? I have no idea and google only gives me a million blu ray advertisements.  So NT13 getting translated when?  <br> his teeth regenerate <br> turns out Aleister stuffed them full of dragons too <br> most of the series would have been a cakewalk if he just bit people like Index </br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Would you rather Accelerator just knock him out and a surprise Misaki saves him with an Othinus memory wipe</br>  <br>Gunha got trashed by a girl, he's weak as fuck. <br><br>At least shiage and accel been putting bitches on lock.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure?<br>He looks fine to me?</br></br>  Gather around, /a/. Let me tell you the story of Claw Girl.  Why are so many moeblobs among the most powerful characters in the anime/manga/vn/ln medium?  <br>Enma Ai should be in Special Tier she can't do shit without someone elses hatred.</br>  <br>Nope, and you have no proof whatsoever.</br>  <br><br>Samefag, why are you here?<br><br> Asking for proof <br>Why don't you play the VN yourself?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah she's old as fuck she was mentioned in a couple paragraphs in some of the side materials since she was a backround element that had nothing to do with the main plot.</br>  <br>I don't need to, japanese VN authors don't decide what omnipotent means. The fact that you think they do only confirms your stupidity.</br>  Is monday you cucklords and you know what that means.<br><br> BOKU GIRL THREAD <br><br>Also, the last week we haven't live translation because Aereus got cucke'd and there is no raws (at least the last week) so what is going on with chapters 70-71-72? can Giratina save our dicks with his/her translations?</br></br></br></br>       tfw Aereus will never return from the 3 week store   <br>Without hesitation.</br>  <br>Seriously he's been afk for week, is he dead or raped by niggers?</br>  Papi is a harpy!  <br>Why do you think only wanting to fuck one person somehow cancels out having loose sexual morals.</br>  <br>Whatever you say.</br>  <br>Are you implying every 2D girl has the same behavior she has? Because if you are, I ask the same question to you.</br>  <br>Different people fall in love for different reasons<br><br>It's perfectly acceptable for her to fall in love with him for being genuinely nice to her<br><br>That's also one the reasons Rachnee loves Darling<br><br><br>Uh, no<br>Because if a male tries to fuck on the first date then no one is going to call him on it<br><br><br>Where has she been shown to have loose sexual morals?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  These threads have the same arguments<br><br>1) Is Miia a slut or not?<br>2) Why Cerea is trash/not trash<br>3)Why Rachnee is best girl<br><br>These 3 arguments happen in every thread without fail<br><br>Just 2 more to go boys</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Get in here and discuss why Hana is  the most entertaining girl, in my honest opinion. <br><br>Other boys and girls are welcome too.</br></br>  <br>I gagged when this happened. She can't breathe because how bad it smells.</br>  I thought Hana was a crazy bitch at first<br>But then I found out that she was the crazy bitch I always wanted.<br><br>She better win.</br></br></br>  <br>I would imagine so with the amount she fucking sweats. Its niagara falls of sweat with that woman fucking everywhere.</br>  <br>BD and Blu-ray announced<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zKG<wbr>bxDo8X0Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I'm a bit curious about posts like that, what is it about hana that makes her go from "crazy bitch" to "crazy bitch you wanted"?</br>  Another SAO CLONE adapted into anime?? <br>Will this stop one day?<br><br>http://otakomu.jp/archives/278290.h<wbr>tml<br><br>Suddenly high school student Subaru Natsuki has been summoned to another world on the way back from the convenience store. With the biggest crisis of his life being summoned to another world and no sign of the one who summoned him, things become worse when he is attacked. But when he is saved by a mysterious silver-haired girl with a fairy cat, Subaru cooperates with the girl to return the favor. When they finally manage to get a clue, Subaru and the girl are attacked and killed by someone. Subaru then awakens in the place he was summoned and notices he gained the ability "Returns by Death." A helpless boy that only has the ability to rewind time by dying. And beyond the despair can he save the girl from the fate of death?</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Seeing as it's just s subset of being summoned to another world I could say something like El Hazard, Aura Battler Dunbine. Monster Rancher, Escaflowne, Those who hunt elves, Now and then, Here and there.</br>  <br>Also, there's no need to be so defensive. I know you feel offended but c'mon, grow up.</br>  <br>It's not, they're stuck in a video game</br>  <br>The only person who needs to grow up is yourself.</br>  <br> does not know glorious "la caverna di Platone" </br>  How's it feel seeing your husbando for the first time in like weeks and then he gets raped by the KINGU, Yuzu?  <br>There have been other Atem face moments. I don't have the picture but:<br> Atem made to date Anzu <br> "Y-Yugi, this isn't a duel!" <br> Turns to Anzu, "h-hello..." </br></br></br></br>  <br>Senet is the worst idea Konami ever had, they've even admited it</br>  <br> mfw Iwata's dead </br>  <br>Yusi only has 3 facial expressions: normal, smiling and angry</br>    List of pleb tier seiyuu you should be ashamed of for liking:<br><br>1. Hanakana<br>2. Amamiya Sora<br>3. Sakura Ayane<br>4. Uchida Maaya</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That third wheel Uchiyama</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p1J<wbr>aAXdKZhA</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Is Ayaneru and Ucchi the new Kayanon and Matsuoka pairing that fans are trying to push?</br>  Tell me your Top 5  cutest  seiyuu.  <br>Once again proving /a/ doesn't fucking read. The link was actually talking about how that guy hires the same people for tons of shows for a few years then dumps them for a new bunch when they start getting paid more, with an anecdotal mention of how this resulted in that tabloid rumour. (why they didn't go with Ai Kayano when she appeared even more suddenly and without such an obvious backstory as to why as Taneda is beyond me)<br><br>He's the reason people bitch about Matsuoka being in everything right now, really, and also the reason Kayano/Matsuoka casting keeps actually happening.</br></br></br>  ITT: immeasurable sex appeal  <br>anon pls</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128007312#p128030829">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>only superior in NO TSUN, ALL DERE</br>    <br>worst taste in thread, as always.</br>  Do people actually find this dogshit funny?

Here's another facet. <br><br>Taihei represents what little morals the nips still have, he tries to bring Umaru back to reality but as we know, panderers will pander and will continue to spew a stream of huggy shit to distract the nips from their spiraling doom.</br></br></br>  <br> people arrive at /a/ and magically change their entire behavior and take on qualities unique to the entire internet <br><br>just love this meme.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep in mind that japanese people have a very primitive sense of humor. Like a baby that thinks bright lights and strange sounds are funny. <br><br>I don't know why western weabs watch this shit though.</br></br></br>  <br>Your continued existence on this mortal coil you faggot.</br></blockquote>]
