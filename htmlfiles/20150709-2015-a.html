I'm more interested in the girl inside of it, but the skirt is nice too, I guess.

Watching all the cliffhangers happen and then going apeshit over them in the livethreads and suffering during the wait for the next episode is what makes Symphogear so fun.</br>  Why are there no good Symphogear wallpapers?  <br> 4 times  <br>Like that's a lot of times. I've seen it at least 2-3 times a day, besides the times I just leave it playing while doing other things.</br></br>  <br>Anon, you clearly don't praise the Nana.<br>Seven is the minimum you should have watched it by now.</br></br>  <br>bikis bikis have too much phonic gain in this</br>    <br>The episode only a handful of times.<br><br>The shuttle landing sequence? At least several times every day since it aired.</br></br></br>  Still no preview pics.  Anyone know where I could find a webm or mp4 of G's Genjuro training montage, the Rocky inspired one?<br><br>It seems that clip finally got pulled from youtube.</br></br>  <br>Is this the new subs where?</br>  Doujins of Hibiki going berserk and raping Miku when?  <br>Nah, she's just a tamed dog before Miku.</br>  <br>A cute Maria is fine indeed.</br>  <br>Never, enjoy your doujins of Hibiki going berserk and raping Chris instead</br>  <br>Doujins of Hibiki going berserk and Miku raping her when?</br>  <br>More likely would be Miku in yandere mode raping Hibiki.</br>  <br> SENKOU </br>    Is it better to be a Hibiki, be a hero and have a Miku, or to be a Miku, be a housewife and have a Hibiki?    <br>Exactly. That and her song from season 2.</br>  <br>Hibiki treats Miku pretty poorly<br>I'd be better to be Hibiki, be awesome and have a forgiving waifu to fall back on</br></br>  <br>Being a housewife sounds like a pretty sweet deal, all things considered.  Being able to ravage Hibiki on a nightly basis is what seals the deal, though. </br>  <br>Being Miku would be really stressful, but I'd also feel really bad taking advantage of her the way Hibiki does.</br>  <br>That still gets to me.<br><br>It's not a suplex, it's a back body drop.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Hibiki after she has a long, painful fight with Noise.</br></br>  <br> tfw Hibiki comes home, still in her skintight Symphogear suit, sweating from her fight against Noise, adrenaline still pumping in her veins, and roughly takes you for a fuck against the wall </br>  Would you rather be a Miku ravaging Hibiki, a Tsubasa ravaging Maria, or a Fine ravaging Chris?  <br> Fine ravaging Chris <br>Obviously.</br></br>  <br>Shirabe getting ravaged by Kirika.</br>  <br> Chris  ravaging  Miku </br>  <br>I want to get ravaged by Tsubasa</br>  <br> Chris ravaging anything </br>    <br>Chris can be pretty dom at times, she's just outclassed by alphalords like Tsubasa-senpai</br>  <br>I don't want to die</br>  <br> dat pic <br>Scary as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Just watched it for the first time and I'm still trying to take it all in. It was goddamn glorious.</br>  <br>Mind blowing.<br>She's greater live than studio recorded.<br>She gives interesting MC too.</br></br></br>  <br> senpai will never ravage your ass <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I like watching the audience go fucking nuts in her concerts</br>  <br>Yeah, Nanafags are interesting individuals despite how ugly they can look.<br>Nana said when she gave a MC in her overseas concert she said her fans were translating things for the others that can't ching chong nipnong which was nice and Nana was moved for their passion to learn.</br></br>  How to be as cool as senpai?  <br>All the food she eats has to go SOMEWHERE right?</br>  <br>You need to be voiced by Nana Mizuki.</br>  <br>That isn't fair</br>  <br>So is life.</br>  <br><br>I hadn't noticed, nearly spilled my liquor. God damn it. Remins me how they told Miyuki Sawashiro to ham it up in season 1.</br></br>  <br>I hope Carol ends this unfair world</br>  <br>Still waiting for a Bikki/Chris eating scene.</br>  <br>Someone that cute can't have bad intentions.</br>  <br>Why not Kirika dess</br>  <br>Why does Chris have such poor table manners?</br>  <br>She can be there too.</br>  <br>She was never taught to wipe her face  I'm sorry </br>  <br>Now that I think about it, those two look like they could get along really well.</br>  <br>Because we love to see her have mushrooms stuck to her cheek, her mouth smeared with sauce and somehow manage to put noodle under her mug.  That sounds so lewd </br>  <br>She is a lewd girl</br>  <br>Better learn to handle me well  my dear senior </br>  <br>I don't think they bother teaching proper dining etiquette to child prostitutes.<br><br>I bet she knows proper sex etiquette though.</br></br></br>  <br>Chris is pure</br>  <br>They've had almost no interactions with one another. It's like each's inherent bakaness naturally repels the other.</br>  <br>Hibiki is just as bad.</br>  <br><br><br>No bully.</br></br></br>   no show has ever made you hype for the OP <br>How did they do it? It's such a great series but the thing I'm anticipating the most is the opening</br>  <br>Tablemanners anon here.<br>I really love her for that and her angry outbursts. Nothing can beat a skilled girl.</br></br>  <br>RIP Flowers.</br>  I want Hibiki to beat me to death  <br>It probably does in terms of writing, Two genki bakas together can break the flow of a scene.<br><br> It's for this sort of silly shit we have the OVA's though. </br></br></br>  <br>Embarrassed Chris is the cutest</br>  <br> prostitutes <br>Prostitutes get paid. Chris was just a sex toy.</br></br>  What exactly is happening here  <br>Why do we call them child prostitutes. Children aren't allowed to work so they can't be prostitutes. Chris was a (sex) slave, first to random strangers and then to Finé.</br>  This was from last thread, but the reason Chris looked taller in S1 is that everyone remembers her height wrong: the Nehushtan armor has enormous platform shoes.  <br>Chris gear has them too. The cuts just rarely ever showed them stand close to each other.</br>  <br>Poor Chris. Hibiki's fist must have amazing therapeutic properties.</br>  <br>She didn't get paid but I'm sure her captors did,  and paid handsomely if they had any mind for business .</br>  <br>A child can still take money in exchange for sex even if the law won't allow it. I imagine it's much more common for her to be explored by a pimp though and it's the pimp who would get the money. It's arguable whether you should call the child a prostitute in the latter case, but it's usually what people mean when they say child prostitution.</br>  <br>Miku asserting her dominance<br><br>Making girls choke with your fingers is pretty common in bdsm stuff</br></br></br>  Threadly reminder that DESS is best<br><br>All other Geahs  are also great in their own ways and I love them all. </br></br>  <br>Aoi should wear Nehushtan.</br>  <br>DESS doesn't even have a personality beyond being screaming DESS like a chuuni</br>  <br>Akatsuki DESS</br>  <br>One of the few scenes in S1 where they actually stand besides each other on even ground.<br>Chris gear has always had enorm platform shoes and she still only looks barely taller with them on in comparison to Hibiki. Chris is supposed to be smaller but in S1 there wasn't any real detail or consistency in terms if height, she only looks like the smallest starting with G where we see our Gears really work and fight together besides each other.</br></br>  Guys, which symphogay should get the Dansleif relic?<br> &gt;implying it won't be miku again </br>  <br>Hibiki already has practice</br>  <br>Hibiki is the only option.</br>  <br> Eating another Gungnir <br>I wish she would just fuse with it already.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki seems like the obvious answer.  I really hope it'll be Miku again, though. </br>  <br><br>that's the funniest moment this season.</br></br>  <br>What does Dansleif even do?</br>  <br>Maria. So she can be useful again.</br>  <br>It's really, really good at killing things.<br>  for now I have drawn Dáinsleif, which the dwarves made, and which must cause a man's death every time it is bared, nor ever fails in its stroke; moreover, the wound heals not if one be scratched with it.' </br></br>  "How to stop war?" - By Yukine Chris  <br>Yeah, that's the point where you realise the writers know that 'full retard' works for symphogear.<br>It goes from stupid awesome to hilariously absurdly awesome.</br></br>  <br>In the myths, whenever the wielder draws the sword with the intention to kill someone, that poor bastard will die without fail. Its practically a one-handed Gae Bolg.</br>  <br>Pretty standard cursed weapon stuff. Required to kill every time it's drawn, makes wounds that don't heal. Probably nothing to worry about.</br>  <br>I've seen this picture too many times now, I'm not sure if DESS is supposed to wear glasses or not.</br>  <br>I want Miku to get it so she can clash swords with Hibiki again.</br>  <br>DMJii Clark Kent'ed it up for half an episode, remember? I think that was the only time she ever wore glasses.</br>  <br> Implying Maria isn't already useful by relieving Tsubasa's stress every night </br>  How much can Bikki deadlift? I mean she fucking tossed that space ship.  <br>Just watched S1 again, and I had forgotten all of the Kanade spooky voice moments. It's actually hard to imagine Tsubasa wanting to get involved with anyone else ever.</br>  <br>Maria is useful since her happy face makes me happy and her sad face makes me hard. A bit of everything.</br>  <br>Carol  And for her to never turn good. </br>  I hope everyone remembered to order the first cd when it came out.<br>Surely you want to support symphogear right?</br>  <br>Because you're not looking hard enough</br>  <br><br> implying Maria won't die this season for more Tsubasa drama. </br></br>  <br>A cute single mom</br>  <br> more Tsubasa drama <br>When will she get her break? Its like she's always to be the one that shoulders everyone's problems so everyone can jerk off to Bikki and the others without no problems.</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa screams a lot in ep 7 <br><br>Maria is still the last of the gears to have not sung her Zessho.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a responsible senpai's role.</br>  <br> That interview where Nana says she screamed a lot during ep 7 recording <br><br>Yes. This pleases my dick.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Implying Tsubasa cares for useless Maria <br>The one who'll die in ep 7 is  Chris </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>That reminds me of the manga for S1 when they were analyzing Hibiki<br><br> Her butt is her charm point <br><br>mikudatass.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I think FIRST LOVE SONG and Hajimari no Uta count as Zesshous.</br>  <br>It'll be Genjuro. It fits too well narratively for it not to be him.  If we're assuming someone has to die at all, I mean. </br>  <br>Would you be willing to share the first two?</br>  <br>A good method.</br>  <br> just hold my hand and we'll be fine <br><br>The subliminal message in that scene just isn't subliminal at all.</br></br></br>  <br>True, I just feel like they'll make Maria do one solo so that way they can record Hikasa singing the activation song, so then all the gears will have sung it at some point.</br>  <br>http://a.uguu.se/knuhrr.jpg<br>http://a.uguu.se/pujcop.png</br></br>  <br>I want her to somehow get a clock gear again. That shit was cool.<br><br>And part of the reason why I mained Wallachia in MB.</br></br></br>    <br>God's work, anon.</br>  <br> clock <br>cloak</br></br>  <br>bump  pls </br>  <br><br>Calling it now - Tsubasa dies to reunite with Kanade.<br> then revives later during the final episode </br></br></br>   Still no news about a Sugita or Sawasahiro cameo return. <br>Fuck this shit.</br>  <br> Will both of them revive? What if Kanade is the one who gets Dáinsleif? </br>  <br> cloak <br> cloaca </br></br>  <br>That would be a really bizarre regression of character development</br>  <br>There are so many things that i want to happen and many i dont yet want to see.<br>Overall u want miku geah</br></br>  <br>Why not? Maria got the same treatment and even got her own relic for it.</br>   Episode 10, season 1 <br> All this time I wondered why I didn't have an armed gear and how it sucked to be a incomplete fighter. But now I know why, it was so I could hold your hands and become close to you both! <br><br>Rewatching S1 after those years is wonderful, episode 10 was beautiful.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she already tried it.</br>  It's amazing how a single talented voice can make a mediocre funshit series into an AWESOME one.  how do you explain to people why you like symphogear when they say they do not like it because it seems like a crappy B-rated sci-fi movie  <br>It took two women, a "friend" and a kouhai, to get the sand out of Tsubasa's ass. TWO.</br>  <br>Assuming they've actually watched it and given it a chance, then you don't. Some people just don't like great things. Their loss.</br>  <br> A single talented voice <br>Blatant shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Not gonna lie. I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone because even I enjoy it just for the VAs and the music.</br>  <br> TsuNasa <br>kek. Gimme a minute, I have the proper one around here somewhere...</br></br>  <br>It's an educated opinion, you sperg.</br>  <br>You're absolutely not educated in the least if you think Nana is the only "talented" voice in this amazing cast.</br>  <br> single talented voice <br>I can't argue with that because Nana is really great, but telling that Ayahi Takagaki and Aoi Yuuki isn't something amazing too is wrong.<br>Don't be blinded by Nana`s light. Nana reminds us not to be blinded by one thing or person, you should always consider that there are other people that are talented too. <br>Get your shit right, or else you're a shame to us, please don't call yourself a Nana fan.</br></br></br></br>  HAHA SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  <br>Your opinion is shit<br> that pic <br>At least fix your levels</br></br></br>  <br> Nana reminds us not to be blinded by one thing or person, you should always consider that there are other people that are talented too. <br><br>Don't believe the idolspeak. She only says that because she knows she's superior.</br></br></br>  <br>ITSU SHOOWWWTAIMMU</br>  <br><br>Aside from Kirika's seiyuu being a talented newbie we also had Yui Horie, the amazing Yoshino Nanjo and Yoko Hikasa. Yoko may not have been around that much lately but what she did in K-On!'s music was magical.<br>Heck, Ayahi graduated as the top of her grade majoring in Opera from a Tokyo music college, she alone could take on Nana, same thing with Nanjo's amazing range and character voices.<br><br>Geah basically has the best singing seiyuu cast ever seen and it even brings those singers to their limits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How can you make sure? You can't even read her mind.<br>Please stop saying things that can ruin Nana`s image, she isn't even doing anything wrong here, its only just the ignorant fucks like   that does anything wrong.</br></br>  <br>It's shit posting anon. Just ignore it and they'll go away.<br>I highly doubt anyone thinks the other singers aren't very talented as well.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>If you think only Nana is the good one hear you should reflect on your life because you're only one step away from being a obnoxious idolfucker, which are the rotten tomatoes and the shame of Nana`s fanbase. <br>Praising Nana is not that bad but we should always be reminded that Nana respects everyone she meets and we should fucking do so too.</br></br></br>  Many people may not know this but some time ago Aoi Yuuki collaborated with a very famous Vocaloid producer<br>Here's the result.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1oq<wbr>t48sC_4o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I always loved that song ever since I heard it.<br>I love Deco*27, I really hope Nana and the others collabs with Deco too.</br></br>  <br>Damn. Deco and aoi? It's like heaven.<br><br>Personally aoi is my favorite in symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br>I just love Aoi.<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/wscjceeqqv.mp3<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>kz collaborated with Suzuko Mimori and Riho Iiida with SunaP. I don't want to go off topic too much with seiyuu/singers foreign to Geah though.<br>The songs are called High and Loud and Text&gt;Over, I highly recommend checking them out if you haven't.<br><br> Damn. Deco and aoi? It's like heaven. <br>You bet it is, Aoi fits Deco's soft electronica songs in an amazing way I can't describe.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ayahi Takagaki sings my favourite SymphoSongs. Memory gets me every time, and the EDs are amazing. Chris deserves all the love she gets, she's the best.  <br>Personally Aoi is my favorite in anything she ever touches.</br>  <br>Check out Ayahi's versions of Amazing Grace, Defying Gravity and All I want for Christmas is you.<br>She has cover albums of western songs called melodia and melodia2 which are amazing.<br>You could also download her live "Relation of Colours" - The first part is opera style ballads and the second goes full rock.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been iffy on some of her roles. But the way she voices hibiki and even integrates it into the songs is just absolute perfection.</br>  <br>thank you</br>  <br>What song is this?</br>  Speaking of Nana.<br/>  What about Aoi x bermei ?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FGG<wbr>6PVhUhB8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Angelique Sky, from イシュメル</br></br></br>  <br>only if you have   Determination  </br>  <br> commies lyrics  <br> even close to correct  <br><br>Anon do you even remember any of the other seasons.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget her 00 character songs by KOKIA, fucking amazing.</br>  <br> I Love You </br>   Genjuro is going to die in episode 7 , there will be a lot of screaming.  <br>I didn't forget it, I just don't remember it as being amazing.</br>  <br>Stoooop</br>  <br>Well part of it is KOKIA writing outstanding music as always, but they do showcase her vocal talents well with both a rock style song and a very classical ballad. I'm especially a fan of her classical singing, I find it amazing she can sing like that considering her usual singing voice.</br>  <br>Justice is a lot better than I remembered it to be. Then again, there probably isn't an Ayahi song I don't like. You can really hear the KOKIA influence.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she actually sang backup vocals on both those songs too to even further drive the point home.</br>  <br>Ninja will succeed him, I am assured.<br>I don't remember if he got a song yet or not, but that would be the perfect time to give him one for the manly death.</br></br>  <br>Genjuro got a song in one of the best scenes of season 2.<br><br>Too bad that scene got pulled from youtube. Would love to be able to have a handy link to it always available.</br></br></br>  <br>Defying Gravity is probably still my favourite song, her english is so cute it's unreal. Yume no Tonari's progression is amazing as well.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gmy<wbr>oRq-lYps</wbr>  [ ] Forgot my link.</br></br>  <br>You can always link to the original.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/E0HDavmtK3Y  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I meant having the scene on hand for the frequent times, in forums, when people have never heard of Symphogear.</br>  <br>Did you miss Chris shoving her muff into Hibi's face before shooting off enough missles to level K2<br>I didn't.<br>Flamenco life sucking robot kissed a boy though.

Once that line is crossed, all bets are off.</br></br>  <br>So that's how Bikkie goes berzikkie this time. Stealing Miku's lips was a really bad idea.</br>  <br>Tried using the website "streamable.com" (because forums tend to only allow embedding videos from certain sites) on a video of the entire episode, but that site only allows clips of up to 1 minute, and the scene is about 90 seconds long.</br>  <br> Flamenco doll meets Ogawa <br>   Can dolls feel love? </br></br>  <br>Get puu.sh and upload it there.</br>  <br> Implying Miku won't force herself on Bikkie out of desperation once she realises Phara might steal Bikkie's first kiss </br>  <br> in forums </br>  <br> Eh? Nandatte? Was there some rice on my lips? Thanks, Miku! </br>  <br>Her singing on Defying Gravity was excellent, but that arrangement was unfortunately terrible.</br>  <br>I liked it, it was refreshing.</br>  <br>I can make a sound webm of that scene in like 10 seconds</br>  <br> 10 seconds <br>What the fuck are you using if the conversion only takes that much time?</br></br>  <br> you will never hear that song again <br>why live?</br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha</br>  <br> I need Berzikkie and Yandemiku trying to rape each other in my live. While singing their incredible gay songs declaring their love for each other in breathy voices. While rolling around on the floor. Sweating. </br>  <br>Phonic gain</br>  New 3 way when  <br>Never.  It'll be at least a 6-way. </br>  <br><br>What if, now stay with me here, what if, when multiple gears transform at once, it's all in one bubble, instead of just splitscreen?</br></br>  Alright, let's do this.  <br> Dr. Ver </br>  <br>that would be pure cause with them rubbing up agents each other <br> I cant wait </br></br>  <br>*chaos</br>  God damn I just was some fucking preview pictures holy shit.  <br> NEW is gone from products <br>At least they're updating fairly regularly</br></br>  <br>I tried really hard to time it and get Bikki, I'm ok with a last action hero though.</br>  <br><br> I forgot how to stop these, someone help </br></br>  <br> Genjuuro </br>  <br>I remember G's previews would show up around 4 or 5 AM when I was still asleep, so I'm going to guess we'll get them sometime within the next 6 hours hopefully.</br>  <br>Sorry you don't get to befriend any of the symphos.</br>  <br>Just click and drag, or take a screenshot.<br> Baka. </br></br>  <br><br> Tight <br><br>That ass is fat, which is not a bad thing. But it doesn't look like the toned butt she had before.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kirika <br>Yes. I am baka.  T-Thanks </br></br>  <br> Genjuro <br>I'll take it.</br></br>  <br><br>You could try the Google Translate app, take a picture of the text and it translates it...decently. It won't always translate the entire sentence together but it should give you enough to work with.</br></br>  <br> Chris </br>  <br> Animejanai <br>At least we can talk about our favorite series, plus, she is cute.</br></br>  <br><br>For some reason I still expect Chris to wipe her mouth with her hair, then get really embarrassed when she realizes what she just did.</br></br>  <br> filename </br>  <br>As long as you mean the upper mouth.</br>  <br>We're talking Nanoha-style befriending here, right?</br>  <br>Getting hit with a girls big pink thing as hard as she can, yes.</br>  <br>Of course!</br>  <br><br>She's good, definitely not the best though.</br></br>  <br>That outfit was already slutty before the edit.</br>  <br><br> tfw getting befriended by Chris <br>The best death a man could wish for.</br></br></br>  <br>If you are talking about being beated down until you pass out and becoming good friends in the process, then yes.</br>  <br><br>Don't sexualise the Dess!!</br></br>  <br>I can't get over their open gayness/partner look. HibiMiku+Chris as the pet might as well be canon.</br>  <br> implying Chris would even realize that was bad manners. </br>  <br>I can sexualize Kiri-chan all I want.</br>  <br>A fight breaks out between Hibiki and Vita, what happens?</br>  <br> Last thing the Flamenco bitch hears is a high pitched screech </br>  <br>In almost any other series, she would be best girl. It's a shame for her that she is stuck in a series with goddesses.</br>  <br>Kirika and Shirabe are so much cuter this season. I like them a lot more than I thought I would.</br>  <br>Fix your shit, Moot.</br>  <br>Hibiki beats the shit out of her, then proceed to fight Nanoha in a battle in which they destroy cities while befriending each other.</br>  <br>That makes no sense.<br><br>On the left, the black scrunchie is going in between Shirabe's arm and Kirika's arm, but on the right it appears out from behind Kirika's arm.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the tragic fate of girls in the same show as Bikki.</br>  <br>What if she has shit taste?</br>  <br>We have failed.</br>  <br>It's one bi-colored scruchy, anon. Look again.</br>  <br>Physics is no match for adorable lesbians.</br>  <br>Do you have this pictures with either a lot more of a lot less pixels?</br>  <br>Maybe<br>Maybe this is the reason for that warped berserk form because while Durandal doesn't really have much of a legend surrounding it Dainleif is one of the two swords that is needing to kill whenever it goes out</br></br>  <br>For what purpose would such a large multicolored scrunchie exist?</br>  <br> conveniently hiding the matching hearts on their shorts <br>I see that they're trying to act reversed this time.</br></br>  <br>In a serious fight, Vita's ability to fly is too big of an advantage against an opponent with no ranged attacks.<br><br>I was thinking something more akin to a bar fight.<br><br>Although Hibiki vs Subaru would also be interesting to see................or a battle of who is more gay between Miku and Subaru...........</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As long as Hibiki stayed aggressive with thrusters/rocket punch, she could keep up with a flying opponent.</br>  <br>I want to kiss that chick on Biki's top, right on the beak.</br>  <br>I don't like it, but I'm saving it. Thanks anon.</br>  <br>This just proves that she is great material.<br>She is just a bit overshadowed.<br><br><br>She still has a likeable personality and a cute body, that's enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For DMJii, of course. It's cute shit for girls so it exists. Could also be a selfmade wrist band.</br>  <br> ................ <br> ........... <br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>They have matching hearts on their shirts as well.</br>    <br> ................ </br>  <br>"no"</br>  <br>This reminds me P4's "Game" level.</br>  Why Ao-chan so emotional during the 2013 live? Is that her first llive concert? <br>Men, I live Ao-chan so much, her Rainbow Flower performed bring me to tear ;_; I love Nana-chan too, she so lovable, even though she very famouse but she so friendly and charismatic ;_;</br>  <br>I LIKE IT!<br>I don't know what I'd do without you anon.</br></br>  <br>I want to be paired with the 2hu girl.</br>  <br>LON <br>DON</br></br>  <br>Because it triggers your autism.</br>  <br>Will we ever see another bed scene again?</br>  Wait, who is this referring to? Chris?  <br> ebin trelelel <br>Go back to /v/.</br></br>  <br>Considering who's in charge of the script we might get another SoL episode/bed scene</br>  <br>No, it's referring to Anime-chan.</br>  <br>Believe</br>  Can Receptor Children be gay? Would Fine approve?  <br>Probably. The fact that they crammed subtext into the very first episode of the season sets a pretty good precedent, at least.  I kinda wish they'd move beyond subtext, but that's much more of a long shot. </br>  <br>Considering what Fine did at the end of season 2, yes and yes.</br>  <br>Considering her demeanor in G, she'd be cheering them on.</br>  <br> "You thought your first kiss would be with Hibiki, but it was with I, Phara!" </br>  I want a spinoff SOL with my geahs doing non-geah things.  <br>Are you Anime-chan?</br>  <br><br>You seem to forget Finé tying Chris to a cross torturing her while they were both naked in S1<br><br><br> Cooking with Geahs <br>It would be glorious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kanade <br><br>I win</br></br></br>  <br>Here's your price.</br>  <br>S1 Finé != S2 Finé. She genuinely listened to Hibiki's words at the end of S1 and never wanted to take control of anyone in S2.<br><br>And that's even even without taking into account the healing effects of the torture with regards to Nehushtan.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Carol kidnaps Anime-chan and spends the next few episodes learning about anime</br>  <br>She was utter shit last live so she is happy that she can catch up to Nana and Ayahi now.<br>Nana being kind and friendly is one of the reasons why many people like her.</br></br>  <br>You don't seem to understand what I'm getting at. Finé was always gay, before and after.</br>  <br>Fine said she wanted to proclaim her love for God, not a goddess.<br><br>Hence, Fine is straight.</br></br></br>  I'm expecting the parent-teacher conference to be the SoL episode of the season.<br> Only to be crushed and ruined to pieces by the 2hus and the dolls </br>  <br>Oh, you were talking about Carol. I thought were talking about that other blond with the silly hat. My mistake.</br>  <br>Wasn't Fine in love with God? What do you think the implications of that are?</br>  <br>The commander is going to stand in for chris' parents, right?<br><br>Please tell me he will.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't utter shit, she was just nervous because she somewhat inexperience compared to everyone else.<br>And people have take a liking on her because she gives her all to catch up with Nana and Ayahi.<br>Besides she potraits Hibiki character perfectly even in the Lives, which it isn't anything easy to do.</br></br></br>  <br>Basically guaranteed</br>  Anyone have an image of that "beat the shit and make up" speech that Chris says to Miku?  <br>He will.  And then he'll be killed not long afterwards. </br>  <br>That she's in love with something genderless on a higher plane. Someone who's centuries old like her wouldn't even care about genders.</br>  <br> what is bisexuality <br><br><br>They better not fucking dare<br><br><br>funny_and_original.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm finally watching s1 since I had it on my backlog forever and this season mostly sucks.<br><br>It's pretty fun and I think of Basara anytime I hear the op</br></br>  <br>Genjuro will not die, if anything he will have a fake death only to later save the day.</br>  <br>Poor Tsubasa will fucking go batshit insane again.</br>  Inbefore Genjuuro already gets heavily wounded/dies blocking the hit Hibiki was about to take at the end of the first episode.  <br>Isn't Symphogear God just a custodian?  What if God turns out to be an alien loli? </br>    <br>Instead of DMJii I wanted a good Nanjo character and a loli Yukari Tamura villain this season.</br>  Now every single Genjuro appearance this season is going to feel like a death flag  <br>Is he even anywhere REMOTELY close by?</br>  <br> I'm expecting the parent-teacher conference to be the SoL episode of the season. <br>And then turns into a family drama when Hibiki's dad shows up.</br></br>  <br> He gets a heavy wound and can't fight for the entire season <br> he won't be around in episode 7, so he'll avoid death <br>Even if it means that we'd lose a training montage, I'd be ok with that.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course he is. Remember that Maria and Tsubasa are in london while the rest are watching from japan where he is. Remember how he punched the snapping Tsubasa back into her place when she attacked Hibiki in season 1?</br>  <br> family drama <br>Will we ever see Tsubasa`s parents or she's adopted?</br></br>  <br>Tsubasas come from eggs.</br>  <br> Yukari Tamura loli  <br>I wish.<br>I hope Tsubasa gets a cute Yukarin loli imouto that will heal her heart after she goes berserker in Episode 7..</br></br></br>  <br> 77 <br>But Swords don't come from eggs.</br></br>  <br>I get that having them have different fighting styles is kind of their thing, but seeing Tsubasa or Chris break and go berserk and start fighting like Zerbikki would be terrifying</br>  <br> no Rio </br>  <br> all 3 girls go zerker on eachother in episode 7 <br> Tsubasa is the only one who lives </br></br>  <br> not level 77 <br>Also does this mean Tsubasa will go full Genjuro fighting without gear in the future?</br></br>  <br>Considering Tsubasa has lots of battle experience, I'm sure all hell will break loose once Tsubasa goes apeshit and goes berserker.</br>  <br> Tsubasa goes full Genjuuro <br>YES<br>E<br>S</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If we give her a Tsubanit/Medakanit, maybe she'll start punching enemies with her left while cutting them with the sword in her right. You have to combine her being a SWORD with Genjuuro.</br></br>  <br>She'll cut people using her bare hand as a blade.</br>  <br>Isn't it stated that she's from a honorable family who used to be samurai?<br><br>You can't drill her kind of mindset into filthy plebs, after all.</br></br></br>  <br>So you're telling me she herself will become  an edgelord? </br>  <br> "I am a sword. I sing only to fight" <br>She's always been an edgelord.</br></br>  <br>For some reason I imagine her running around Bleach now and it's hilarious.</br>  I kinda miss timid Tsubasa who always hid behind Kanade.  <br>She was really cute. That night really broke her, eh?</br>  <br>I think that night broke Kanade a bit more.</br>  <br>We could get an early training montage if this season's enemies are going to be so strong.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Both were broken that night, but Tsubasa screamed a lot more.</br></br>  Shirabe? More like ShiraBest.  <br>SENPAI</br>  This season we will finally get doujins, right? I want some fluffy Kiri-chan x Shirabe.  <br>I'm honestly surprised how little fanart and doujins and all that stuff this series has. You'd think that the yuri alone would be enough to get it a ton.</br>  <br> lolicon bait <br> best anything </br></br>   tfw still waiting for preview <br>There's gotta be more to life than refreshing a website.</br>  I just want some more ninja Ogawa or Genjuro punching stuff.  <br>デース</br>  <br>TBH, I'd totally watch a Genjuro focused spinoff.</br>   Only 1.5 days until EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAATE   <br>Are you determined to exterminate Noise by fisting them?</br>  <br>The Noise is gone anon.<br> grape-kun ;_; </br></br>  <br>That picture makes me hear his voice in my head.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NWf<wbr>VbI6Xui4</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> it has loli Tsubasa with Ogawa and Genjuuro adventures <br>FUND IT</br></br>  <br>That could also mean actual screentime for Kanade.</br>  <br> KANADE WON'T GET SCREEN TIME GET OVER IT </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127813519 <br>And I don't give two shits about you, kill yourself.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127813519 <br> lol <br> ..............  <br>Where the fuck do you people come from</br></br></br>  <br> Genjuro <br>I'm somehow okay with this</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127813519 <br>Are you 12?</br>  <br>Flying opponents probably aren't a problem for Hibiki at this point</br>  <br>Almost double that.<br><br>Flying opponents that can break the sound barrier, fire projectile attacks, and match her physical strength?</br></br></br>  <br> Almost double that. <br>Physically sure.

ONE MORE EPISODE</br>  Who let the underage brigade in?  Preview in 5 minutes, guys.  <br><br> Maria </br></br>  When's hibiki's song getting released?  <br>If only there was a Symphogear website with such information.</br>   <br>Huh, for a Japanese site it's actually pretty easy to navigate</br>  <br><br><br>Not him, but you would have never been upset if he just used one of those number generators or gave it a silly name.<br><br>Think about that for a little bit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry your pretty little head, the thread will lose it's shit when the torrents go up.</br>  <br> thinking they will spoil the surprise visit to ver while hes upside down in a padded room just shaking and making silly faces since his mind was so broken to ask about what the fuck Carol is </br>  <br>Fuck off.<br> all images and resulting discussion must pertain to anime or manga <br><br><br><br>The wait for some of them is going to be ridiculous.

Luckily they're first after the duet.<br>I may or may not be excited for the release of Chris' song.</br></br>   less than 36 hours <br>Still no preview pics.</br>  <br>I really hope someone picks some up from C88 to scan.<br> I'm this close to paying people to do just that </br></br>  It was the hypest fucking episode this season for me and I hope it keeps on going. I love how it's pretty much everything you can expect of Symphogear in one episode - cute girls singing during over the top action scenes.<br>It's still dumb but at people who are making it seem to know it.</br>  <br>Blame BS11 station.<br>Why they air GX 1 week later than other TV station?</br></br>  <br><br>Preview pics in 5 minutes, dude.</br></br>  <br>someone said 5 minutes more than half an hour ago.<br> Just wait </br></br>  The music in S1 when the tower goes above ground is almost just like the music from wild arms.  <br><br>Exterminate : July 22nd<br>Rebirth-day : July 29th<br><br>Charasong 1 (Seiten Galaxy Cross): July 7th<br>Charasong 2 (Hibiki): July 15th<br>Charasong 3 (Tsubasa): August 12th<br>Charasong 4 (Chris): August 19th<br>Charasong 5 (DESS): August 26th<br>Charasong 6 (Shirabe): September 2nd<br>Charasong 7 (Maria): September 9th<br>Charasong 8 (???): September 30th<br><br>BD1/Radiant Force: September 30th<br>BD2/???: October 28th<br>BD3/???: November 25th<br>BD4/???: December 23rd<br>BD5/???: January 27th<br>BD6/???: February 24th</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> need to wait until August for Tsubasa`s CD <br>kill me</br></br>  <br>Do you watch Dragonball, Sailor Moon or Precure for plot?</br>  <br> Maria behind DMJii </br>  <br> Maria second to the last <br>So fucking useless.</br></br>  <br><br>It's because they don't want to ruin the fact she dies.

Thanks, dudes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And we used to call Shirabe Buzzkill too.</br>  <br> Why did we call them this again? <br> We <br> Because some people like cringy things. </br></br></br>  <br>Because Shirabe is so fucking edgy back then.<br>Man, looking back at our past shit really brings up memories.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it was DMG and Buzzkill, before the combined name took on.<br>Shirabe turned out to not be a buzzkill, so it was just as well.<br><br>If I recall, I think Edjii was used for a very short while.</br></br></br></br>   Thinking either of these girls were edgy <br>Seriously? A little darkness and everyone cries edge now a days.</br>  <br>Wrong show.</br>  <br> Hibiki  <br> FUCK YES </br></br>  I want a cute Senpai-Kouhai scene.  <br> symphogear 1379443499452.jpg <br>Wouldn't it be easier to use folders?<br><br><br>Every Chris scene is cute though, so that's kind of redundant.</br></br></br></br></br>  Rewatching some episodes.

Bad enough so no one will dare to touch the franchise forever?  <br>From what I saw a week or two ago in the BD/DVD sales thread, it didn't do very well at all.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>860 copies on average if my sources are correct.</br>  <br>At least it's not on Aku no Hana level of bad.</br>  <br>When are we going to get the full version of this?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5UK<wbr>fMF9vYjI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>That should also be on BD6, I think.</br>  <br>Fuck, all the seiyuu were so good.<br><br> Alicia Florence </br></br></br>  <br>They are.<br>http://www.someanithing.com/series-<wbr>data-quick-view</wbr></br></br>  Cock is best girl  <br>Well it apparently isn't there.</br>  <br>That's not tiger.</br>  Holy shit, where are the Eto-bros?

There's just something about her.</br>  <br>Cats only have sex in one position though<br> Doggy-style </br></br>  <br>Dogs don't bite the female's back tho.</br>  <br>Oh man that image is adorable.</br>  <br>Only a few.

I'm merely supporting what you said, asshat.</br></br>  <br>Not to mention that these four beauties have quite a lot of subtext. I want the Nozomi and Kumiko pool scene where Nozomi talks about Mizore.</br>  <br> And I was specifically talking about the here and now. You said that here on /a/ yurifags outnumber anti yurifags. <br>Oh, I get it now. There's a bit of a misunderstanding. Allow me to elaborate on my stance.<br><br>On this board, /a/, in general, there are a lot more yuri fans than there are anti-yuri haters.<br>Which is why when the show was airing, and when a lot of people believed in a chance for a yuri end, yuri fans were the majority in these threads.<br>When the show ended and the yuri side "lost", large majority of them packed up and left these threads. So they're no longer the majority in these threads.<br>But they didn't leave this board, they're still on this site. They didn't collectively commit suicide. They're still on /a/, just not in these threads.<br><br> because everyone knew the first season wouldn't end conclusively <br>This is blatantly not true.<br>After episode 8 aired, a lot of people believed anime is going completely anime original.<br>Which is why when episode 10 aired, a lot of people were mad over getting baited.<br>Then when the episode 11 aired, a lot of people once again believed there's still a chance for an anime original yuri end due to the anime original scene there. People were constantly talking about how the last episode will end with Reina realizing she loves Kumiko instead of Taki-Sensei.

But please enlighten me.</br></br>      <br>Eh, it's not that popular compared to other shows. But I think it's been pretty enjoyable for a Yugioh series.<br><br>The difference about ship teasing with Yugioh is that it rotates out its cast and MC every few years, so there's slightly more chance of it paying off.</br></br></br>  <br>She does as she pleases, do not take advantage of her naivety. <br><br>Yugioh has always been popular barring Zexal I.</br></br></br>  <br>You should watch Arc-V it's fun!</br>  <br>damn that cute trap....why does  s he have to be too cute.</br>  <br>helprincess is really great and you best not be talking shit about raingoat</br>  <br>They are surprisingly decent shounen which aren't popular enough with normies for /a/nons to get uptight about.</br>  <br>Selena is the one trying to take advantage of the emotionally broken Shun.</br>  <br>Because It's not a typical shounen like all other instances of YGO. It's some kind of hybrid Shounen-Shoujo that isn't afraid to delve into darker themes like wars of aggression - although it unfolds things gradually enough to evoke actual suspense and mystery - and not only is the main heroine basically co-protagonist with the MC, but they depend on each other and the MC is a guy with detailed psychological issues instead of a random middle-schooler or a stoic duel god. On top of all that, it tickles my desire to autistically analyze card games, the music is awesome, and I can't think of any significant characters I dislike. It's a masterpiece.</br>  <br>philosophers stone searches any fusion card so long as there's a winged kuriboh in the yard</br>  <br>I'm not entirely sure myself. I've been following the franchise since 2007 and it never got so much attention on /a/. 5Ds and Zexal would get occasional threads but they wouldn't last very long without a small number of anons bumping the threads with fanart.<br><br>What's weird to me is that Arc-V gained acceptance almost immediately. People weren't really that hyped for it before it came out, and I thought Arc-V's starting episodes were pretty weak.</br></br></br>  There are people in this thread<br><br>RIGHT NOW<br><br>That think Serena isn't still working with Academia.</br></br></br></br>  Where is Joey? Tristan?  <br>Do not lie bird boy.</br>  <br>Sora was totally Academia's fuckboy.</br>  <br>Simple answer the show is enjoyable enough for the anons to keep making up constant threads. <br><br>Also Xth for Where is Yuzu?<br><br>Really thankful for it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Back in 1998.</br>  <br>Ya talkin shit bout mai waifu m8?</br>  <br>Poor boy Shun can do nothing about it.</br>  <br>Okay, chumpfuck.<br>Kill yourself now and cease your suffering, your Arc-V-less, shitstain of an existance.<br>Or, embrace the Kamen Rider Gaim of the franchise, the pinnacle of card game anime, the Evangelion of children's card games. It goes by many epithets, but one can't simply speak of how much it has furthered its genre and pushed the level of metafuckery precedented in anime as a whole. One must experience Arc-V for theirself, before it is too late. Every fleeting second you would take while contemplating this choice on your ineptitude is a happening you will never live through, an announcement you will never appreciate the magnitude of and live the moment for, a contemporary masterpiece you will never proudly tell your grandchildren "I was there" to, just a spectre of your biggest error at this juncture in your life—"What could have been."<br><br>You have all the power, now choose wisely.<br><br>7 episode rule.<br>Episodes 19 and 20 are skippable.<br>Rest is smooth sailing.<br>Enjoy yourself, cunt.<br>Stolen from the MEGA anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will, duel me.</br>  <br> Ｉ’ｖｅ　ｎｅｖｅｒ　ｗａｔｃｈｅｄ　ａ　Ｙｕ－Ｇｉ－Ｏｈ！　ｓｅｒ<wbr>ｉｅｓ　ｂｅｆｏｒｅ　ｏｒ　ｅｖｅｒ　ｐｌａｙｅｄ　ｔｈｅ　ｇａｍｅ　<wbr>ｉｎ　ｍｙ　ｌｉｆｅ，　ｃａｎ　Ｉ　ｐｉｃｋ　ｔｈｉｓ　ｕｐ?</wbr></wbr> <br><br>Yes. Aside from missing a few references to all four previous series, not recognizing AU versions of two characters from a previous series and failing to understand headcanon theories of how the Yu-Gi-Oh! universe is modeled, you will not be lacking in anything vital to the understanding of the plot or general enjoyment of the show.<br>Arc-V also does a good job of teaching those new to the game the basic rules and all the various summoning methods; learn as you go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, my hands are kinda tied at the moment.</br>    <br>Reminder that right now Sora is being filled with injections that will forever stunt his growth. Not even the spirit of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh will allow him to get through puberty.</br>  <br> Ａｃｔｉｏｎ　Ｃａｒｄｓ　are　ｂs <br>There is much controversy and skepticism surrounding ‘Action Cards’ and their addition to the “Yu-Gi-Oh!” anime franchise. Most of this negativity however comes from the nostalgia shit-smeared vision of shitters, and their unwillingness to cope with change in the world. Like so many of their shallow ideas, this is, of course, bullshit. Action Cards are a wonderful addition to the anime, lightening the load on need for topdecking and situational-as-fuck cards, as well as enabling “Action Duels”, allowing for completely new levels of gameplay to take hold.<br>The term “topdecking” is one familiar to many Yu-Gi-Oh! followers. Not one that incites excitement, but rather feelings of indifference and helplessness more often than not—“shouganai”. The topdeck writing device has become old hat; predictable and a letdown. The previous four series have done it to death and Action Cards are like a breath of fresh air. Why let the duel be decided on a single topdeck, which everybody is cynical about, when you can have the characters actually run for their lives, perform acrobatics or initiate skilly monster-mounted manoeuvres to steal that lifeline which will let them last just one round longer, and hope for a comeback their next turn.<br>Action Cards (and Action Duels by extension) introduce an unprecedented level of surprise and thrill to the game. The dangers of 'Solid Vision with mass' make themselves known circa episode 3, where the main heroine and three children almost fall to their doom, all at the turn of a simple ‘Action Trap’, and from since then on, the threats have only scaled as with the stakes. These threats are ever-looming and ever-present throughout the duels as opposed to two mugs standing around looking like dickheads playing a children’s card game until one of them loses and gets put out of commission. Arc-V actually makes a spectacle of the game, a true sport.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sawatari's waifu is a midget raccoon.</br>  <br>You now notice Yuya's obscenely large ears.</br>  <br>I now request darwfag anon to draw yuuya dressed as link and Yuzu as Zelda for SCIENCE!</br>  shun is cute~ cute~!!!  <br>We know, Ruri.</br>  <br> Implying there are drawfags here <br>I haven't seen one in a while.</br></br>  The showcase duel is today, right?  <br>because they are scared because of anons asking them to draw their fetishes all the time so they hide.</br>  <br>The what?</br>  Sakuriboh<br>Dark Fiend / Effect<br>LV1 300/200<br>(1) If this card is Tributed: Draw 1 card.

I don't remember the name but that one had a different picture every time. In this case I'm assuming it's a slightly related old reference. Neat.</br>  <br>So are they just going to throw in minor characters that never appear again in the ED?</br>  <br><br><br>back to tumblr</br></br></br>  <br>Balance Doll</br>  <br>Nice meme</br>  <br>Lewd version</br>  11 minutes before subs   [HorribleSubs] Gintama - 279 [720p].mkv <br><br>It's out!</br></br>   Image dump begins                 <br>Pandemonium-san is my waifu.</br>  A cute    A cute     Gedomaru OST <br>Nice, it's been a while<br>I'm waiting for the episode where they'll get back the Stand arc ost</br></br>        <br>They used one of the songs from the stand arc in the reunion arc.</br>      <br>Is the quality good like last episode? Or is it QUALITY-infested again?</br>    And next week   never read into the manga this far <br> dat plot twist  <br>HYPE</br></br>    I laughed the most for the realistic close-up shot of sukonbu.  <br> the most fanservice Gintama has is of male characters. </br>  <br>There's fanservice of the female characters too though.</br>  <br>Is Gintoki the worst executioner of all time? One of the people he tried to execute even came back in the current manga arc.</br>  Now that I think about it, wasn't there a law against carrying swords in Gintama?  <br>For most people yes. But people affliated with the Bakufu or with a certain status (like the Yagyus) are permitted to keep their swords. Everybody else are screwed.</br>  <br>Of course government people would be allowed to. But the Reaper was walking casually around the town with a sword, without trying to hide it, even before the murders started. That should have made her stand out even more.</br>  <br>There are also supposed to be Amanto walking around everywhere. It's best not to pay too much attention to what's supposed to make sense in Gintama.</br>  <br>The arc where they make them all go back was too racist to print, so they skipped it.</br>  <br>back home*</br>  I need more Kondo butt  Sudoku    <br>Wow, that the fuck.</br>  Hopefully this arc will have a good ending unlike the others this season.  <br>It will.</br>  <br>Based Yabuki.</br>  <br>A lot of people walk around without the permission to carry swords. I'm not sure why, but I guess they only really care if you get caught using it by the police.</br>  Right now I'm starting the anime and plan on just reading the manga when I get to the last episode (so far) and then watching each episode. Is the anime pretty close to the manga?  <br>Latest chapter in the manga is 548, while the anime is jumping around animating the chapters from 400-500, shifting around the order of arcs.</br>  <br>Then so episode 1 is around chapters 400-500? Or do you mean that lately they're jumping around chapters?</br>  <br>With the newest season. Current season starts with episode 266, but is actually animating chapter 484, and then jumps around animating chapters in the early-mid 400s.</br>  Does anyone have the media player classic opening screen versions with Gintoki?  <br>So basically the best way would be to watch until the newest season, then start reading manga from there?</br>  <br>Or watch until you're caught up and then read from chapter 411, which is the earliest unanimated chapter.</br>  <br>Sounds good. My biggest concern is that I don't want to get confused with the plot or anything like that.</br>  Is that a new ost track at the end?<br><br>It's kind of great.</br></br>  <br>Lucky for you, most arcs and chapters self-contained stories, but there are serious arcs and chapters that do advance the plot and provide important backstories.</br>  <br>They played it during the episode too didn't they? It must be this arcs theme.</br>  <br>futa theme &gt; shinigami theme</br>   mfw i heard asaemon's voice   <br> seconding this</br>  <br>It starts at 21:02. I so want a full version.</br>          <br>Will she appear again? Too bad her episode is meh</br>  I know this line is sort of a meme, but Goku never actually said this right?  <br>It's probably because of all the times that Krillin has died in the series.</br>  <br>He said the line when he fought Nappa but instead of Krillin he said Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu</br>  When does Gintama become 16:9?<br>I'm on around episode 100.</br>  <br>I thought he said it to Frieza? My memory of Dragonball is pretty bad though</br>  <br>after 201 i think</br>  <br>Yeah, this</br>  <br>You should be all good if you are watching the newly-made BDs. We all watched it on an even lower res</br>  Asaemon a cute, A CUTE.  <br>gintama is super interesting</br>  <br>Marina Inoue is perfect for her.</br>    Jesus Christ pls tell me Asaemon will show up again. Only one episode and she's already best girl.  <br/>  <br>This is her arc, so you're gonna have plenty of Asaemon<br><br> Doujins of Asaemon never </br></br></br>  <br>Might as well start reading To love ru, just for the fanservice  and Momo </br>  <br>Wait, so there are arc that actually explain this ?<br>I thought the meme "katsura did his job" is a joke.</br></br>  <br>It's a joke</br>  <br>Gintama with this art style<br>Would it be better or not?</br></br>  This episode felt oddly cinematic.<br><br>Also, did the seppuku scene in the beginning remind anyone else a bit of the seppuku scene at the end of Hyouge Mono?</br></br>  <br>Don't know, but someday i want Hasemi Saki to draw a Gintama chapter and Gorilla one of To Love-ru</br>  <br>The only thing i can point of this episode being kinda odd are the dialogues, if you pay attention you can see that they have some pauses, like they were reading the script and then talk and so</br>  <br>they've been saving their budget lately, hopefully they'll improve the action scenes since this arcs big fight was pretty underwhelming in the manga</br>  <br>I didn't mean odd in a negatively, there was just a striking difference in the overall composition of the entire episode compared to a normal episode. It reminded me of that scene in the Four Devas are where Gin finds Otose bleeding and other similar "serious" moments.</br>  <br>Maybe they just wanted to emphasize the seriousness of this arc</br>  <br>I suppose so.</br>  <br>In between all of the cut-off nipple jokes, right?</br>  <br>I felt those were out of place as well</br>  <br>Gintama frequently has physical comedy jokes near the start of its serious arcs. See Tsukuyo's first appearance and all the kunai hitting Gintoki.</br>  <br>I remember that joke actually being funny though</br>  <br><br>Best ED</br></br>  How come this series manages to keep this high quality so many episodes in? It really blows my mind.  <br>Yeah, I was just thinking to myself how this episode looked surprisingly good<br>You never really hear that Gintama sells great, but it must do pretty well for itself.<br>I suppose I should check out more sales threads</br></br></br>  When will Gintoki stop acquiring new members for his harem?  <br>I don't know about the anime, but the manga sells decently, while the real profits come from the merch sales.</br>  How come anime never mentions capital punishment?  <br><br>The manga is pretty popular sales-wise, but it varies as to where it places in the WSJ rankings. <br><br>However it's one of those weird cases where it could be said that the anime is more popular than the very source material it's based on</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gintama makes enough money  thanks fujos <br><br>Is a respected title too</br></br></br>  <br>About that</br>  <br>He really fucking does look like a gorilla.</br>  <br>Wait before you see under his hakama.</br>  <br>She hasn't shown up after this arc in the manga. She still might, but no idea when.</br>    guys i miss Katsura  <br>He'll be important this season, looking at the anime opening. We're getting the Shogun Amnesia arc (not assassination).</br>  Betting on him coming back with a new arm after this, don't think he's dead. He'll just keep on getting mutilated.  This still pisses me off.  <br><br> Lala's VA is female Gintoki </br></br>  How many gonna be pissed when this arc is eventually animated?  <br><br>All comes together</br></br>  <br><br>He probably moved his organs around like last time.</br></br>  <br>Probably. He's survived fatal injuries before, so he'll probably survive those as well.<br><br>Maybe we'll see tomorrow.</br></br></br>  <br> He'll be important this season, looking at the anime opening. We're getting the Shogun Amnesia arc (not assassination). <br><br>That's like one episode for Katsura's part of it.</br></br></br>  <br>But he's lost to Gintoki, and now to Hijikata and Kondo. He's suffering villain deflation. Is he going to end up fighting Shinpachi?</br>  <br>Hopefully not, but he's not as threatening as he should be. Kinda a shame.</br>  <br>Or two, depending on how they space it out. Still, it's actually an important arc despite not being serious at all.</br>  Who voiced Asaemon?  <br>It would be hilarious for Shinpachi to fight and defeat him, but hopefully he manages to make some kind of recovery to become threatening again, but that's unlikely.</br>  <br>Marina Inoue.</br>  <br>who's that next to toshi</br>  <br>Nagakura Shinpachi.</br>  Think we can keep this going until the spoilers arrive?  <br>There's always more jokes in the earlier parts of the serious Gintama arcs.</br>  <br>Hijikata looks like a bro<br>would eat mayonnaise with all day</br></br>  i got boner  <br>Isn't she Kyubey?</br>  <br>That's Orikasa Fumiko (Rukia of Bleach's VA).</br>    <br>I know i will, first time that Gintoki says something that every girl (even i, no homo) wants to hear</br>  <br>Can't handle him getting ship tease with the best choice?</br>  <br>Pretty much, yes. But Gorilla like to troll us the fuck out</br>  <br>Guess you'll have to live with that. I don't think we'll get an official Gintoki couple at the end, but she has the best and most prominent ship tease with him, and the best dynamic, so if anybody it should be her.</br>  <br> Light Infection <br> Dilemma <br> Kiseki <br> Anagura <br><br>Are you me?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This will be great though (even if it's due to a love potion)</br></br>  <br>Yeah, i can see why people ship them so much (i know i do) but Gintoki will be alone at the end of Gintama, unless he can make Ketsuno Anna his wife like he wants, wich i'd be ok since she's good too</br>  <br>I can just imagine Gorilla hating himself for giving Gintoki that haircut. Must be a bitch to draw every time.</br>  <br>Not so much, Gorilla said a lot of characters are drawn from Shinpachi and he just need to make his hair a little mess up</br>  <br>Can't see him ending up with Ketsuno Ana, but gorilla will probably leave everything open at the end of Gintama.

There's no rush. Don't bother with the rest of them.</br>  <br> virgin <br>you can keep believing that but there have been a lot of nods to the fact that she works as a prostitute too. Even as recent as the last episode where Sacchan says that she only knows how to use her body.</br></br>  <br><br> OP  <br>Light Infection, Tougenkyo Alien, Day x Day <br><br> ED  <br>Balance Doll, Sayonara no Sora, Destiny</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I got it because it was explained in the scanlations I read.</br>  <br>Tsukuyo is virgin.</br>  <br>That's Sacchan insulting her. And she said the only thing she's got going for her is her body, not how to use it.<br><br>Remember, she was still a little girl when she scarred herself and abandoned the path of the courtesan.</br></br></br>  What's the best serious arc?  <br>Courtesan of a Nation for me, with Yoshiwara a close second.</br>  <br>Personally, I believe Shinsengumi Rebellion to be best serious arc.<br><br>Dat showdown between Gin and Strings dude was pretty awesome with him ripping all his joints to break through the strings.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shinsengumi Crisis, with Red Spider a close second. <br><br>Loved seeing Gintoki fight Bansai, as well as otaku Toshi. Too bad Bansai really isn't relevant ever again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Four Devas will be always special.</br>  <br>Four Devas followed by Coutesan of a Nation and Yoshiwara in Flames.</br>  <br><br>Oboro is weird. He kinda reminds me of Aoshi from Kenshin if he wasn't a total jobber. No idea why</br></br>  <br>Gramps and his dog<br>Courtesan of a Nation<br>Four Devas<br><br>Fuck this, when Gintama gets serious, it gets REALLY fucking serious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gramps and his dog <br>That arc is cruel</br></br>  <br>She's a virgin. I remember reading that the gorilla himself admitted that he was trying to make a cool character but ended up making a hopeless virgin instead.</br>  <br>Don't post ghosts without spoilers Anon!</br>   all tsukuyo posts   <br>well mother fuck.</br>  <br> Kondo won again <br><br>Mimawarigumi fags BTFO again.

Is mr.hands going to win the Orimotobowl?</br></br>  Bravo, took mods 4 hours to put down their hot pockets and beat down the last thread.  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>Why are Yahari threads getting kill recently?</br>  <br>Posting best doujin</br>  I am so mad. Which faggot reported the last thread? We haven't done discussing about how pointless shipping war is.  <br>I can't allow you to make the same mistake twice in a row.</br>  Can't wait for Iroha monologue in next Oregairu a.<br><br>I bet it's about how she shifted her attention to a certain sempai and feel dejected because he already had two best girls in school hold interested in him.</br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br> Late as fuck but whatever. </br></br>  <br>Last one violated rules.</br>  <br>Nah, it was just the last one because OP violated rules with NSFW stuff.</br>  <br>Like I haven't read enough of that in jap fanfics already.<br> I really hope it doesn't turn out like any of them </br></br>  Die, Yaharifags.  <br>You're losing your mojo</br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  Am I the only one who played this?  <br>Yeah I Am, slow threads are hard to predict.<br>At least I still get to read them.</br></br>  Hands guy got a rough deal in the anime. The LN was pretty sympathetic to him but in the anime he just seemed like a real life memeposting redditor<br><br>At least he tried to president by himself, unlike Iroha who runs to the nearest cock available before trying to save anything herself.<br><br>Hands deserves the Orimotob owl</br></br></br></br>  Why does Yui call Hikki gross all the time? I thought she had girl feelings for him.<br><br><br> Get's rejected by Hayama, most popular guy in existence <br> aims low next time <br> falls in love with a guy that already has two bombshells in love with him <br>Iroha will get hers soon, right? Maybe she is trying to steal him from them. I wonder if Iroha is trying to keep a low profile around them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do you think hacky Watari got his inspiration from? I bet he copied all the nice ideas in those fanfic into his novel.</br>  <br>Because it's her way of saying "I'm not into you, stop making passes at me"<br><br>Have you never seen "bubbly nice girl is in love with guy" anime before?</br></br></br>  <br> Get's rejected by Hayama, most popular guy in existence <br> aims low next time <br><br>this is a bait, right?</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's all right, I expected it honestly</br>  <br> Because it's her way of saying "I'm not into you, stop making passes at me" <br>So Yui doesn't want 8man making passes at her?<br><br><br>8man is aiming low.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui will never call you kimoi~ </br>  <br>It's two baits in one post.</br>  <br>Wow I'm not banned, the last time I posted NSFW I was<br>You could've been worse, thanks mods</br></br>  <br>Nope Orimoto took the transfer exams for Soubu. Now 8man and Orimoto will ride bikes together to school with Komachi in tow.</br>  Reminder that Oregairu will end with this scene.  <br> implying Iroha ever aim for cunt </br>  <br>No, I was relating it to what Iroha does<br><br>She likes him but is embarrassed by it</br></br></br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>It will happen one day.<br><br><br>Maybe she can join the service club and flirt with Hikigaya in front of Yui/Yukino all day.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying not this </br>  <br>Goddamn, spoiler that disgusting shit</br>   all these anons thinking Iroha is important whatsoever in the series after bringing StuCo problem so the Service Club's relationship could deepen. <br><br>Wake up guys, she's literally there just to attract waifufags</br></br>    <br>She confessed to him and explicitly stated that she likes Hayama. She hasn't done that for 8man.</br>  <br>She confessed to Hayama because she likes 8man</br>  <br> someone this dumb why she always appear after stuco election </br>  <br>Hell no. 8man will stop putting up with Yukino and Yui.<br>He'll make a new service club with Shizukawaii's help. He'll fill it up with black jack and hookers. IE Orimoto, Iroha, Saki, Miura, Ebina and  Komachi </br></br>  <br>Welcome to the family yukino-chan! you are almost as great as my daughter-in-law, Haruno-chan~</br>  <br> confessed with the intention being rejected <br> even cunt know she didnt truly like him </br></br>    <br>the one suffering will be yukino right?</br>  <br>Th..Thanks...Mother.</br>  <br>oh anon, you're as naive as Yui</br>  <br>could it be, you're dead on your feet and want to be put down captain?</br>  <br><br>That is supreme mental gymnastics. That doesn't make a lick of sense.</br></br>  <br>Just finished this shit last night thanks to you faggots, I haven't felt this empty inside in a while.<br><br>At least Yahari is safe from an ending this heartbreaking. Watari wouldn't do something like that,  r-right? </br></br></br>    <br>OTP</br>  <br>atleast she didn't pull a Yui<br> propose shit idea hoping it would work <br> get rejected <br> Lol I knew you'd reject it, I was just being retarded. <br><br>Iroha also knew that would never get enough points even if she was super serious about it, she knows how bad Yumiko's situation is.<br><br>Now she just has to rack up enough points with 8man, so she doesn't get rejected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That is supreme mental gymnastics <br>Welcome to Oregairu<br><br><br>He's going to knock it out of the park by going for an "everyone loved Hayama and was just using 8man to get close to him" ending</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you are wrong anon.<br>Haruno will have the pleasure of meeting pic related.</br></br>  <br>Yui is tsundere.</br>  <br>Yui succeeded in making everyone be more genuine with their feelings. Yukino is going to open up and there will be a fair and not hurtful love triangle ahead.<br><br><br>Really? She has been pure unrefined dere for a while now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Welcome to Oregairu <br><br>Now I am doubting the interpretation of the scene at s2 ep8 and final episode. Does anybody really felt the scene that way or everybody just eat up whatever explanation they get their hand on?</br></br></br></br>  <br>naive? or desesperate? I don't know anymore.</br>  How can anyone not be a Yuifag after seeing her 20 years in the future? She is going to age like wine.<br><br>I wonder if she wanted to talk to Hikki-kun because she wanted to see if Yui liked him.</br></br>  <br>Yui fans have always been naive AND desperate.</br>   Come back to 4chan after a week <br> Yahari Threads not dead yet. <br><br>Seriously...<br> Don't let it die! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because there is more of love than the eyes.<br><br>You don't marry a vase, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit are you me? I also picked that up and finished it last night thanks to these faggots.</br>  <br> he doesnt know iroha already interested with 8man from this scene <br>iroha even stated in this episode she aim hayama for popularity only</br></br>  <br> Some random guy starts messaging Haruno on Facebook <br> She thinks it's he's pretty cute from the profile pics and genuinely enjoys the conversation <br> She gives in and finally asks to meet somewhere for coffee. <br> Online no one knows you're a truck <br><br><br> succeeded in making everyone be more genuine <br><br>all she did was force 8man to hit the reset button on the bullshit atmosphere again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because there is more of love than the eyes. <br>*Only in 2D</br></br>  <br>Because 8man is a denialfag.</br>  <br>I find her depressing. Not because she'll never be real but because she's pretty much the incarnation of a typical housewife. Somewhat like an amplified force of gravity she pulls you down and you can never escape. She is the enemy of ambition. Truly I feel sorry for Gahamma papa.</br>  <br>She used to be one at the very beginning when Watari hasn't even figured out what to do with his characters.</br>  <br>That was why 8man was invited over<br><br>Yui knows exactly what she's doing. The 8manb owl ended right then and there.</br></br></br>  <br>I did.<br>I was a Yukinofag.</br></br>  <br>Lies. She's always been a fake genki with low-self esteem. Reread/rewatch the cookie scene.</br>  Irohasu~~~  <br>The very definition of a tsundere is insecure person who can't admit their feelings and resort to violence, verbal or physical while fuming about it.<br><br>It's just that later we know why she kept her guard around 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>義理チョコはす～</br>  <br>are you retard?</br>  Posting a very rare pic.  <br><br>I have so many questions about Yahari unanswered which is why I am still in these threads looking for answers, but most of the posts I see is about shipping.</br></br>  <br>セーターはす～</br>  <br>asuna</br>  <br>Why does Totsuka-kun look more cute in girls' clothes, I wonder?</br>  <br>I mostly come here to shitpost and complain about characters not getting adequate anime screentime<br><br>What answers are you going to find here?</br></br></br>  So, let's review season 2:<br>Yukino became an even bigger bitch;<br>Komachi had a huge bitch moment, probably PMS (really hope for 8man she doesn't get this way every month, not even my own sister was this bad);<br>Yui is suffering continually while being ignored by 8man (his shittaste is palpable);<br>Sensei is useless as always, also she pushes 8man to sacrifice himself for Yukino;<br>Haruno turned totally chaotic evil for fucking real;<br>Saki basically disappeared;<br>Totsuka was empty and unimportant as much as he was in S1;<br>Zaimokuza was totally cut out from the anime while he was actually useful in the novels for once;<br>Hayama turned from a medium-level cunt to THE cunt;<br>Tobe is retarded as fuck, even more than what he let out;<br>Ebina isn't just a simple rotten girl;<br>Miura is better than expected;<br>Rumirumi striked back even more wonderful than before;<br>Megurin is comfy as fuck just as usual;<br>the new entry Iroha was way way way better than expected.<br>the other new entry Orimoto turned from a boss-level bitch to one of the most amazing wannabe allies;<br>finally, the true revelation of S2, without him there wouldn't have been any "comedy": TAMA-fucking-NAWA. The living meme.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no Ranpo Kitan with Totsuka as MC <br><br><br>tl;dr lots of actual character development and a lot of mildly forced drama</br></br></br></br>  <br>I usually came here for LN news and to kill time with the ship wars. <br><br>This /a/ after all you won't get many answers.</br></br></br>  <br>I was empty and unimportant, huh?</br>  <br>Yeah you could achieve more by just checking Spyro's blog</br>  <br>You can't fool me, no one is this retarded.</br>  <br>Why does she have an ahoge?</br>  <br>8mom and Yukimom are sisters</br>  <br><br> What answers are you going to find here? <br><br>Who wrote this? How does he do it? I sucked at reading people so I want to find the secret behind it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>8man has an ahoge<br>Yukino has an ahoge<br>It was meant to be</br></br></br>  <br>You only served to some cheap laughs about 8man questioning his sexuality nothing else. Even Zaimokuza got a frienship moment with 8man.</br>  <br>Why did Yui shoo Yuimom away? Does Yui know that Yuimom knows that Yui love's Hikki-kun?<br><br>I wonder if Yuimom knows the extent of her daughter's affection for 8man. She probably thinks it is a simple crush but Yui seems to be in deep love with him.</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is a domestic abuser, abusing her mom by forcefully shoving her out of the room<br>She doesn't deserve 8man</br></br>  <br>Because "go away mom you're embarrassing me in front of my buddies" is something every teenager goes through<br><br> well, I assume so at least. I never had any friends for my mom to embarrass me in front of </br></br></br>  Where's his left hand going?  <br>Komachi</br>  <br>8man see Yui as a dog.<br>Dogs show unconditional love to anyone.<br>Genuine love.<br><br>It was meant to be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino became an even bigger bitch <br><br>Wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuimom was embarrassing her by saying she talks about Hikki all the time. Yui couldn't even face 8man after that and looked toward Yuki when she said that Yuimom was excited to meet "you."</br>  <br>True.</br>  <br>8man = bear<br>Yukino = cat<br>bear + cat = panda --&gt; pan-san<br>8man has fish eyes<br>pan-san has fish eyes<br><br>Sorry, only genuine symbolism allowed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I had never expirience that. My friends become really shy in front of the family of other persons, I have more fun seein them struggle on how to act and avoid acting stupid.</br>  <br>On his sister's thigh.</br>  <br><br> “Sh-shut up!” Yuigahama’s face burned red in anger. A plastic bag and some greaseproof paper came flying my way. Even though she hit me, the fact that she chose things that wouldn’t hurt means she’s actually pretty nice. Wait…could that possible mean she likes me? Or was that just a joke? As if I could go through that experience again. <br><br>She was a tsundere, but at that point she is already a nice girl™ in 8man's monologues.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you say pan-san?</br>  <br> 8man <br> not a bat </br></br>    <br>It's time.</br>  Hourly reminder that  Isshiki resides in Hayama   <br> Yukinofags feel so threatened by Yui, to the point that they have to photoshop her out of every fan arts. <br><br>Gets me every time.</br></br></br>  why the fuck are you guys still shitposting when based spyro has finally delivered?<br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/#p<wbr>art-3</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Hayama getting pegged by Iroha while he watches Haruno and 8man go at it confirmed.</br>  <br> Miura district. <br><br>You debunked your own point.</br></br></br>  <br>because I'm too busy reading manga on my other monitor to read the translated chapters</br>  <br>A single Yukinofag did that anon<br>How about I judge Yuifags for the  wait Yuifags still post here? that's a surprise I thought you turned into skellys a long time ago </br></br>  <br> she talks about Hikki all the time. <br>Do you really think Yui talks about Hikki that much?<br><br> Yuimom was excited to meet "you." <br>I didn't get that part because it is obvious Yukinon was an afterthought.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't the reason I made that shoop at all, I was simply having fun with PS.</br>  <br>I can´t belive no one had change their faces.</br>  <br>because I've already read Vol11</br>  <br>hyp</br>  <br>There was one with Yui's face but I didn't download it</br>  <br/>  YY times 2 getting BTFO by Gahamama. <br><br>Isn't it time 8man makes the right choice?</br></br>  <br>It's happening!</br>  <br> She placed her index finger to her chin and cutely tilted her head. “There’s like no school events around this time of the year and the VP’s taking care of all the small stuff for me. All I have left is just to stamp our year-end report.” <br> finger to her chin and cutely tilted her head <br> and cutely tilted <br> cutely <br>Iroha end confirmed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, now I can shitpost with that one instead</br>  <br>Nobody cares about the LN.<br>We are all animeonlyfags.</br></br>  <br> &gt;she talks about Hikki all the time. <br> Do you really think Yui talks about Hikki that much? <br>It's literally what Yuimom said.<br><br> I didn't get that part because it is obvious Yukinon was an afterthought. <br>Yui said that to Yukino because she was too embarrassed to look at 8man after what Yuimom said.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Guys I don't know if the time is right. The mods just killed the last thread. I don't think they're asleep yet.  <br>Talk for yourself.</br>  NO! NO! NO!<br>Irohafags starting to shitpost again!<br>What should we do?</br></br>  <br>Reading biased translations by a Yukinofag</br>  <br>I believe your theory is a little flawed</br>  <br> It's literally what Yuimom said. <br>I thought that was parent talk.<br><br>I guess she doesn't want to let on she is madly in love with him? The only person who never noticed it was Yukino and even she got the message.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Compared to most LN series the % of us that have read the source material is probably pretty high<br><br>Most LNs are very poorly translated</br></br></br>  <br>All I'm getting from this is Yukino really doesn't like Iroha.</br>  <br>I wonder why, I thought she would be happy to have another girl around.</br>   Hmm, that’s funny, the chest that’s puffing out looks a lot smaller… Is the perspective off or something? In any case, I’ll go ahead and request that be fixed for the Blu-Rays! <br><br>Hachiman's monologue for Yui, Chapter 1.<br><br>What happened, Yuifags?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought that was parent talk. <br>It could be. But either way, Yui pushed Yuimom out of the room for the same reason.</br></br>  <br>Of course she doesn't. She's trying to NTR her hard since 3 volumes already. Yui is too much of a nice girl, somebody needs to stop her, after all.  I still hope she'll win the 8manbowl though, those 2 doesn't deserve the 8incher. </br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1278155 <br><br> That attitude caused me to make a bitter smile. <br> Isshiki, her behavior, and her speech were charming, but there were several reasons why her actions didn’t affect me all that much in the present. Had I been myself from long ago, I’d lose my wits within the instant, no doubt about it. <br><br> didn’t affect me all that much <br><br>Iroha end deconfirmed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is not as if Yuimom would ask if he was going out with Yui or anything. Maybe she would have asked if he had a GF or if he liked older women.</br>  <br> Komachi had a huge bitch moment, probably PMS (really hope for 8man she doesn't get this way every month, not even my own sister was this bad); <br>Do not remind me. I still can't believe there's people who dare to compare her to Miya or Mikan.</br></br>  <br> says the Yukinofag </br>  <br>Watari is pissed that FEEL removed Yui's yui.</br>  <br>how can you NTR someone that isn't in a relationship?</br>  <br>God I'd love to see how a conversation between Yuimom and 8man plays out.</br>   Isshiki coughed to check her throat, sent me a single upwards glance, and immediately looked away. <br><br> She tightly gripped one hand at the bosom of her uniform while the other weakly trembled and adjusted her skirt. With moist eyes, the breaths she let out were hot. <br><br> Then, she spoke in fragments. <br><br> “Do you hate… younger girls?” <br><br> I…… do not! Yeah! If you had to ask, I absolutely loved them! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No not really, if I remember correctly, Iroha is like a sister (or just a kouhai) to her, she spoils Iroha as much as 8man does. This is stated later in the novel, just wait for it.</br>  <br>Miya had a pretty fucked-up reaction in one of the game's bad endings, though.</br>  <br> yomiuri giants </br>  <br>Don't think 8man wants to be a bear anymore.</br>  <br>No! I'm saying that I don't get the chance to shitpost because Volume 11 doesn't contain much for us.</br>   Yuigahama tapped her hands. “Oh, but hey, Hikki seems like he’d be compatible with an older girl, for sure…! I think, definitely.” <br><br> She squeezed her fist, putting a lot of strength into it. But I certainly didn’t have that obsession, yes. <br><br>where is your god now, Yuifags.</br></br></br></br>   I found myself nodding in conjunction with Isshiki, and we somehow looked like a couple <br> :^) </br>  <br>Lurk more.</br>  <br>It was said in context of Haruno.<br>Harunofags BTFO!<br> Are there any Harunofags left? </br></br></br>  <br> Irohafags selective reading <br><br> “…That’s not really applicable here.

It certainly didn’t feel that way because she didn’t show the least amount of respect, honor, respect, and respect towards me, so she didn’t feel like an underclassman at all… <br><br> 3x respect <br><br>what is this? Google translate?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “…You seem rather informed.” Yukinoshita smiled firmly. Though it’s closer to the smile of Nikkari Aoe than just a pleasant smile, so there was a transparent feeling of pressure oozing from it. <br><br>Yukino is not very happy this chapter.<br>Also no idea who Nikkari Aoe really is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>English is a shitty language.</br>  <br>I played it a few years ago, and I don't remember anything related to what the heck you're talking about.<br>Komachi is still a shitty sister, though.</br></br>  <br>She'll win him over through strength of determination one day.

At least have some Max Coffee™ and sweets." <br> "Well she already laid some snacks in Yui's room and who can pass up on free Max Coffee™." He thought.

You're sucking away at it so greedily just like a baby." <br> He gets up to thank her and make his way home. <br> But. "Oh my, it's gotten so late. I don't think it would be safe for you to be heading home right now. You should spend the night here in Yui's room." <br> "Ehhh. Besides the fact that it'd be wrong for me to sleep in a girl's room at her parent's house, I don't think I can fall asleep anytime soon after all that Max Coffee™." <br> "Then I'd think you should spend some time trying some these snacks. I guarantee you, you won't be able to get up after trying a couple of these.

Are those the discussion you wished for,  kun?<br><br> Read that in Haruno's voice, bitches </br></br></br></br></br>  Did anyone else totally see the love triangle coming?  <br>I honestly believe Irohafags make YYfags butthurt enough to have actual discussions.</br>  <br>Read  anon.<br>It pretty much describes Yukino's thoughts and development.</br></br>  <br> Those are the lyrics to the OP, Anon. </br>  <br>Yes, that's right. Yukino also took advantage of Iroha's question to determine 8man's thoughts on younger girls (she is younger than him).<br><br> “The problem is what qualifies someone as younger. Their school year? Birthday? Are they younger if their birthday is somewhat early…? The definition’s rather vague. I believe we should sort that out first, don’t you think?” Yukinoshita said, blabbering on. <br><br>Yukino usually blabbers when she is going dere dere.</br></br></br></br></br>   “After all, we’re dealing with boys here who know absolutely nothing about handmade sweets. So, handmade chocolates is a piece of cake. It doesn’t cost much to make a lot and you can add your finishing touches by customizing each one to your liking. The boys will be all over them.” <br> Isshiki placed the tip of her finger on her lips to think and opened her mouth. <br><br>“Actually, that would put me over my budget.”<br><br>“I don’t know exactly how much you plan on making, but you’re under a rather severe budget if you’re limiting yourself to less than 130 yen a piece…” Yukinoshita said in disbelief, rubbing her temple. That, however, wasn’t a concern.<br><br>Poorfag detected</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminds me of the good days.........</br>  <br>Why would Yukino care about 8man's preferences in girls?</br>  <br><br><br>But it's not actual discussion, right?<br>Just proxies.<br><br>Stop hiding your thought behind the quotes. Voice your own opinion. Write your own sentence. It won't genuine otherwise.<br><br> Just joking, trying to mimic Haruno/Sensei's tone for once. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wants to know so she can be the best effective platonic friend she can be for him.</br>  <br> Irohafags calling any otherfags denial <br><br>Ebin meme :D</br></br></br>  <br>this is bait right, denial-kun?</br>  <br>Don't know anon. Do you know of a feeling called love?</br>    <br>I don't understaand.....</br>  <br>Poorly meme'd denial-chan, surely you could do much better than this.</br>  <br>wakaranai.</br>  <br>You forget that even yukino herself doesn't know what the fuck she feels, being a total emotional mess and all that.</br>   Like mainly from an income perspective! The important thing was that they could take care of me. And in regards to that, Komachi was perfect. She possessed the talent to become a top breeder. <br><br> Now you just made me imagine what a slightly older Komachi would look like. </br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it gets worse when he sees her in an apron. His levels of denialfaggotry are very high this volume.<br><br>Now, I'm just one moonfag but, at least for me it seems that 8man treats Iroha very differently when double YY is around. If any other moonfags could agree or disagree with me, that'd be nice.</br></br></br>  /a/, what is the most disturbing thing you've ever read/seen in a hentai?  <br/>  <br>this series</br>  <br>Not the one you posted.</br>  <br> loli on /h/ </br>  the one about Junko Furuta  Though I've probably stumbled upon worse things as the years have worn on, I think this is what broke whatever semblance of personhood I had left upon entering here.  <br> disturbing <br>Decapitation ceremony.<br>Nothing's really hit me like that before.</br></br></br>  this image seriously triggers me upon seeing it in the catalog  <br> Tags: defloration, guro <br>A little redundant now, don't you think?</br></br>  <br>I've never seen anything disturbing, because I know to avoid that shit.</br>  This one where this guy provides this assisted suicide service and this girl asks if he can make it so that she gets shot in the head, but stays conscious so that she can play with her brains as they fall out.  The shock didn't really hit me until a few days later. Fuck Quzilax.<br>Happy lolis are best lolis</br>  every time i think i read something deeply disturbing i find that months or even years later someone manages to top it with something even more horrifying. <br><br>but what disturbed me the most wasnt anything new i read. it was when i would come across it some time later and be able to fap to the very thing i once read that was once so horrible. <br><br>this is porn after all. one gets tired of vanilla, then you get tired of NTR. you go through all the fetishes at some point, coming across great artist or stories, given its all porn. but at some point you get tired of it all, since most of it is pretty much the same shit regurgitated over and over. <br><br>thats when you read shit that horrified you and you now find it erotic in an exciting new way. <br><br>like lately, i sometimes like to watch the first OP of future diary just to watch the part with yunos feet drenched in blood. it has become strangely erotic. the bare naked foor draped in blood. <br><br>no porn will ever be truly horrifying as the depth of people who continue to push those boundaries seeking to be even more shocking and erotic than whatever is the current champion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "I'M CUMMING FROM MY BROTHER'S DECAPITATED HEAD!" <br>I had a little chuckle there.</br></br>  <br>yeah it's easy to avoid the fetishes that would lead you to that shit, but sometimes you get curious.<br><br>as for me when I first came to 4chan I was greeted with the holes manga. Taught me all I needed to know about 4chan.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What?</br></br>  Holes, so many holes, they feel so good to fill.  Your mother.  <br/>  <br><br>Care to explain anon?</br></br>  <br>I know this idea gets pushed around a lot, but you have to realize that not everyone seeks more and more fucked up shit. You have to admit you're just as fucked up. I mean I just go deeper and deeper into the world of dicks. I look at you sad saps with a healthy amount of pity, and not just because you're so wretched, but because you tell yourselves comfortable little lies about how everyone else engages in this pursuit of depravity.</br>  <br>Probably that one bara hentai where the guy has a rat go into his anus.<br><br>It was posted here when it was announced it was going to get an animation.</br></br></br>  I make sure to avoid the disturbing stuff.  <br>This is actually sad because you know it's real.</br>  <br>Holes manga? Is that the one where the chick gets a bunch of puss-filled holes on her ass in the train and then masturbates with them? I read half of that, now that I think about it. I guess that's my answer to OP's question.</br>  <br>For the love of god I need some source on this.</br>  <br> I mean I just go deeper and deeper into the world of dicks. <br>Is this not admiting to the same search for stronger stimulation that you're banging on against?</br></br>  <br>funny thing<br><br>years before I read that I had nightmares about my dead grandpa having large gaping holes throughout his body for some reason. Needless to say I wasn't amused when reading it.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently it's a common dream, the holes thing.</br>  THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!<wbr>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<wbr>!!</wbr></wbr>  Cement girl  <br>Applicant for Death I think.</br>  <br>probably for the best<br><br>because the worst part of looking at disturbing stuff is not getting disgusted by it<br><br>its getting aroused by it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Applicant for Death is one of my favorites, but by my current standards it's quite tame.</br></br>  <br>I would reject the notion that guro is depraved in someway. Guro pursues a far more complex level of ecstasy than standard hentai. The mix of the pain of extravagant, visceral death coupled with sensual, thrilling eroticism gives the ecstasy an immediacy and finality which goes far beyond the basic levels of sexual ecstasy which is supplemented often with a betrayal of taboos of pedophilia and incest or whatever else in hentai.</br>  <br><br>The fear of holes is called trypophobia. It's quite common.</br></br>  <br>Thanks kinda anon!</br>  <br>Have to ask what your current standards are then.</br>  <br>What about apathy? because I get that a lot.</br>  <br>It's based on this and doesn't really hold back on showing the worst of it.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murde<wbr>r_of_Junko_Furuta</wbr></br></br>  <br>nah apathy is ok</br>  <br>I have to admit that I've seen a bit of the fucked up stuff, but it usually goes so far that it becomes silly.</br>  <br>I thought it was heartwarming.<br><br><br>Quite fucked up. Anything featuring gore and insect infestation (centipedes) is crossing the line.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This</br></br>  <br>I hate humans sometimes.</br>  <br>Fuck i remember this. It haunts me to this day.</br>  <br>even when I first read it I was of the mindset that "rape = saying hello in hentai" so naturally when the doujin came where the girl gets raped I was like "fap fap fap"<br><br>but then it just went on, and on, and on, 100+ pages of a girl getting tortured in a traumatic fashion and she isn't enjoying any bit of it. Eventually you want it to stop, that someone would save her or that she would escape, but it doesn't happen. The torture just keeps happening until she begs for death and dies.<br><br>Worst part of it is that it's based on a true story and the and fuckers that did it were released years ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I fap AND laugh to those</br>  <br> insect infestation <br>I'm reminded of that one doujin on sadpanda that was basically just a school getting overrun with brain eating insects.<br> A lesbian gets brain munched while shlicking in a bathroom. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's pretty fucke-<br><br> 16 chapters </br></br></br>   Geiger Counter <br> Girl in Concrete  <br>Two names that send me into a spiral of depression. The worst part is I can't talk about it with anybody. <br><br>What the fuck am I going to say? That I read through comics depicting brutal realistic rape and torture? I want my innocence back.</br></br></br></br>  The one with the girl letting the fake radiation tester guy into her house  <br>start a support group</br>  I read some yaoi hentai the other day where some guy got his dick hole pulled open and had semen jammed back into his dick.  <br> "Hi my name is anon and I came across a manga that upset me very much"  <br> "Faggot!" </br></br>  <br>Hentai Recovery Anonymous</br>  <br> Artist: Uziga Waita <br>He seems like a pretty cool guy. <br>I'd like to see someone drive in this.</br></br></br>  <br> implying this isn't happening and being accepted right now <br> TRIGGERED </br></br>  <br>Why not just leave? I mean it was a jap house too, so even if she dove out the fucking window if wouldn't be more than two storeys.<br><br><br>Uziga Waita is the best. He makes the most sinister shit.<br><br>http://g.e-hentai.org/g/343729/81d2<wbr>4c0b2c/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you make it I will use it</br>  <br>I shouldn't have looked this up.</br>  <br> Why not just leave? <br>Fear probably. Fear makes you do stupid, irrational things.<br> I haven't read it (nor do I want to), so I'm just guessing </br></br></br>  This is what happens when people embrace "board culture" and "home board" where people think a single board is the entire website.<br>One step closer to /v/, etc.</br>  <br>That weird touhou doujin I came across where Reisen gets drugged and raped frequently. Then she gets a forced abortion of her belly getting punched or some shit. Then she's allowed to give birth to the 2nd pregnancy. And both she and her child were forced into sex slavery.<br><br>It was great.</br></br></br>  <br>I once watched this three-part hentai. This hentai was extremely disturbing. In the first part, this man goes to a restaurant and meets this young and cute waitress. He later finds out that the "waitress" is actually a crossdressing shota, but that doesn't stop the two from loving each other. In the second episode, the man is gone and the episode now focuses on the shota. At the start, it shows the shota (who's blonde by the way), in his underwear, swimming, when he meets a new shota with red hair. The two shotas then go to the latter's how, where they see things such as the redhaired shota's sister masturbating, and the redhaired shota showing the blonde shota a toy. In the third and final episode, the two shotas then meet another shota, this time looking very feminine with long black hair. It was so disturbing that all I can remember is that at some point the three shotas pee on a hill. The hentai was probably one of the most disturbing things I have ever watched.</br>  <br>but once people start shoving fireworks up your guys that fear should turn into "I need to get out of here no matter what". But yeah, maybe she was wired differently, or just too damaged to do shit except take more abuse.<br><br>and you should read that story. It's pretty great and very effecting. Shit stays with you.</br></br></br>  <br>YOU ARE ALL FREE NOW!</br>  <br> actually describing all the boku no pico episodes  <br>For what purpose?</br></br>  <br>And I thought Juan Gotoh was bad...</br>  <br> forgot the part where they have a threesome on Tokyo fucking Tower <br><br>You failed.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably the latter. She actually did try to escape and nearly reached the phone before they caught her.</br>  <br>I've never seen it, but now with this confirmation, I know now what I'm avoiding.</br>  <br>Mai-chan's daily life is much more grotesque but the stuff happening in there is just so bizarre it borders on parody (like that "BABY FUCK AWWRIGHTT")<br><br>This one is just depressing on a whole new level</br></br></br>  <br>God I don't want to read it, but I'm so fucking curious.</br>  <br>And the president getting a lobotomy.</br>  <br>Fucking dammit, I thought if I waited someone'd source this by namedrop, now I have to be the newfag that asks for sauce twice in one thread.</br>  <br>Read it faggot</br>  <br>silly boy, /a/ IS your support group!</br>  <br>You gotta wonder about the people who draw and get off to this kind of shit.</br>  <br>Are you not white and do you say "yoooo" a lot?<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0T<wbr>6go6EOuG4</wbr>  [ ] </br></br>  <br>Read it. It's great.</br>  IT'S AWWWWWWWRIGHT  <br><br> tortured girl ground into fine powder to be sold as chink medicine. <br><br>And I wondered why people bought that shit. I have been missing out!</br></br></br></br>  That one weird ass doujin where the guy documents with photos all his fellatio experiments, including a toothless girl, a rotting corpse, and his own severed head.  <br>Just look at the thumbnails, that's what I did.<br>It's a good way to get the gist of what fucked everyone up without fucking yourself up.</br></br>  <br>it's called Suck It<br>Shintaro Kago is a guro master.</br></br>  <br> Suck it <br>Kek</br></br>  I remember seeing one a long time ago where a guy adopts all these children so that he can have a cannibal feast with his colleagues. Some they squeeze apart, like literal tubes filled with shit to eat, others rape to death, mutilate to death, some being cooked alive, and all end up being eaten. Then, they still aren't satisfied and do the same with each other. Eye fucking, "I'm cumming inside your brain", the standard. Last survivor cannibalizes himself to death.  "Holes"<br><br>That one series with the cure blonde tomboy loli that just gets raped and beaten for multiple issues, i just hate how good the art and the characters look and then its nothing but sadism shit.</br></br>  <br>I want to read this.</br>  <br>"Holes" followed by that series where a girl gets off on increasingly incredibly painful bodily harm.<br><br>The latter is kind funny but it makes me squeeze my balls. Yick, too much.<br><br>I feel like you're more curious about the most disturbing thing I've ever fapped to, but I dunno, I've fapped to a lot of messed up shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why the fuck am I still reading this thread  <br> followed by that series where a girl gets off on increasingly incredibly painful bodily harm. <br>I remember someone dumped that series here not too long ago.  I wished I could forget it. </br></br>  <br>Yeah, I had to stop reading.<br><br>It was surprisingly difficult to stop, but I managed.</br></br></br>  <br>Wondering the same thing mate.</br>  <br>Oh shit I think I remember that thread. It was where she got bait or insects stuck in places and also she got hooked her clit or something like that.</br>  <br>someone made manga out based on Naked Blood?</br>  Not even sure if it was a hentai but i remember reading a series of a weird animal family in a zoo. The part that made me question myself was the part where the talking toilet was eating shit and talking about life. Obviously not as disturbing as some others mentioned here, but it still had me thinking what I was doing with my life.  <br>I think so, was it the one where the girl got off mutilating her own pussy, to the point where she's shoving bugs up her snatch and has to go to the hospital.  Then another chapter where she shoves it in some pipe or a hole in a fence and it ends up prolapsing, also a dog ends up ripping a chunk of her prolapse vag.  That's the one you're talking about right.</br>  <br><br>ayy got a name for this? sounds hot</br></br>  This thread makes me worry about the people who actually come up and raw this shit.  Jesus tap dancing christ.<br><br>Did I suddenly become too normie for /a/?<br><br>I thought I had it going good, for the past 8 years being here.<br><br>But jesus fucking christ. It always gets me. You win fuckers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127814635 <br><br>Found it, it's Chitsu Hakai-kei Joshi/Chitsu Hakai-kei Joshi 2 (for the dog one). Have fun every one.</br></br>  <br>This and only this.</br>   anime cartoon porn   Oysters stuff generally, his latest work really hit it home with the fucked up factor with the last chapter.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/813209/ec4ebb<wbr>702b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830142/4826ab<wbr>264e/ (last chapter) <br><br>The worst part is that this artist is forming a really fucked up lore and universe with all of his works referencing one another.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  Euphoria just about did it for me I'm all for classic forced love but shit is just one thing I just can't take without dry retching. Its repulsive and downright unhealthy.  <br>How about the people who spend hours activly translating or redrawing it</br>  <br>Be glad they know the difference between fantasy and reality.<br>Most of the people complaining about how utterly vile stuff like this should be banned don't understand the difference. It's that latter type that's more dangerous than anything.</br></br>  Mentos and Scooby doo<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/722925/a0c310<wbr>c12a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/763259/ad56d4<wbr>2040/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I once watch this weird Hentai that turn into boarder line incest rape.</br>  <br> Fantasy  <br> Reality <br>Keep these two separate from each other and you will do just fine. Failure to do so should then account for your own self termination via Shotgun Mouthwash, no need to start hurting others because some little voice told you to.</br></br></br>  <br>That must have been absolutely traumatizing</br>  <br> tfw one of them has just gotten out of prison recently <br>just shows that you don't need to be a dindu to get away with torturing a girl for a month straight. All you need is to be underage, off the rails and you will get a slap on the hand.</br></br>  <br>Oysters stuff always dances just on the very edge of being outright guro at times, making it really messed up. I remember cringing really hard when some poor kid got his balls smashed, you don't see it except for a puddle of blood but damn, shit was rough.<br><br> Here's the page: http://exhentai.org/s/ecffe23b6f/66<wbr>8884-76</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br> apathy is OK <br>only if you're a psychopathy</br></br>  Some Oyster hmanga I guess. It wasn't really that bad but whatever.<br>Something about a family being sold into slavery and mindbroken.</br>  <br>I remember reading this years ago thinking it wasn't that bad. A bit fucked up but it was just some edgy porn for gurofags. THEN I found out that it was based on a true story and that some poor girl actually went through all this. <br><br>After reading all about the case I reread the doujin and felt like I was going to be sick. I'm all for freedom of expression for artists and all, but for real; what the fuck inspires someone to sexualize such a case?</br></br></br>  Not a porn one, but that were They send the orphan girls to a prison to be raped and tortured by the prisoners for polítical reasons (yes, I Know, edgystuff). The chapter when a new prison guard has to watch one of the girl's throught the hole night So that she doesn't commit suicide, and to avoid those attemps he tell's her that if she can pass a whole weekend, she will get his freedom again, was really hard to me.  <br>i still remember that crap it was really fuck up</br>  How about some  FETUS STOMPING ?<br>http://exhentai.org/g/661351/6bb61b<wbr>2e71/<br><br>And for the page: http://exhentai.org/s/fe749b75ce/66<wbr>1351-48</wbr></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I also think there was scat too</br>  <br>come to think of it, I remember thinking Suicide School was worse than that.</br>  why does this Uziga Waita faggot exist? what do his parents think of him? why does he do this? what caused him to do this?  <br>tfw you already have it favourited. Shame, I was hoping it was something new.<br><br><br>I'm listening.</br></br></br></br>  This was pretty brutal.  <br>Why do you care? Its not like he has acutally done this to people yet you make it sound like he has. Its fucking fictional depiction of potentially real events that are currently happening right now. Don't think about it just read it and be glad that its not you getting your balls clamped in a vice.</br>  <br>Kawady Max is like Waita Uziga for the soul.<br>Together with Oyster he's one of the mangakas whose works I avoid like the plague.</br></br>  <br>i don't get it</br>  <br> MASTURBATE OR WE MAKE YOU FUCK THE DOG AGAIN <br> I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO YOU TRYING TO MAKE UP WITH YOUR DAUGHTER! YOU HABEN'T EVEN MAKE HER COME ONCE! <br>My sides.<br>Also, where's your pic from?<br>There's so much in this thread I'm loosing track.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>edgy</br>  <br>Its a harsh truth m8 don't try to ignore what is currently happening.</br>  <br>I prefer his older works rather than his new works. Rape is my fetish, and he's good at it. But well, his new works I think are a bit too much, also, the artstyle is not as appealing as his older works.</br>  <br><br>Why is that Idiot girl not telling, The worse thing that could happen is he going to kill you or something. <br><br>Face your fears Faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright I just got done reading this and now I really wish I hadn't. thats gonna keep me fucked up for the rest of the day and now I'm going to try my best to try to forget this. Please hold me anons</br>  <br>I wasn't sure of who to feel sorry for in that pic, the daughter thats getting raped or the dog preparing itself for a second round.</br>  <br>Is from . If you get bored just skip to the last chapter he posted (it isn't bundled with the rest yet for some reason). I recommend the artists other works, especially the ones with supernatural elements to them for 2spooky horror faps. <br><br><br>How many fetus stomping doujins do you think exist?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Please hold me anons <br>Thats what the should have said to Junko before they stuffed her in concrete. Harden up</br></br>  <br>Sauce.<br>Oh god souce.</br></br>  <br>Well at least  it's based on the true story of Junko Furuta who never got any justice </br>  <br>I dunno mayne, one can always hope for more.</br>  <br>She does later on.  But only after the grandfather dies ontop of her while he was raping her, leaving her pinned under his dead body with his penis still inside her for 3 days until her parents return home. Causing her to go utterly insane and sent off to a loonybin where she gets raped more while having demonic hallucinations of her grandfather saying he's going to come back for her. </br>  i do this thing where i don't watch much of torture in hentai but i can watch some very violent animes or manga like elfin lied and shamo. I don't know why I'm so inconsistent with these things  <br>Probably not the most fucked up or disturbing visually but just imaging the concept was a real boner killer.<br><br>Was the sakuya hentai where a guy fucks her while she's giving birth because he doesn't want to wait and pushes the baby back with his dick and just fucks it to death in her vagina til it's just a mix of juices.</br></br></br>  <br>haha<br><br>that's crazy!</br></br></br>  <br>wow Japan has some shitty behavioral health centers</br>  <br>i guess its the same reason why people watch stuff like saw or hostile</br>  <br>I need this.</br>  <br>To be fair most asylums were rape centers when it came to female patients.</br>  <br>The only doujinshi I never finished was about a girl obsessed with sticking things in her vagina and shit goes out of control when she puts this weird fishbait leech that grabs hold of her clit and she starts destroying her vagina to get it off eventually ripping her clit off.<br><br>I could not finish that, could not even try, wasn't even a third of the way done and it gets worse, nah fuck that.</br></br></br>  <br>Yooo, what the fuck...</br>  <br> Makes me wish I worked at one, to be honest. </br>  Who /St.Margareta/ here?  <br>Good thing about this is how its relevance can be applied with your current life situations and unfortunate events that may hit you. Meaning that everything bad that maybe happening to you could be a hell of a lot worse if you were her.<br> Hey I lost my job today I feel sad now <br>It could be worse you could have been kidnapped and raped multiple times over the space of a week with nothing but a can of your own crap to feed you<br> Oh no she dumped me now my life has no meaning <br>At least you haven't got a pack of lit fire crackers stuffed up your ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you can get off on scat?</br>  <br>The worst thing about this is that these cases aren't all that uncommon, in fact I can imagine the ISIS doing it right now.</br>  <br>Aye, I love it.<br>Only girls and/or lesbians though.<br> I even draw it sometimes. </br></br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/677867/a1415e<wbr>11e9/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/689748/e8af5e<wbr>8f70/<br>The ones on the top of my head.</br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>i don't want to judge you so i will stop talking</br>  <br><br><br>It's pretty fucked. There's also another subplot about another girl who came from a really neglectful home due to her deadbeat parents. They stick a burning hot iron on her back causing half of the flesh to rip off, leaving a massive scar. She goes crazy and loses her long term memory. The friends she makes in the insane asylum she always forgets them the next morning, acting like they just met. It's pretty grim stuff.<br><br>Then you get comedy gold like this page.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that a scent of sysadmin I smell?</br>  <br><br>Anything by tksn.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/645969/c16210<wbr>0ff0/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>why do you read stuff like that?</br>  <br>Why does anyone do anything?</br>  <br>I'm curious, what allows you to get off to the sight of unloading logs into someones mouth?</br>  <br> Mfw she told that one lady who can help them about what they were doing to her and the other girls only to have her have another hallucination and having the rapist playing it off a her being mad at them, and the lady believed the rapist, then the girl gets raped some more.  There is no hope for them is there.</br>  <br>but it doesn't sound like fun at all</br>  <br>God that page always cracked me the fuck up.<br>I love Kawady.<br><br><br>It's fine I'm used to it.<br><br>Nyet.<br><br>It's not always unloading into someone's mouth. But I do like that too, if it's both girls.<br>It doesn't start that bad. It started just liking seeing girls shove out a solid log. Like a reverse anal dildo or something. Then it progressed from there. <br>It's hard to describe. It's weirdly intimate, I guess. Putting something that was in someone else into them. I only like that when both partners are into it, not forced.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/, what is the most disturbing thing you've ever read/seen in a hentai? <br>I've read and whacked off to far more disturbing stuff, but "Holes" definitely made me feel the most disgusted after blowing my load.<br><br>I think that hentai was the one that made me cross the moral event horizon.</br></br></br></br>  Uhh, Volunteer Breeding.<br>Actually wasn't disturbing at all, but when I reached the end and realized I fapped to it, and it didn't even have sex, it hit me how far gone I went. That was a long time ago though.<br><br>Otherwise, if you mean the most fucked up thing I've read, probably one of those things by Oyster. I mean, it doesn't really affect me, but they are definitely the most fucked up I've read. I guess the Junko one is bad too, but I went into it knowing it was a true story and still fapped anyway, so I can't particularly comment.<br><br>Ahh, if you're curious about doujins based on true stories, read The Magical Girl Next Door. It's based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvi<wbr>a_Likens.<br>It uses Madoka characters though, so it either makes you feel less, or feel worse, depending on how autistic you are, I suppose.<br><br><br>Most of the time St. Margareta just feels silly. Especially the animal kindergarten ones. I can't feel bad 99% of the time.<br>Black Files was pretty messed up, but damn does he make torturing her look fun as fuck. I wish I was those twins. Also Manchella's body can miraculously take literally any punishment, and she'll be fine two pages later anyway.<br>I really hope there's a new one soon. Especially since translations have been pouring in lately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I really hope there's a new one soon. Especially since translations have been pouring in lately. <br> tfw when the ones I really like are only translated in Thai <br>Fuck the Thai</br></br></br>  <br>This could get some uses.</br>  <br>It's gotten to the point that i look for this stuff just to laugh at it.<br><br>Meh, i can't get past the disgust of what it is to get arroused by it, although you reminded me of a log pushing contest in a manga i saw once, thanks for that.</br></br></br>  What the fuck. How do people like all this shit?  <br>Saved for future use</br>  <br>Sadism?</br>  Standard guro stuff honestly feel pretty tame compared to the more realistic stories. Geiger Counter hit me a lot harder than any amount of girls being chopped up.  <br><br>Oh my god, Is there a happy ending to this mess?</br></br>  <br>I tried to read the "Baby fuck, baby fuck it's awwwright!" manga, and on like the 2nd page there was a splash image of a girl who had tights and garter belts made out of the lack of her skin. I nope'd right the fuck out.</br>  <br> what the fuck <br>Lurk moar these people are fucking nothing compared to the real sickos out there.</br></br>  <br>It has a sequel<br><br>here are the links, couldn't find any ex links<br>1- http://nhentai.net/g/113101/<br>2- http://nhentai.net/g/121926/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But god damn, most of this stuff just takes it way too far.</br>  <br>Somewhere in the world, there lives a man who is in love with a rock, and he fucks this rock every single night,  the laws of probability are a bitch like that. </br>  <br>I mean I know it's fictional, but I just find it so weird that people derive sexual pleasure from all this.</br>  <br>That could make a good 4chan banner if it could be made.</br>  <br>If you didn't at least get a boner while reading this, you don't belong here.</br>  <br>But anon<br>http://exhentai.org/g/722925/a0c310<wbr>c12a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/763259/ad56d4<wbr>2040/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Waita Uziga's art isn't that good  besides I prefer the story with the serial killer murdering preggos </br>  <br> he hasn't seen the normie posts <br>No you fucking sicko you need treatment for your sick minded shit.<br><br> its funny to see the first time reactions to Junko, she needs more exposure so everyone can understand her struggle. </br></br></br></br>    <br>I can't for the life of me find black file(s) 1.<br>No chance you got a copy?</br></br>  <br>I always thought of Girl in Concrete as the age old "rite of passage" for 4chan.</br>  <br>You know it's going to be bad when the brutally violent rape only takes two pages. Then we move on to the real shit.</br>  <br>Go play starless or go through the cgset<br>It made me understand why someone would like scat, but I still personally don't enjoy it.<br><br><br>StrawberryShortcakeshittingoutstraw<wbr>berryfrosting.jpg<br>You know you're gay if you would want a cute girl to do that into your mouth.</br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think scat has to do with degradation and dominance, rather than actually liking shit.</br>  <br>Got it, putting on sadpanda. Just a minute.</br>  <br>That's what Starless was mostly about and it was hot as fuck. Made by the same dude who did Bible Black.<br>There's a scat-free version/option.</br></br>  <br>How new you supposed to be for making threads this shit?</br>  <br>Well for me, sometimes I laugh at how ridiculous I think the content is. Maybe it's the same for some people, though instead of stimulating their sense of humor it stimulates sexual excitement. Brains are weird and I'm not going to pretend I know how it all works, and coming across a something that was intended for a certain audience to react in a certain way that's foreign to my way of thinking gets a more inquisitive response out of me. I'm past the "What the fuck this is weird. I don't understand these deviants!", and I think anyone that is not simply isn't mature enough to understand that people think differently and that opinions exist, a fundamental concept. That kind of emotional disbelief shows a almost sheltered lack of observational experience. Not implying you have to accept the actual content, just acknowledge that the content exists without being over-dramatic about it.</br>  <br>I'm laughing but I don't know why.</br>  <br> i am le oldfag </br>  <br>The absolute best. When are we going to get something new from him?</br>  <br>It is, though as time goes on, it seems less and less a place where you become desensitized to the horrors of the internet.</br>    <br>Not nearly as bad. I've fapped to that and enjoyed it.<br><br>Concrete Girl just made me feel like a horrible human being the entire time. <br><br>Same with the one where Kirino spirals down into being a druggie and a pornstar, even if I did hate the horrible bitch in the show. This one.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/387824/5d4c58<wbr>6a31/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>inu shoujo</br>  <br>oh god not again<br>I thought I scrubbed my memory of that nonsense</br></br>  <br>That may have been the case a while ago but things change and so does the times. Not everyone is up to scratch when it comes this.</br>  <br>Nooooooo</br>  <br>Oh my god that shit is hilarious.</br>  <br/>    <br> Suicide School <br>Can't find anything with this name, although I did find something else from this thread I wanted.<br>Anyway, suicide school?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still in a dream...</br>  <br>milk party?</br>  <br>She's probably lactose intolerant.</br>  <br>This. p-please?<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/829395/e4e065<wbr>ab72/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>THOSE FUCKING MONSTERS</br>  <br>This is a guy isn't it?</br>  elves rapists  After all this horrible rape I really need the one where the loli goes,<br>"Please God, please kill all these people..."<br> "OKAY" </br></br>  I remember the thread like it was yesterday, MODS were so cool back then, I bet now they will 404 the thread before it even start.  <br><br><br>That's the one where they physically mutilate the girls. Stuff like the eye getting removed, nipples being cut off, etc?<br><br>And that at one point a new girl is delivered and a prisoner freaks the fuck out and starts to fight the other guys and the guards to protect her. Because she's only an orphan because her fathers in jail.
