[ Let's have a thread From The New World, ok?  What is "From The New World"?  <br>Have you heard of "google"?</br>  <br>The best anime ever</br>  Beginning was good, middle was a clusterfuck, some good atmospheric moments in the middle but the winter was boring as fuck. Ending was pretty good.<br>Good and interesting worldbuilding and I somewhat wished that we got to know more of the history rather than some brief flashbacks of the past.<br><br>Main cast was boring as fuck though.<br>Manga is sexual as fuck thanks to a doujin artist doing the art.<br><br>Squealer did nothing wrong but he should have not gone after the kids with his only trump card.<br>And that's all I have to say about that anime that needs to be said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good world. Loved the ambiance. Quite unique, so more memorable than most "decent" shows in the last few years.</br>  Risa Taneda's singing and girly girly voice makes my dick feel funny.  So this is a thread From The New World...  GREAT<br>ENDING</br>  Great atmosphere and really interesting. Probably in the top 5 of the last few years.  <br> Squealer did nothing wrong <br>he killed best girl</br></br>  Certainly one of the most depressing shows I've seen.  Ending is Lord of the Rings in Japan, except with anthrax.  <br>yeah i don't think i will ever want to rewatch it cause of this</br>  <br> From The New World <br>kek</br></br>  Does the pacing of this show pick up?<br>I have picked it up a few times, but I always get bored with how slow it is and end up dropping it.</br>  <br>Yeah, it was sad what they did to the rat people.</br>  <br>It gets a bit better when they are adults.</br>   Take responsibility, will ya?   God I want to fuck him so hard.   This is a boy's hip   They are more like Coward Attack Force.<br><br>Enemy has no guns, only swords. Still they attack with mortars and cannons.<br><br>They have no honor at all.</br></br></br></br>    Honor is having 10000 men and woman fight with equal weapons against an army of 300000 <br><br>I'll take life and total victory over your dead corpse that is Honor</br></br>  <br>21 foot rule</br>  <br>Koreans </br>  Fuck off  <br>Shitty army brought on themselves, there was even a warning sign.</br>  <br>More like Coward Attack notRomans.<br>Enemy has no weapons at all, only civilians. Still they attack with dragons and swords.<br>They have no honor at all.</br></br></br>  <br>A bunch of magic niggers are running at you with swords and shit and you think you can match them. Whatever you say cold steel you can run in and we'll watch.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much this. Besides, the only reason the notromans attacked was because they though that the average civilian was a representation of the combat power of the world they were invading.</br></br>  <br>Honor died the moment guns are invented</br>  <br><br>Are you talking about the founding of America?</br></br>    Best MC.  whyd they make itami a 2nd lt when he was a 1st lt in the manga?   CGI Dragon <br> CGI Horses <br> CGI Vehicles <br> Most chicks look worse than in the manga <br><br>I think I'll stick to the manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  <br> worse <br>lol</br></br>  <br>shitty third world logic you got there m8</br>  So are they gonna make the cqc girl part of Itami's harem or something?  <br>She doesn't like Itami one bit.</br>  <br>I had a huge smile on my face for that entire scene</br>  <br>In the manga maybe, but I'm getting some serious tsun vibes from her in the cartoon. I'm just waiting for the dere.</br>  <br>So damn goood</br>   Japanese soldiers slaughter men by the thousands without even trying a peaceful resolution <br>Well, atleast its accurate in that regard.</br>  Donald Trump? Is this a prophecy?  <br>Too much hair to be Donald Trump.</br>  <br>He upgraded his toupee after getting elected.</br>  <br>Go away, Saber.</br>  <br>It's more america than anything.</br>  <br>They're just learning from big brother America.</br>  <br>She doesn't respect him because of his otaku-ish demeanor. <br>She'll lighten up towards him sooner or later.<br>Not going to be in the harem though.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't learn anything from America.<br><br>Traditional invading state military? Blow everything the fuck up. Everything. If there's still things after you didn't do it right.<br><br>Terrorists? Can't blow anything up because that would make people made so just capture them and utilize the Geneva Convention loophole about non-state military enemy combatants not qualifying as prisoners of war to torture them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This whole episode has to be the biggest REKT I have seen in my life. 10/10</br>   people in the other world speak Japanese <br>what?</br>  Do MRLs show up at any point?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FzU<wbr>b8A3qrbM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>it's that glorious nippon tongue<br><br>english for gaijins and dirty waito piggus</br></br></br>  <br> そうか at the end </br>  <br><br> Honor <br> Roman armies emperor exploits espre de corpse to weaken his allies <br> Scorches earth on surrounding innocent villages etc to stymie "the enemy" <br> Implying any of this is done by someone honorable <br><br> Roman army slaughters civilians <br> Not expecting to get your shit slapped into fucking orbit. <br><br>What they need to do is launch a thor's hammer into orbit and pitch a kinetic kill vehicle at the imperial capitol.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br> people in the other world speak English <br>what?</br></br>  <br> the jews fear the samurai <br><br>No they fucking don't. Not with the might of every Western government and military in the world.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127906870 <br>Judging by how often I see it on /a/, /v/, /k/,etc there are plenty of weebs in the army.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127906870 <br>Every thread.</br>  <br><br>fuck off juden scum</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't be surprising to anyone. Where else is a NEET with no skills or money going good to go when their parents kick them out of the basement?</br>  <br>Anyone have the vid of some soldier having his superiors come into his room and see all his weeb shit?</br>   Pick the manga back up after a year of not reading it <br><br>Now I remember why I stopped caring about it.<br><br>Premise is nice in the beginning but it just gets meh later on.<br><br>The LN is over right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's that glorious english tongue<br><br>nippon is for small dicked chinks</br></br></br>  <br>AMERICA GOT IT'S ASS KICKED IT'S NOT MEH<br><br>CRY MORE FATTY</br></br></br>  I can't wait for this part  <br>I don't even give a fuck about that.<br><br>The premise entirely is meh as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> guys maybe we should get rid of our superior weaponry just so we can have the honor of fighting on par <br> yeah! lets not try to reduce the casualties of our friends as much as possible so we can uphold this retarded ideal <br> why don't we just not try even winning at all? lets just get fucking invaded! <br><br>Fuck off back to cnn you fucking liberal</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> AMERICA GOT IT'S ASS KICKED IT'S NOT MEH <br><br>Wait, what? what happened?</br></br></br>  <br>lol nigger</br>  <br>NOT GIVING A FUCK DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT<br>MURICA GOT ITS ASS KICKED<br><br>CRY MORE BURGER</br></br></br></br>  <br> Premise is nice in the beginning but it just gets meh later on <br> The premise entirely is meh as fuck. <br>the premise is somewhat unique in today's anime what the fuck are you talking about</br></br></br>  I just want to see earth kill people.  you guys know damn well that if america went through the gate they'd be firing canister shot out of abrams and dropping bomblets and napalm from jets.  <br>And there is nothing wrong with that.</br>  <br>This.</br>  Not sure if ass devastated murricans, or just plain trolls  <br>Like, seeing those mortars rip open horsemen and foot soldiers was satisfyng as fuck. Knowing full well they started it.</br>  <br> She'll lighten up towards him sooner or later. <br><br>She does? I've only read the manga and other than her  being angry at him for letting them behind to kill the dragon, I can't see it. And now Itami is parting ways with his squad. </br></br></br>  <br>MARSOC more like MORESUCK<br><br><br><br>Gotta admit I had a full /k/ boner after that, can't wait to watch dragon get his shit packed in next ep</br></br></br></br></br>   Fantasy novels about contemporary Japanese military winning wars against medieval army. <br><br>Is this the best Japan can do?</br></br>  <br>Wtf are you on about?</br>   Watching japanese army propaganda.   <br>JSDF kinda did that this episode using air burst artillery rounds to deal with the army in the beginning then once they were in range got fucking REKT even more by the tanks and machine gun positions</br>  <br>His actions in Italica and his ranger cred made her more amiable to him. He also didn't let a single squad member die.<br>She still doesn't like his otaku hobby but she's got more respect for him now than before.<br>Right now all she knows about Itami is that he's the hero of Ginza but never seen him in action, just that of a lazy otaku bum.</br></br></br>  Why is this such a one sided massacre with the Self-Defense force having a overwhelming lead?  <br>Nanomachines, son.</br>  <br> Why is this such a one sided massacre with the Self-Defense force having a overwhelming lead? <br><br>You pretty much answered your own question.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Honor in a battlefield. </br>  ALL EVIL ENEMIES WILL FALL BEFORE THE RIGHTEOUS NIPPON SELF DEFENSE FORCE HERE TO LIBERATE THE PEOPLE FROM THE OPPRESSION OF THE WEST I mean FROM THE EVIL KING<br><br>BANZAI BANZAI BANZAI<br><br> Seriously, is this shit funded by the JSDF? </br></br></br></br>  <br>The author is a military fanatic but you're reaching too much.</br>  <br><br> waaaah it's not murica propaganda <br> hurr it's shit <br><br>Mad burger detected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Giving a fuck if something is propaganda or not. </br>  <br><br>Why are you screaming faggot? Also every murican movie is the same murica = good, the others = evil shit. <br>Stop crying because a chinese cartoon doesn't glorify your country faggot, let nippon have their fun you autist.</br></br></br>  <br>all these flavors and you chose to be salty</br>   ITT: mad burgers   japan lost its honor after ww2  <br><br><br><br>It's good that the kiddo scum uses terms such as 'meh'. That way you can identify them easier and disregard their shitty opinions without the need to go through their whole post.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> ... <br> LOL <br> ! <br><br>Fucking OP you are full of cancer, I hate summer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> fantasy novel <br>Huh, anon, what's wrong with that. You know this is just fantasy, right?<br><br>Btw, so tired of hearing bait like you</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying they ever had it <br>ADMIT TO THE FUCKING WAR CRIMES ALREADY,JAPAN! You aren't fooling anybody. Also, Fuck your Samurai, they weren't honor bound wanderers they were thugs and killers who worked for whoever was paying.</br></br>  <br>They also 1v3 russia,america, and china special forces.</br>  <br>Did it really have it then.<br>The only reason they got industrialized was due to perry forcing them open their ports.</br></br>  <br>Oh, anon, stop. That's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard nips do sense some samurai nigga won world war 2 with his magic Katana.</br>  <br><br>The one who killed the special forces  was the immortal semi-goddess, not the Japanese. </br></br>  <br> They also 1v3 russia,america, and china special forces. <br>You mean they fought America, backed out when they realized it was them, and watched the ensuing bloodbath with the 3 countries and Rory?<br><br>Because that's what happened you burger.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean the Airforce one?<br>https://<span>youtu.be/RrSS058pjWw  [ ]<br><br> Air force ain't even the worst with it. The navy and the marines are. </br></br></br></br>  <br> gigantic army consisting of people who fucking invaded your world/country a little bit ago marching towards you <br> peaceful resolution <br>Please tell me you're just trying to be stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Korean detected</br>  <br> mfw you're american and your ancestors slaughtered gunless red indians </br>  It was surprisingly fresh to see guns win when fantasy is involved, and seeing the magical enemy GBTFO.  <br>But Japan doesn't have an army.</br>  <br>Later in the series, US, Russia and I think China all make attempts to abduct the MC's fantasy world waifus in order to have talks with them and make deals. The special forces from the three countries are all defeated handily, and it's a big embarrassment for the three world powers.<br><br>US goes back to submissively providing Japan with money and equipment, on the hopes of one day being allowed access to the other world's resources.</br></br></br>  Wow kids, look at how much fun war is! Notice the might and power of the JSDF! Don't you realize now how stupid article 9 is? Let's just get rid of that pesky thing.  <br>Two nukes weren't enough.</br>  <br>You say that like it's a bad thing.</br>  <br>If you go to nip boards you will see this show have opposite effect of that.</br>  <br>The original plan called for over 20 had Japan not surrendered</br>  <br>USA USA USA USA!</br>  <br>The best part is that no nukes were necessary as the threat of the imminent red army invasion was far scarier than anything the allies possessed.</br>  The best thing about this anime is watching it with /a/. Just like every other shit anime. KLK and A/Z were shit, but /a/ made them fun.  I remember reading comments from the real JSDF serviceman criticizing how the author portrayed the JSDF in a "bad" way.<br><br>From wiping our thousands of soldiers to pathetic otaku protagonist, they just hated author's ideas.</br></br>  <br>I remember bullshit</br>  <br>It's confirmed hoax.</br>  <br>lol even feudal samurai lords knew it was better to attack with outrageous advantages.</br>  <br> The special forces from the three countries are all defeated handily <br> defeated handily </br></br>  <br>The enemy has fucking dragons. What do you want?</br>  <br>In their defense they fought agaist an immortal to firearms demigod in bloodlust</br>  <br>Cruise Missles would make short work of dragons. They crush reinforced steel and titanium, they'll slaughter dragons.<br><br>Seriously, people dont even know how fucking advanced modern weapons are.<br><br>I'm not even thinking NEXT GEN SPECIAL FORCES shit, just stuff used right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japan only fought against America. Rory fought everyone.</br>  <br> Enemy has no guns, only swords. Still they attack with mortars and cannons. <br><br>Remind me somone in the M.E</br></br></br>  <br>Japan didn't even knew it was US black ops untill they seen the nigga corpse</br>  <br>Reminder that japanese honor was only about following orders from your superiors. Which they did. Beyond that everything goes.</br>  <br>Easily defeated with an AA12 using explosive rounds.<br><br>Seriously, if you think about it, Most Fantasy Shit&lt;Modern Warfare.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and after that they backed out.<br><br>Japan beating all three countries was nonsense.</br></br></br>  <br>only crippled untill regenration kicks in, only another God can kill Rory for real</br>  <br>Japanese Bushido is shit tier.<br>"FOLLOW ORDERS AT ALL COSTS" is shit tier honor.<br><br>If your Lord says "Slaughter the peasants, I want a new peasant skin coat.", you should NEVER follow that order.<br><br>"Yes, my Samurai, bring me the penises of every man you slay. I wish a penis necklace as well."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep shooting, then take remains and dump into a vat of acid before regen kicks in.<br><br>She endless regenerates, but the acid endlessly burns.<br><br>You win.<br>Huzzah for SCIENCE!<br>Fuck that magic shit.<br>That's also how you kill Deadpool, by the way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I lol so hard from this pic. <br>I can not think of a better way to spend the extra time before the operation especially when your current gear suit perfectly for this other task.</br></br>  I'M NUUUUCLEAAAAAR  <br>Look at this ahegao slut</br>  <br>Deadpool cannot die. His soul can't be parted. He'd eventually regenerate faster than the acid could deteriorate him.</br>  <br> but the acid endlessly burns <br>Well, no, that's not really how that works...</br></br>   First episode ends on a cliff hanger of the army about to fight a huge army <br> second episode starts <br> Army already defeated <br><br>Seriously? The one interesting premise of the show and they keep skimping on it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that the Emperor actually wanted all those soldiers killed off.</br>  <br>That's what King David did, and God approved. Reminder that Christians are following kike orders.</br>  <br> Only one guy left <br> Let's not even arrest him for Intel or leverage </br></br>  <br>Imperial Army engagement isn't in the source material too.<br>Only the fight between the unified kingdoms army leaded by Duran and the JSDF was showed</br></br>  <br> Seriously? The one interesting premise of the show and they keep skimping on it. <br><br>They did the same for the manga too. the Army they did show battle is the one you are seeing in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br> He survived and become an ally of japan </br>  <br>The manga is not the source material</br>  <br>Holy shit Big Boss survived</br>  I started off liking how they're filling in the story earlier than in the manga, but two episodes to introduce Tuka and the rest was pushing it a little.  <br>The JSDF already told them that it's a bad idea, but they went through with it anyway. The special forces got the demigoddess angry and got rekt.</br>  <br>i think it wasn't either in the true original source material of WN</br>  <br>Yeah, but he's in the wrong universe.</br>  <br>It was in the novel at least which is the new canon of the series</br>  <br>yes and it's going to have fun with his new friends</br>  <br>What happens if Rory is separated into 2 and both parts are locked up in different places, Will there be 2 Rory's or 1 slowly dying Rory?</br>  <br>one of the two parts will disintegrate and Rory will fully regenerate from the other</br>  <br>Why wouldnt they use all their advantages to win? Do you even into war, anon?</br>  <br> treating mass murderers that massacre and enslave civilians without second thought with honor <br>Are you just pretending to be retarded?</br></br>  <br>Instead of using the dragon to attack defenceless villages, why didn't they use it to attack the army instead? <br><br>Army would have had a hard time since they said they had enough trouble penetrating the armour on the small ones as it is.</br></br></br>  <br>because the Flame Dragon isn't an Empire pet</br>  <br>The dragon isn't part of the empire</br>  <br> using the dragon <br>They can't.</br></br>  Shouldn't they try capturing shit alive for studying?  <br>That dragon is an Acient Dragon, something almost godlike like Rory but not immortal.<br> Army would have had a hard time since they said they had enough trouble penetrating the armour on the small ones as it is. <br>Anti-tank weapons can injured it but killing that thing require way more firepower<br><br>they have 6000 prisoner in japan and the local support from villages around Alnus hill</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes because they so had intel about trying to infilitrate and extract in secrecy. AA12 with he rounds is so subtle.</br>  <br> She endless regenerates, but the acid endlessly burns. <br>That's not how it works. <br>Acid gets saturated with shit you dissolve in it.</br></br></br>  <br>Should have sent in JTF2.</br>  I'd start worshiping Hardy and ask him to turn me into an immortal loli with a Spear in return I'd marry him.<br><br>Also how come none of the gods take notice of hummies.</br></br>  <br> not just getting an A-10 and watch how it rapes the dragons ass </br>    <br>Good luck hitting the dragon with some cruise missiles. <br><br>now Phalanx systems Now that would be entertaining. even if the bullets can pierce its hide, it'd still be like spraying a high powered hose at the dragon.<br><br>But the best anti dragon weapon would probably be an 30mm or 37mm autocannon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The GAU-8 could be ineffective agaist Acient Dragon scale armor </br>  <br>nice try shlomo</br>  <br> Also how come none of the gods take notice of hummies. <br>They do they just don't give a shit.<br>It's why Yao changed beliefs.</br></br></br>  I hope this doesn't turn into harem shit, it's been pretty cool watching the military completely reking the magical puffs up. And besides, they attacked first  <br> not worshiping Rory the Goddess of Love </br>   driving along talking about dumb shit and singing animu songs <br><br>I think this is actually realistic soldiering behavior</br></br>  <br>Itami build himself a pretty nice harem featuring a demigod, 2 elves, a Yuki Nagato sorceress and later the emperor daughter.</br>  This show is dumb.  <br>Welcome to anime newfriend.</br>  <br> Hardy <br> him </br></br>  <br>But his name</br>  <br>doesn't matter, it's confirmed dyke lusting for Rory</br>  <br>Oh shit son</br>  <br>Rory doesn't like her though</br>  <br> There's a hardy in here too <br><br>Well shit, how did I miss such a simple thing.</br></br></br>  <br>you missed a lot</br>  <br>The plan was for an invasion had the two nukes failed since that's all we had prepared at the moment. Plus if 2 didn't work we weren't expecting 20 to pull it off without an invasion. I really don't know where u got the 20 nukes belief but if you got a source I would love to read it. <br><br><br>I have no idea why any one ever says or believes this. Russians would have taken Korea and than stopped until a US invasion got the ball rolling. On another note Russia invading Japan would have been a mess for the US as well. It would be another Berlin wall except in Asia.</br></br></br></br>  <br> SpecOps guys show up at the bathhouse completely undetected <br> Politely wait outside the women's changing room <br> "Sorry ladies but we need you to come with us eh, we'd really rather make this quick and painless so we don't have to hurt any hosers on the way back out either." </br></br></br>  <br>  It would be another Berlin wall except in Asia. <br> Japan spit in half, north vs south <br> extensive research into quantum physics and parallel worlds for military application begins <br>This is just like my animes.</br></br></br></br>  Americans: RESOURCES!<br>Japan: Lets investigate their culture and politics (after killing 120,000 people)<br><br>They supposedly sent in some scouts before, but their first major move is to just roll in with tanks and men and get into a fight with a much inferior force? Wouldn't they send in drones and have all sorts of recon on the (potential) enemy first? I'd imagine the world would spend years investigating before even making a move. Also, I'm sure they would definitely know how the gate works before making a major move.<br><br>I mean how do you go "lets see what this place is like" AFTER you just walk in and decimate over 100,000 Roman-empire age people? Yeah I get rolling in and kicking *** after being attacked, but don't pull the pacifist card after that "JAPAN **** yeah!" display and then also toss a jab at the USA at the same time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'd imagine the world would spend years investigating before even making a move. Also, I'm sure they would definitely know how the gate works before making a major move. <br>Not really, not after the civilian massacre.<br>Remember, it's politicians who call the shots and it's BAD when your voters get chopped into pieces and raped by orcs and you respond with 'let's slowly and carefully poke around and see what happens'.<br>After they crushed big army they can do the poking just fine and the enemy is aware they're not easy prey.</br></br></br></br>  Why don't they just launch a satellite?  <br>Nah, just shoot her until there's barely anything left, then lock her up. Or like, put the remains in a barrel, fill the barrel with cement and then lock it up somewhere, like, a radioactive waste containment site. I'm sure that'll be secure. I mean, what's the probability of a MUTO releasing her?  The probability is 100% </br>  <br><br>Don't expect too much from JSDF banzai: the anime, it's an okay entertainment when not thinking deeply about "realism(kek)" in the series.</br></br>  <br> Why don't they just launch a satellite? <br>Through the gate?</br></br>  <br>Plus you're fighting on their land instead of holding them off in the middle of a city.</br>  <br>Getting shit into space takes a bit more effort than sticking a gps satellite onto a truck, driving it through the gate and catapulting it into the air nigga.</br>  <br>It's time consuming, expensive and you need a lot of science first so your ¥ don't drift into alien space or get eaten by magical space monsters.</br>  <br> Don't expect too much from JSDF banzai: the anime, <br>I read the manga. Just explaining why this would happen similarly IRL when large casualties are involved.</br></br>  <br>These things work fine for intercontinental flights.<br><br>How much more fuel would you need to get shit into a stable orbit?</br></br></br>  <br> indians <br> gunless <br><br>You need to read a bit more, mate</br></br></br></br>  Am I the only one who just sees this as some butthurt Jap fantasizing about glorious nippon defeating the westerners and taking their women like they should have 70 years ago?<br><br>I mean, why ancient Rome and elves and that instead of like Feudal Japan with Oni and bean demons or whatever?</br></br>  <br><br>Explain further please.</br></br>  <br>For GPS you'd need 2 or 3.</br>  <br> How much more fuel would you need to get shit into a stable orbit? <br>Not much. I read somewhere you mostly need to do adjustment to flight path because the missiles are able to get to orbit / reach orbit velocity.<br>Compared to 'proper' rockets build to carry stuff up they won't be able to carry as much payload though.<br>Also  but with much more satellites if you want good coverage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>3 or more actually, I think modern receivers use 5 signals<br><br>But a spy satellite would be better for scouting</br></br></br>  <br> I mean, why ancient Rome and elves and that instead of like Feudal Japan with Oni and bean demons or whatever? <br>It already exists, can't be bothered to find manga, here's live action instead.</br></br>  <br> Oh god, he's a fucking Missilier. /a/ has access to nukes <br><br>whoa</br></br></br>  <br>So Rory can be weakened enough through doing enough damage to her than her regeneration can keep up. In that time she would be vulnerable to being raped, yes?</br>  <br> raped while weakened enough through doing enough damage to her than her regeneration can keep up <br>You know, you can just go buy a few pounds of bloody meat from your nearest butcher and fuck that.</br></br>  <br>Then there's the matter of the math. Like the gravity of the GATE world and other factors. If the gravity feels the same, but is in fact a little bit different, or what is the size of the planet or its moon(s), it kinda all adds up.</br>  <br> happy merchant </br>  Anime viewer only... So far this series bothers me by what appears to be a lack of understanding of military history and military tactics history. I am unable to understand the thinking of an military leader that would attack an entry to what they understand as another world without having made significant recon excursions to gauge their opponents military capabilities. Secondly, why would any field commander continue to pursue the same tactics in the aftermath of such an overwhelming defeat. I am left with the strong impression that the writers of this series made little to no effort in research and are just making things up so as to promote some jingo-istic point of view. The rest is hand-waving through a poorly constructed narrative just to satisfy some simplistic nationalist point of view.<br><br>Don't know that I will be watching any further. Please, enjoy your show.</br></br>   It's okay when America does it.   <br> I am unable to understand the thinking of an military leader that would attack an entry to what they understand as another world without having made significant recon excursions to gauge their opponents military capabilities. <br>Plug the hole first, gauge later. You don't want 50K orcs to start a party again in the middle of capital city, do you?</br></br>  <br> It's really hilarious how americunts get buttmad about a JAPANESE author writing a JAPANESE novel about Japan killing NotRomans when they release shitty "muh America might" movies with setting as unlikely as a portal to a magical world opening in the midle of a city every fucking year.</br>  <br>Who are you talking about? The Japanese or the NotRomans?<br><br>Also, thanks. I AM enjoying GATE. Especially the second episode.</br></br></br>   complaining that military murder people even though it's their job <br>kek</br>   Episode 1: Nothing happens, the disappointment <br> Episode 2: Nothing happens again, the electric disappointment boogaloo <br><br>I'm going to fall asleep before they fight the dragon.</br></br></br>  <br><br> but it's only logical america wins because america has the best military in the world <br> japan doesn't even have a military <br> our wanking is based on logic japan's is not <br> that makes it more correct </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, to be fair, American/Western stories with this setting tend to tackle it from the opposite direction.<br><br>Space faring aliens who've ravaged multiple worlds like ID4 aliens, Transformers and even Stargate aliens tend to lose to the technologically inferior Americans (though admittedly, America has Bill Pullman). GATE is essentially telling it from the "aliens" point of view, wherein they really should be curbstomping the non-dimension warping primitives.</br></br></br>  <br>How about not making shit up and tell us what actually happened, buttblasted yank.</br>  <br>I don't really think it's that hand wavy. I just think the warriors were full of themselves and the based on how well they dealt with the previous attack in Tokyo, I think the JDF had a good idea that they weren't dealing with anything they couldn't handle with GUNS.<br>And yes, I will definitely be enjoying this show.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Fantasy novels about contemporary Japanese military bringing democracy and civilization into barbaric lands <br>FTFY.<br>Sounds better this way, doesn't it?</br></br></br>  All these murrifats tears are delicious. I really enjoy gate treads.  <br>It was like five people from each nation involved minus Japan. They may have been tripping over each others spying I forget if so, and the JSDF killed a few soldiers attempting to capture the people from the other world.<br><br>No, the stupid part was when they ran through a crowd of civilians and said to shoot anyone who gets too close. That was fucking stupid.</br></br></br>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome,<wbr>_Sweet_Rome</wbr>  <br>There are hundreds of variables they would need to establish before they could produce working equations that would successfully get a satellite into orbit.</br>  <br>Mandatory<br> Reddit </br></br>  <br><br>Since ages ago 4chan is an extension of reddit just look at the mods.</br></br>  <br>you need explosives to do more damage than she can heal in a fight.<br>USA, Russia and China black ops couldn't slowed down her with only guns</br></br>  All these anons mad with Japan self waking. I can't wait until we get pic related.  So the Japanese are interested in the wealth of resources in the other world, but disregarded a valuable commodity like dragon scales?  <br>wyvern scales are shit.<br>Real dragon scales aren't something you can get without RPGs,tanks,SPGs, helos and fighters everytime you want few dozens of them</br></br>  <br>Then why were Lelei and the rest convinced they were "filthy rich", just from scavenging the nearby corpses?</br>  <br><br> He doesn't enjoy watching primitives get raped by modern technology </br></br>  <br> tfw modern day primitives are quite good with weapons, like in the Islamic Sandnigger State </br>  <br>I didn't said dragon scales, not wyvern, aren't valuable.<br>But dragons are rare, extremly hard to kill and the JSDF don't have the resoruces to waste in dragons hunting, they are satisfied with the samples they looted from that single dragon for scientific purpose</br></br>  <br> wyvern scales have no value in our world <br>You realize they want real resources not fantasy shit that has no real use.<br>Also the scales are valuable because they're rare.<br>If army started wyvern genocide and flooded the market price would drop to nothing in a hearbeat. That's basic enconomy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>is just a standard western character from an anime. Big nose, blonde hair</br>  <br>What the fuck are they going to do with dragon scales?</br>  <br>scales --&gt; local currency --&gt; gold, silver, copper --(transport back to Japan)--&gt; yen <br><br>As an anon said above, it would mess with the economy, but we shouldn't accuse modern governments of economic wisdom.</br></br></br>  <br> What the fuck are they going to do with dragon scales? <br>Yeah, technically it is a useful raw material for the locals, but for an industrial modern nation the scales are not economical to harvest. And the material could probably be synthetically replicated in a lab if they need to, so it is not relevant to try and hoard dragon scales.</br></br>  <br>Nations wage war for strategic resources, not pocket change.</br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jRgu<wbr>7aHdgXg</wbr>  [ ]  <br>That's dumb, the average ordinary Roman citizen wasn't kitted out like a legionary so why would they assume the Japanese civilians are soldiers?</br>  Anyone else just skip over the normal-side geopolitics (Japan, USA, China, etc.) altogether? It's just too silly.  <br>For much of Rome's history the soldiers were a citizen milita.<br>Only towards the end of the republic's life did soldering become a profession.</br></br>  What does 2ch and futaba think of the JSDF dick waving and questionable interpretation of Article 9?  <br>Japan did some test on dragon scales looted from the dragon fought by Itami teams: they are low density, lightweight, extreme hard organic material (between 9-10 on Mohs scale).<br>They can be usefull for a lot of shit but the fact they are also extremly rare makes any scale owner rich</br></br>  <br>No. Because it's large source of butthurt (read amusement) when demigod slaughters special forces of some random word power.</br>  <br> republic <br>This is clearly Imperial Rome</br></br>  <br>Probably not an actually valuable resource when you think about it on a national's budget level.<br><br>And I bet once you'd start exploiting resources, the EU, USA, Russia, China will immediately loose their patience. (Odd that they haven't yet, but hey, its a JSDF war porn manga of sorts, so ... uh, I guess they needed to stay out).</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully it gets them going full Nationalism. Article 9 needs to be fucking thrown out, Japan has to stop being cucked.</br>  <br>Nah man, the other people in the room arent blonde and blue eyed and we've only had like three or four blonde presidents so there musr be some special meaning.</br>  <br>Well, yes. People above are making perfectly valid points.</br>  <br>The fact that they are extremely rare makes them strategically worthless though unless they can be artificially replicated.<br>A luxury resource at best.</br></br>  You can die for fairness?<br>If so, it's wonderful. <br>But I can't. Sorry.</br></br>  <br> but we shouldn't accuse modern governments of economic wisdom. <br>They have that.

That soldiers put their lives on the line and doing any large scale maneuver in the arctic can put lives in danger? Why do you think the Germans lost in the first place? Because their soldiers started freezing to death in the Russian winter.<br><br>Your actual point is "I'm going to blame America all the time because I'm from some other shitheap"</br></br></br>  <br>I will kill you if you badmouth my waifu.</br>  <br>Sure, they're not doing too bad at all in terms of getting out of abject poverty, for instance. Which is difficult, as many failed states show.<br><br>But the point was more that the depiction of Chinese and US motivations is retarded. And just kinda forced in there, too.<br><br>They don't really do fuck all for the story, you just get to see some Chjinese and US agents getting massacred.<br><br><br>Some of these might still need an apology.<br><br>But it's not like Japan is particularly entitled to wait until everyone else apologized, or not excessively prideful in not apologizing when it also clearly hurts current relations and the war crimes are pretty much an undeniable fact anyways.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because their soldiers started freezing to death in the Russian winter. <br><br>God I am fucking sick of this. Sure the cold was a huge problem and killed a bunch of troops. <br><br>But, the real problem was when spring hit and the snows melted. The roads turned to mud that got into everything, clogged up wheels and destroyed machinery. It effectively stopped supply chains and fucked reinforcements.<br><br>That did FAR more to hamper the war effort than that first winter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But it's not like Japan is particularly entitled to wait until everyone else apologized, <br>They don't have to apologize for shit like Unit 731 because Americans decided it's a 'good thing' in the end. Took the results and pardoned the leaders responsible.</br></br>  <br> Seriously? Most people don't realise that? <br><br>Of course not. Most people think the government really knows best and really has their best interests at heart, save for a few rotten apples. Then vote based on sympathy, tribal links and what the media tells them.</br></br></br>  <br> losing this many troops and getting a ship heavily damaged in the process of fortifying an island without any enemy resistance whatsoever <br> not retarded </br></br>  <br>Goth loli? Not really, she is overall doing pretty fine.<br><br>I guess she murders people to vent her sexual frustrations when she is not doing it for justice, but that only happens when armed people are murdering each other anyways.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fact that you compared her regen to Deadpool's tells me you understand Rory's regen...and then your claim that Deadpool could be permanently killed tells me you understand nothing about Deadpool.</br></br>   "warrior bunnies"   <br>I'm sure the alternative; fighting an army of probably 1 million soldiers outfitted with dragons is way fucking worse</br>  <br>Did you miss the not part of notRomans?</br>  <br> Gee there's some fog <br> Better shoot each other even though we have radios and could contact each other to find out who is in the area </br></br>  <br>You might have a local representative who really does care about you, if you're lucky.</br>  <br>The problem was that Hitler had no grasp of logistics in the first place.<br><br>There was that one time he tried to resupply an encircled German force entirely by air rather than give them permission to break out of the encirclement. This was done with no appreciation of how much they actually needed in supplies versus how much supplies the Luftwaffe could carry every day, in the end they got something like a fifth of what they needed.</br></br></br>  <br>But the fat morphine addict totally promised he could do it, and as we all know he always followed through on his promises</br>  <br>Portable CIWS and .50 cals<br>BRRRRRRRRRRT. Still can't meet up.<br>We're just too damn efficient at killing.</br></br></br>  <br> I guarantee if the Japanese had just rolled up and taken over if the Americans hadn't fortified those islands, you'd be calling Americans stupid for not realizing the Japanese would be taking those islands.  <br><br>But that is literally what happened. The Japanese rolled up and took those islands without any military resistance on the part of the United States. The majority of the Aleutian Islands (except for Dutch Harbor) were completely undefended and almost entirely unoccupied by US civilian or military assets. Of the two islands the Japanese invaded there was only the small seal hunting settlement of Attu Island, and a weather station on Kiska. <br><br>The only strategic value in the islands was the Japanese trying to stop the US from threatening the Japanese from the Northern Pacific and later by using it as a diversion for the Battle of Midway. They attempted to make the US Navy believe they had significant surface and carrier assets in the area by half-heartedly bombing Dutch Harbor and were planning an invasion of greater Alaska. Everyone knew that they weren't though, nobody was fooled.<br><br>The "Battle" of Kiska was a huge fucking mistake. The occupying Japanese force had pulled off the island and were halfway back to Japan. American soldiers landed and tried to set up camp, but the weather went bad (one of the main reasons the Japanese pulled out) and a lot of soldiers got sick, died of hypothermia, or tripped Japanese boobytraps. The battle part of the battle occurred when a American unit and a Canadian unit failed to identify each other through fog and proceeded to kill each other.<br><br>There was no reason for them to ever land on the island or attempt to fortify it when it had been obvious upon arriving there that the Japanese had ended their operation and pulled out two weeks prior. Especially since American battleships accidentally fired on radar blips they through were Japanese surface ships, which turned out to be birds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But they got rekt by almost every zombie apocalypse setting.</br>  <br> oppressing your people on stolen land <br><br>I don't recall Americans being in Japan, but okay<br><br> implying you have an obligation to sell oil to people <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's talking about Poland, I don't know why but he is</br>  <br><br> gee the USA has twice our population and five times our industrial output with tremendous resources <br> let's attack them <br><br>Then, 75 years later<br><br> argh usa is so dumb I am a faggy foreigner whose shitty socialist country is able to fund its shitty socialist programs because the usa picks up our defense fuck we would be so relevant if we didn't have the usa doing that and we paid for our own military forces and then invaded someone else for more clay <br><br>Subhuman foreigners have no right to speak about anything, you are our bitches because you are dumber than we are on the whole<br><br>Deal.with.it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't know why, but I'm overwhelmed with feels during the "whooh whaoooah" part of the OP (with the military doing cool shit), especially during the pic-related moment. Instead of showing them as scary guys in uniforms, it's friendship and helping others and I love this kind of portrayal.<br><br>Am I falling into JSDF's trap? If I were a nihonjin, would I go sign up tomorrow?</br></br>  <br>ah! Zombies, those undead creatures with no feeling of pain or FEAR right? Well no shit... but the riders are human...<br>Any dragon rider would probably shit their iron panties if they had half of their MIGHTY forces gunned down in a hot second.<br>Like with their ground troops, they become fearful and disoriented upon realizing the might of their enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>This is cool as well.</br>  <br>The Japanese may have been pants on head retarded back then but that doesn't mean the Americans didn't goof up either.</br>  See what happens if you walk into an area fenced by the military.  <br>The middle guy's head looks like it was made by ufotable.</br>  <br>OK, so that excuses an absolute fiasco occupation of an island with literally NO hostile forces on it that serves zero strategic gain? Interesting opinion</br>  <br>I don't intend to make this a massive war of figure pointing or anything but where and how did those become the facts? <br>I mean I've never been interested in those but all I heard about them were:<br>1) Someone went through Rus/Chi reeducation touting<br>2) American pre or war time propaganda<br>3) Russian report<br>4) Happened because it happened.<br><br>Not that I'm saying it never happened but if claim alone makes the truth, oh well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The problem was that Hitler had no grasp of logistics in the first place. <br>Hitler: So, those Panzer divisions are pretty well organized and led, with fantastic logistical support far superior to any nation in the world at this time.<br><br>Gudarian: Yeah, thank yo-<br><br>Hitler: What if I split the regiments to make more Panzer divisions without actually having to produce new tanks or train new crews?<br><br>Gudarian: No please do not.<br> <br>Hitler: I will get Gobbels to tell everyone that these are in fact new divisions that Germany made because we are so fucking industrially advanced.<br><br>Gudarian: Do not do that it will destroy the operational strength of the unit<br><br>Hitler: And then fill in the gaps in the division with regiments of captured tanks that will require completely different parts that are not interchangeable with our core units, thus making our logistics needlessly complex. <br><br>Gudarian: No I don't think you understand how this works<br><br>Hitler: So instead of having an entire division of experienced veterans, we will have a division made up of half veteran units and half completely green units<br><br>Gudarian: No please stop why the fuck would you do that<br><br>Hitler: Too late</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Angry MPs come over with m9s and tell you to go the fuck away while trying to look tough and intimidating with their small stature.</br>  How did they learn their language?<br><br><br><br>Is this ever explained in the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br> counter-warcrimes <br> not warcrimes <br>Oh, wow.</br></br></br>  <br> not apologizing for WW2 era war crimes and shit <br>The Emperor himself offered to do that but MacArthur wouldn't even meet with him so he said "fuck it"</br></br>  <br>that has nothing to do with honor - if you are geting attacked, you are free to use everything you have at hand.<br><br>If those lowtechs continue to attack instead of talking to each other - it is their own fault.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that's what all military is supposed to do during peacetime?<br><br>Its not that surprising, miscommunication and friendly fire occurs all the time since there are no advanced radars and combat network. More fun would be Halsey running his fleet straight into a typhoon.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typho<wbr>on_Cobra_(1944)</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>The officer also had a handbook out of which he learned the world's language. But it doesn't made sense. If they had time in these 3 months to send out scouts and they could gather enough to learn the language, how come they are still completely clueless about the world?</br>  <br>That really doesn't excuse the catastrophe that was the American military in the Aleutian Campaign though.<br><br>They really did fuck up super hard regardless of what any other country's military was doing at the time.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The JSDF captured around 6000 prisoners from the failed invasion.</br></br>  <br>They probably went to one of the villages before and tried to communicate with a guy who looked the smartest. One or two days of chilling out and you can start putting up together their sounds and letters. Fool around a little more, you know how to greet yourself. Make small handbooks in the meantime for your troops to understand the village signs. Hire a couple of linguists, send them through the gate and after a week you should have 1000 common words.

Fuck off, no one wants to hear your shit.</br>  <br>Please remember he wins if you reply.</br>  <br>I don't give a shit and this thread is shit anyway</br>  <br>This manga has reached the point where I am more hyped for the secondaries than the supposed protagonists. So I am served if Ishida gives me CCG vs Matsumae's group.</br>  <br>Im just fucking sick of the memory bullshit. How much longer will this go on?<br><br>Fuck, why did Ishida have to combine amnesia with a timeskip. Those two are what usually kills series.</br></br></br>  <br> How much longer will this go on? <br>Until volume 6, because muh parallels.<br> why did Ishida have to combine amnesia with a timeskip. <br>Because it fits the Fool's Journey. As I have been saying what fucked Haise's character is his obsession and fear to get rip of the lies the CCG has been feeding him. As an anon said past week this is a degradation of what Ishida did with Kaneki in chapter 140. <br>Haise wants to keep his fake family and protect Kaneki's friends, which obviously is impossible, the pussy will have to learn what Kaneki learned with Yamori.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the point where I am more hyped for the secondaries than the supposed protagonists <br>And when this happen you know that Ishida is aiming to reach Kubo's level. <br>I can't believe that Pierrot's little moments of Anteiku's SoL entertained me more than the MCs' panels time.</br></br></br>   mfw the only reason i've been keeping up with the manga is for both the reverse trap and the regular trap.  <br>When did it all go wrong?</br>  <br>I'm just waiting for best dad to show.</br>  <br> When did it all go wrong? <br>That she is a shit tier trap. Asa was a glorious trap, but she is just a novel character.</br></br>  <br> When did it all go wrong? <br>I don´t know, ask your parents why you are so a retarded failure.</br></br>  <br>Actually like the design of this one. Hell, everything else aside, I like to think one of Ishida's main qualities is good traps.</br>  <br> is good traps <br>Suzuya is a good-looking-not-trap.<br>Kanae has a girly-air.<br>The only true trap is such a shit. Why is this allowed?</br></br></br></br>  Best boy saying sth important like  Haise, you are a faggot   <br> the reverse trap <br>Anon, you have issues.</br></br>  <br>How does such a little thing like pic related can have more balls than such a shit like Haise? I remember that time where someone made a joke about cutting Haise's moon balls and putting them on trap's brown ass </br>  <br>It's just old Kaneki in kid form.</br>  <br>Because he is the biggest jobber in CCG.</br>  <br> he is the biggest jobber in CCG <br>If I were Autisma I would look for another pet.</br></br>  what if ishidas goal was to make us dislike haise but tumblr gobbled that shit up  <br>Since where does dumblr's opinion matter?</br>  I hate these weird several month timeskips that are always in TG. Why is Haise going to ask about the mask in April?  <br>Because he needs permission for everything even for his existence.</br>  <br><br>Just waiting for the shitty amnesiac arc to end so the story can fucking finally move along.</br></br>  <br>Landwhales are so cheap to buy, put add a character shedding a tear and they will accept as the great tragedy. And they hate stereotypes, those girls sure are over dramatic.</br>  <br><br>You know what amuses me? That Haise clearly stated he was having painful flashblacks, but still the pussy goes to see Kaneki's friend to ask about Kaneki. Haise is the biggest imbecile of this manga.</br></br>  <br>Because the fungus kills the insect at the end of spring.</br>  <br> the fungus kills the insect at the end of spring </br>  <br> When did it all go wrong? <br>You know Ishida is doing things wrong the moment this artist (one of TG's iconic moon artist) stopped doing fan pics.</br></br>  Who's ready for more of nothing?  <br>Because god is dead, and we killed him. Though, to be fair, I am perfectly fine with Suzuya being the closest thing to a trap so long as things don't take a complete 180 and he ends up being shit again.</br>  <br>Honestly, at this point, if hes going to slap in more filler the very least he can do is make it remotely entertaining. Good example would be the christmas chapter or whatever the hell that was.</br>  raws any minute now  <br> the very least he can do is make it remotely entertaining <br> Good example would be the christmas chapter <br>Please, tell me you are being sarcastic.</br></br></br>  <br> more of nothing <br>Is pic related an expression or an example?</br></br>  <br>Both.</br>  Why is this manga so terrible?  <br>Because Kaneki went to sleep.</br>  <br>Why did Ishida become so disappointing?<br><br>Because the MC became a shitty beta and the other protagonists aren't better.</br></br></br>  <br>Partially, but I thought, at the very least, it was a change of pace. Which is something we desperately fucking need.</br>  <br>Why the fuck do they have to keep reinforcing his mom demeanor? Like, it wouldn't be so bad if he was actual capable of being anything but a complete jobber? For fucks sake, I'm starting to get hard pressed to find a "protagonist" whose remotely competent.</br>  <br>Surprisingly fit image.</br>  I just want to see homo prince be useful if he supposedly has some level of kakuja now.  <br> Hirako Take <br> embarrassment; a waste of human effort <br><br>And the suffer continues</br></br></br></br>  All this whining must mean ishida is going to deliver to shut you guys up. Again.  <br>Am I the only one who doesn't mind re.<br><br>Also is Haise really that different from Kaneki?</br></br></br>  <br><br> shush, anons <br> don´t you remember we have to bitch about everything until spoilers arrive? <br> Gee, try to be more considerated </br></br></br></br>  Why do so many people hate tsukiyama now? That guy was okay in the first series.  <br>Because tumblr likes him. I'm serious.</br>  <br> considerate*, sorry </br>  <br>I think some people hate him cause he is irrelevant to the plot. If you removed him from the story (or if he didn't exist at all) nothing major would probably change.<br><br>And fujo.</br></br></br>  <br> irrelevant to the plot <br>Any one that ties back to the original story is more relevant than most of the Qs.</br></br>  Many people on dumblr just want a merge, I don't even think a trash like Haise should merge with eyepatch  <br>He was useful for a while when kaneki form his own group during the first series.</br>  <br><br>Ishida seems to be pushing the idea that Haise and Kaneki aren't different considering Hinami's reactions to Haise's behavior and Uta's comments to Yomo.</br></br>  <br>Being this retarded</br>    I hate Hide.

He calls her Kosaka and her name is Yoriko Kosaka</br>  <br>did she spit on her hand?</br>  <br> the pussy will have to learn what Kaneki learned with Yamori. <br>I don't know anon, I still can see Haise as MC for a while and there's a chance of "merging" At this point I've lost all my hopes of seeing Don Kaneki's return.  Ishida may deliver it. I guess  <br><br><br> I am more hyped for the secondaries than the supposed protagonists. <br>This is funny. I actually don't give a fuck about Haise, but can't wait to know more about Amon/Floppy, Clowns and any Aogiri member: Noro, Eto, Tatara, Orca, etc  even Ayashit and Seidou  <br><br>Remember when /a/ thought Haise would be Arima-tier investigator?

Fuck this shit.</br></br></br></br>   yfw Hirako is transferred to Arima's squad.  <br> fuck this shit, how is that even possible </br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>it seems like CCG made Hirako Arima's assistant. Partner?<br>His face doesn't look that happy to me.</br></br>  <br>Of course he isn't happy. Now one again he has to stick to Autisma 24/7 who's shitting on him because he doesn't have dem autism skills.</br>  <br><br>So apparently, Hirako hasn't suffered enough so they assigned him to Arima AGAIN.</br></br>   Hirako Stand By   <br>.01 second</br>  Arima must see something in Hirako right?<br>Honestly, why else would he still work with him?</br>  <br>CCG has to choose the most poker face guy in their entire force because other guys have resigned. Hirako on the other hand doesn't have the will to complain.</br>  <br>Because CCG assigns Hirako to him.</br>   Kuramoto feels uneasy about this transfer <br>Reminder that Kuramoto understands Hirako and how many shit he has to put up with, and now seeing his reaction to this.</br>    <br>Fuck this shit, I'm uploading this tomorrow. <br>Fuck Arima.</br></br>  <br/>  Bumping this thread for the ones who still need to see the spoilers<br>Say thank you to Uriefag and Mutsukifag</br>  Fuck this.

Grow a thicker skin when you're here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that retard from before <br>Care to elaborate?</br></br>  <br>he's not. haise is quite literally just kaneki if he were happier, and free of stress. calling him a beta is essentially calling kaneki a beta. <br><br>wanting him to have fucking white hair again is cringey as fuck considering it indicates you only enjoy the le edge. haise is top tier.. he just needs to give autisma a punch to the nuts, and get away from the ccg. but keep that personality and drop the edge shit</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care about people that shit on me since we are on a anonymous imageboard. Why should I care about it? I just express my opinions and what I believe.</br>  <br>You told people to fuck themselves.<br>It means that you actually share when people shit on you.</br></br>  <br>care*<br><br><br>Haise is good as he is but he should stay at the CCG and keep working for King Autisma. He can also keep training master Urie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you know that? What if I just saying shit since most of you just disagreeing with me? Just leave it and let's move on.</br>  <br>I'm not saying this to insult you, but if you react to people shitting on you then it logically means you care.<br><br>I'll post a random pic.</br></br></br>    <br>Based Ishida</br>  <br> kaneki_nipples </br>  <br>Can someone identify the book Haise is holding in the bottom middle panel?</br>  <br>His x-mas present</br>  <br><br><br>Look at all that black hair.  Whitehairfags BTFO </br></br></br>  <br>Oh, my bad. I thought it was different book.</br>  Wait.<br>Haise got the mask as a christmas present.<br>More than 4 months passed since then.<br><br>Why is he going to HySy know? Why did he wait so long?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing a little torture and centipede to the ear won't fix.</br>  <br>Probably he had to figure out the location of HySy, also he probably has a busy schedule.</br>  <br><br>FemAutism is cute.<br><br><br>Is that Yoriko? 8/10 would eat her bread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Probably he had to figure out the location of HySy <br><br>This.<br><br>I really doubt Uta's shop is easy to find.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Takeomi schlong status: Erected</br>  <br>Apparntly Haise asked Uta about his eyes and he replied that those are just tattooed.</br>  <br>You're joking right ?<br><br>Haise can't be this much of a fucking idiot right ?</br></br></br>  <br>I know that eye tatoos are a thing, but seriously : why would anyone in the Tokyo Ghoul world have eyes tatoos similar to kakugans when showing a kakugan means "attack on sight" for the doves ?<br>Especially when running a mask shop (which is apparently hard to find), when masks are something worn mostly by ghouls ?<br>AND when you are sending a ghoul mask to a half ghoul for christmas ?<br>Haise cannot be that gullible, right ?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Look at his face, does it look like he's buying it?</br></br>  <br><br>The original Kaneki was scared of Uta<br>Of course Haise feels the same and doesn't believe him<br>The pic proves it</br></br></br></br>  <br>But what if Uta actually told the truth about his eyes</br>  <br>Why is Uta even lying? I guess because Haise's an investigator but he came alone, all Uta needed to do is saying he's one of Kaneki's old friends.</br>  <br>For what purpose? To end in jail instead of being killed?</br>  <br>Haise has been shown to be sympathetic towards ghouls. The CCG doesn't know that he's at HySy and he probably has a hunch that Uta was lying about sending the mask to the wrong address. Haise maybe assumes that Uta was a valued acquaintance of Uta, thus he's not further pursuing the matter.</br>  What would you do in this situation?  <br>Why is 4chan fucked up now.

I thought maybe it just hadn't fully replenished from last time, but again today it's the same amount. I took a look at my stats and noticed my mod power seemed lower, and after comparing it to a comment I had made back in February confirmed that it is now 3 less than what it used to be.</br>  I don't like Okina that much but I respect her for the incredible amount of constant reativity she puts in all her stories, especially those longer than just a couple of chapters.  <br> her <br>Stop the memes please</br></br>    One page a week <br><br>Why are /western/ so fucking lazy? <br><br>Anyways, MILF with small breasts/big ass?

The only things i do that could affect my sleep could be:<br>Lack of sleep, cant sleep in peace if i do, sleeping late and waking up late, etc.</br></br>  <br><br>Typically being aware you're in a dream but not awake enough to become conscious. Bonus: if you wake up during lucid dreaming you can be in sleep paralysis and start experiencing hallucinations!</br></br>  <br>Google Search 'ehentai reader android'</br>  <br>Should i be worried about them? Its not the first time it happens, the last 3 times were wet dreams too but it happens once every 2~5 months.<br>They don't sound that bad.</br></br>  <br>Good luck.<br>I'm still looking for a good one for regular manga.</br></br>  <br><br>No. Lucid dreaming is something you have to work at to get better. Typically involves having a dream diary and trying to recall your dreams immediately upon waking. And sleep paralysis tends to happen most if you sleep on your back. Wet dreams are something else.</br></br>  <br> no YnD in an anal thread <br>http://exhentai.org/g/255822/4a46a9<wbr>fbf3/</wbr></br></br>  <br>I see, thanks for the explanation, i will try to search more about them since this is interesting and something that started to happen with more frequency.</br>  Get onboard Pop9's wild ride /a/.  <br>ComicRack is the best comic reader there is.</br>  <br>http://g.e-hentai.org/tools.php?act<wbr>=track_expunge</wbr></br>  <br>Thank you moral guardians.</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll check it out.<br>I've been using Mango, which has some nice features but which has some bugs and gets an update about once every year.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks again anon.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/826878/7be285<wbr>60f9/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/823007/7cd48d<wbr>beff/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/822910/80ffd3<wbr>bdae/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821292/b8c318<wbr>da9c/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/820046/155be9<wbr>3e5d/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821320/281c83<wbr>3a1b/<br><br>Fuck these niggers.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br>and this is why we have the panda</br>  <br> anyhoo <br> not anywho </br></br>  <br>They'ren't talking about persons, the're talking about Hoos!</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/831775/8c3a68<wbr>d782/</wbr>  <br>nalvas, fresh off the press<br>http://exhentai.org/g/831787/5fd8d7<wbr>cb4e/<br><br>BIG TITS EDITION</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> anal <br>http://exhentai.org/g/830382/a6a867<wbr>16c7/</wbr></br></br>  Can you do better job at editing than this?<br><br>http://exhentai.org/s/be03c2bb79/83<wbr>1795-1</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yes.
