[ let's talk about how good looking Maria is in her new gear.<br>old thread </br>   Linking old thread <br>This isn't /m/ we don't need this.<br><br>And yes, Maria suddenly became cool and useful looking with the new opening. I'm still kinda sad she didn't have a shield though.</br></br></br>  <br>a shield would make her more perfect than she already is and that would be bad for the other characters.</br>  <br>Why have a sheild when you could just have a bigger sword?</br>  The dolls don't actually seem to be very good at fighting. Both Chris and Tsubasa would have had the advantage if they weren't just able to lean on being nigh-indestructible with their current armament.  Predict what will happen in the end /a/  <br>Why have swords when you can bash people with your shield?</br>  <br> Why have a sheild when you could just have a bigger sword? <br>so Phara's opponent was actually Maria the whole time!<br>and you guys call her usesless.</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki will die and be resurrected.<br><br>Miku will have her memories of Hibiki drained, but fall for her all over again anyway.<br><br>in the more short term, the FIS girls will probably end up overcoming their LiNKER dependency somehow, given Kirika and Shirabe's concerns this episode.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Clara and dolls will die, Elf9 will be befriended, Maria will be redeemed and revive Zwei Wing with Tsubasa, DMJii will still be dykes, Chris will still be a whore and  Hibiki will be standing in front of Miku's tombstone. </br>  <br> Clara </br>  <br>I fugged up</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  I want to break these girls out of their lesbianism.    <br>Tsubasa isn't used to being wielded by someone else.</br>  Commie or H&amp;D?  <br>A guy pointed it out before and I didn't really see it until after the 3rd rewatch. What's with her moving like a ninja? Did Ogawa teach her or something?</br>  Ep 2 felt so slow.  Garie sounds like a fusion of Aoi Yuuki and Chiwa Saito  <br>No idea, I don't think it's necessarily ninja style, just some kind of agile rogue style. Which is really unexpected, I thought she'd be the tank.</br>  <br>Commie for natural english but bullshit songs' lyrics and stupid localization.<br>H&amp;D for accurate translation but somewhat stiff dialog. <br>Choose your destiny or watch both.</br></br></br>    Who is ready for this?  <br> I thought she'd be the tank. <br>Me too. The armored look she gives off didn't make me think she'd choose a faster style. Here's hoping she gets a bow just for laughs.</br></br>  They need to fix how they are muxing the songs into the episode. They sing them live like in S1 but enemy dialog and other sound effects are at the same levels as the songs. I could barely hear Hibiki's new song and didn't like it until I listed to the sample from the CD.  Those are some killer legs.  <br>Shouldn't it be Hibiki? Miku gets Gungnir confirming that Gungnir's a slut that would activate for a lot of people.</br>  <br>your mother's hips felt so slow.</br>  <br>Maybe King Records forced them to do it to increase CD sales. Oy vey. </br>    <br/>  <br> being a jew </br>    Carol talks like an old lady eternal loli confirmed.  <br>how much for the night? I have me shekels ready.</br>  <br>Old lady voices turn me on then, I guess.</br>  http://commiesubs.com/senki-zesshou<wbr>-symphogear-gx-02/</wbr>  <br>She uses "Ore" so it makes her an old man.</br>    <br>I wish I could hurt you right now.</br>  <br>You post that like I would even check let alone download it.</br>   ever downloading Commie's fanfiction and guess-translation  <br>Why are you people so impatient.</br>  <br>She can get sword training from Tsubasa.</br>  <br> Exterminate <br>You better tell me it's sung by Takagaki Ayahi</br></br>    <br>Where have you been the last few weeks?<br>Exterminate is the new Nana OP.</br></br>  <br>It gives me a legitimate excuse to re-watch the episode  at least  one more time.</br>  <br>Not in Symphogear threads for sure.</br>  <br>NASA fucked up and forgot to deploy the gears with their shuttle.</br>  I have a feeling Hibiki is ugly in real life like most japs. The only ones that would be attractive are Tsubasa and Miku. Chris would be ugly too but with tits, so it kinda breaks even. for her.  The new blade effect on Tsubasa's spin to win move is so cash.  <br>Then why does Miku want Bikki's bikkies so badly?</br>  <br>Go to hell yada yada one of you must have the image.</br>  <br> using 3DPD logic <br>There is no real life Hibiki. Hibiki is as cute as she is.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is ugly in the anime so it doesn't change much. Chris wouldn't be ugly because she's only half nip.</br>  <br>Lets see how ugly you look after you say that to her face.</br>  <br> Hibiki is ugly in the anime <br><br>You're fucking dead.</br></br></br>    <br>Girls that talk like old men turn me on ~jyaro? </br>  <br> Hibiki is ugly in real life <br>So ugly.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Look at her and tell me she's not ugly. What the fuck is that hair? Literally every girl in this picture looks better than her.</br></br></br>  Senpai is truly the coolest.  <br> Onsen episode will never happen <br>SATELIGHT WHY!</br></br>    <br>Stop Bike abuse. Seeing this happen every OP is just disgusting.</br>  <br>Someone is missing.</br>  <br>You will see Bike-kun get blown up every episode.</br>  I just wonder will the doll VAs show up in 2016 live event and be a dancer when Symphogear VAs singing.  <br>Maria will blow up every car she's driving and Tsubasa will blow up every bike.<br>It's perfect</br></br>  <br>Shirabe's hips make me want to commit a crime.</br>  <br>Those tits are rebelling against that seatbelt.</br>  <br>Miku isn't superficial. What she has is true love.</br>  <br>More like Kaneko WHY?<br>He had hard time to write fanservice scenes and will obviously avoid it as long as no one force him to do it. You can just hope Agematsu or Anime staff used Majority rule to decide the plot again as S2.</br></br>  <br>Shirabe and Kirika are gross and annoying when they speak.</br>  Exterminate is probably my favourite of the OPs, sorry Synchrogazer.<br>I just can't help it with that "TOKIHANATE SUBETE WO"</br>  <br>Doesn't make dem hips any less illegal dess</br>  <br> just hope the staff decided to fuck up the plot again <br><br>No?</br></br></br>  <br>EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAATE<br>The more I listen to it the more I like it, and the more I like it the more I listen to it. I think I have a problem.</br></br>      <br>Sluts.</br>  <br>Exterminate is one of those songs you can listen again and again without getting tired</br>     we need to make chris even cuter in GX season, how do we do it? <br> make her hug a loli <br>And that, they say, was the fastest meeting they ever had during pre-production.</br></br>  In S2 I found the "inshow" versions of the songs by far superior. But somehow they dont sound as well this time.<br>why</br>  <br>Episode 2's reaction should have Miku hats</br>  <br>Considering the actual discussions they had about the type of underwear Hibiki wears, I wonder what they talked about when deciding what to make Elf9 wear.</br>  <br>I don't get this meme.</br>  <br>imagine in the last episode when "exterminate" moves came out and at the same time nana sang the EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAATE!! part...<br>can you handle it?</br></br>  <br>I think you have the same problem as this guy<br/></br>  <br>See the archives.</br>  <br>The end card of the ED has Miku's head popping up over Kirika's when she hadn't been present in the entire sequence. It kinda looked like Kirika was wearing her head as a hat.</br>  <br> No post-fisting K2 in the background </br>  <br>They also seem like they have a limited amount of time to fight, considering they need absorb kiss energy all of the time.</br>  <br> tfw it's sound producer messed up his work this time </br>  Did we have subs already at this time last week?  <br>No this show has no simulcasts and like 3 new songs per episode. You will be lucky to get meme subs within 48 hours.</br>  <br>Garie said Micha is a big eater that the memories she collected is not enough(to activate Micha O guess).</br>  <br>Its not the same without awesome singing.</br>   tfw listening to Ressou Gungnir  <br><br>You were good for one thing Maria</br></br>    Commie should be any minute now, looks like they're done on their progress page.<br><br>https://c.milkteafuzz.com/#/shows/a<wbr>iring</wbr></br></br>  <br>I like it. The noodles looked a bit strange anyway.</br>  <br> 3 translators <br>Did they assign 1 translator per song?</br></br>  <br>But what if the fact her CD comes almost last  is because she will have to use Gungnir, as Hibiki is temporarily out of the game? <br> Maria version of HIBIKE HIBIKE when </br></br>  <br>We need to put bushi-Noise in there somehow</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be better to make a clear-cut discontinuity in the silhouette of their heads so that they resemble the K2? The way it is they just look like they have some malformation.</br>  <br>And a banana... My drawing skills aren't up to creating something out of nothing though.</br>  <br> no one will do Hibiki suplexing the couch </br>  <br>Make the second tallest guy the third tallest.</br>  <br>Oh shit we need drawfag-kun to get on this.</br>  <br/>    <br>Wait, they discussed what underwear Hibiki wears?</br>      <br>S1 director made a speech about why Hibiki wears purple underwear after s1 finale on his Twitter.</br>  <br>Oh hey, another thread about this garbage. <br><br>Did this ever get better? Season 1 and 2 were nearly unwatchable and I don't think I can put myself through another season of this cringe bait.</br></br></br>  <br> Aoi will never cosplay Hibiki like her grandma wants </br>  <br>Do you like suplexing space shuttles and punching K2 in half?</br>  Any news when subs will be out?    <br> bait <br>Something here is bait, that's for sure.</br></br>  <br>It's bait. Don't reply.</br>  <br>Her face in the second frame looks like something from the original Transformers cartoon</br>  <br>At least we get Hibiki cosplaying as Aoi.</br>  <br>get bored more often, anon.</br>    <br>What was that reason?</br>  http://commiesubs.com/commie-subs-t<wbr>-shirt/<br>pls buy more t-shirts</br></wbr>  Who FIS here? I'm glad it seems like they are going to be main characters and not just side characters like I originally feared.  Still no subs?  <br>Now I want to see Maria pinching Tsubasa and otherwise lightly bullying her because embarrassed sword is the cutest. <br>Tsubasa probably hasn't had anyone who'd intrude into her personal space since Kanade died, since Hibiki has too much respect of her, Chris is too reserved and her parents are probably dead. Poor girl is in dire need of forceful skinship.</br></br>  <br> Everyone talks about how alpha Tsubasa is <br> Came just from having her arm grabbed </br></br>  <br> forceful skinship </br>  <br/>  <br>Maria is my favorite  living  character, but I'm more or less indifferent on Kirika and Shirabe. Sure they're c/u/te as fuck but they don't really... contribute that much.</br>  <br>She's a sword, she can't resist when she's being wielded.</br>  <br>We need a symphogear bait image.</br>  <br>He thought Hibiki might buy them because they're very cheap and thought since no one will see what colors of underwear she wears it doesn't matter what color they are.</br>  <br>Please, Maria is far too useless to intentionally do something like that. It needs to be mutual forceful skinship.</br>  <br>what does FIS even mean?</br>  <br>I could of sworn I've seen "Listen to my Bait" before.</br>  <br>F-sharp</br>  <br>Federal Institutes of Sacrist</br>  <br>She was the one taking the picture, moron.</br>  <br>Fine<br>Is<br>Shirabe</br></br></br>  <br>I didnt see Hibiki's purple underwear in the last episode of S1</br>  <br>Determination to FIS T </br>  <br>Sorry I mean he made a speech after S1E13 aired.</br>  I had a dream last night that episode 7 was out and we all referred to it as the Character Nuke, because EVERYONE died. All three main girls, the FIS girls, Genjuuro, and Miku. The episode started like the S1E1 did, with cup-chan and announcer-kun at a big grave especially for the members of S.O.N.G. At the end it turned out that not everybody had died, but most of them had - only Hibiki, Maria, and Chris were still alive at the end.<br><br> There was so much suffering. </br></br>  <br> no one will see what colors of underwear she wears <br>But Miku</br></br>  <br>TLDR</br>  <br>i need this</br>  <br> Killing off Tsubasa <br>Why would your subconscious do that?</br></br>  <br>You need a hug anon?<br>What a horrible dream</br></br>  I want to fist Chris.  <br>They literally drew her without pantsu in a few frames.</br>  <br>Elf9 pls</br>  <br> Character Nuke <br>If we ever get something similar I'll be calling it that.</br></br>  <br>It's an edit.</br>  <br>Her fluff will stop you.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah except Miku. Someone asked the director that if Hibiki and Miku exchange each others' underwears, he answered he will leave it to audience's imagination.</br>    <br><br>Fine Is Sex.</br></br>  <br> he will leave it to audience's imagination <br>Stealth "yes" answer since the audience was already asking him about it.</br></br>  <br>Don't friends usually do this normally?</br>  <br>this was an edit from the anon in the last thread.</br>  <br>That's what you get for not being in every thread up to date.</br>  <br> Too many spoilers, and I come home from work and there's a thousand new posts ;_; </br>  OK WHAT THE FUCK<br>Answer me this:<br><br>Those cunts are killing people. They probably just killed 40ish unit squad of solders.<br><br>WHY ARE THEY LETTING THEM GO? IS THIS A FUCKING GAME?<br>THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE.<br><br>If I was one of them I'D FUCKING SHOOT THEM DOWN before they went singing. No drama, no nothing. What are the lives of 2 enemy cunts compared to the hundreds that you save.<br><br>Seriously, answer me this? Isn't Tsubasa a 'weapon' that has no feelings. She should seriously carry a gun and just shoot the motherfuckers up. That way she'll save the lives of all those solders with families and basically make their job a ton easier because they don't have to deal with 3 gear users but only 1. Hell they can finish this by the evening and still have enough time to hit the clubs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They say that some dreams are premonitions to what can happen in the future.<br>If it happens it will be all your fault for dreaming anon.</br></br>  <br>But americans are not people, silly.</br>  <br>Swords can't carry guns.</br>  <br>Front Islamique du Salut<br><br>A terrorist organization responsible for a bloody war in algeria during the 90's</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's the military's own fault if they send soldiers on certain death missions.</br></br>  <br>But they're so cute.</br>  <br>FIS wasn't killing anyone until Ver starts going ham with the Noise.<br><br>Kirika and Shirabe were never responsible for any deaths that happened.</br></br></br>  damn you guys I spent half an hour trying to remember where S1 had the bath scene where Miku tickles Hibiki, hoping to see the underwear somewhere. Then i checked S2<br>didnt find it, gave up.</br>  <br>Wasn't the only one killing people Ver?</br>  <br>Their children and never actually killed anyone. Ver was always holding the cane and Maria killed like 5 guys. I fucking hate them but they are retarded and not to blame and</br>  I don't understand Marias hair.  Damn I only just realized that "Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist." would be the final episode title.  <br>1, <br>2, Wasn't the Symphogear project still a secret at that point? They couldn't well justify the murder of two young girls without having to either expose the Symphogear program or have the killer arrested<br><br><br>Miracles cannot be understood, anon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LEWD</br>  <br>They are HELPING the bad guys. The bad guys are killing people directly. They know it.<br><br>They need to die, on sight, to avoid the shit that could have happened like last season. As easy as that. Can't fight them with an armor on? Fuck it, get a gun and shoot them. Or a sniper rifle.<br><br>They die, suddenly they've lost 2 whole gear users and the enemy no longer has any advantage. They can not inflict any huge damage and you've saved a ton of people's lives. The 3 can finish off Marie or Fine or whatever with a single swan song. gg well played.<br><br>Everyone is a fucking retard. Hell, if you have a sniper rifle you can basically just dismember one of their legs and that'll convince them to stop being cunts and not fight. And modern prostetics are so advanced they can probably not lose much functionality. And you've not killed them. Everyone wins, right?<br><br>Everything could be so much simpler, but no. Let them kill our solders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 6</br>  <br>And Exterminate will be the name of their final combination attack.</br>  <br>It doesn't follow the laws of the universe.</br>   that feel when Fine will never return and sing together with the maincast   <br>A gun isn't a secret. They can use poison darts if they don't want to make any noise. Heck, they can sedate them, get their gems/relics/whatever.</br>  <br>No one gives a shit about faceless soldiers.<br>If you want a realistic war anime watch something else, this is about singing and punching.</br></br>  <br>How is Sawashiro at singing?</br>  <br>Two shortswords? Who is she now, Archer? The Gungnir spear fit her better. Or a sword and shield.<br><br><br>Go away, Tsubasa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. I'll do just that. I'll watch Gundam Zeta.</br>  <br>She only has one doesn't she?</br>  <br>I hate to say this, but you're not watching this correctly.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GoX<wbr>uWS6W5IQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Ep1, 3, 6.<br><br>Pic is from episode 6.</br></br></br>  <br>My mistake, I haven't watched the episode yet  subs when  and her waist armor looked like another sword. Still a strange style for her.</br>  <br>I haven't started this but I'm so glad Naomi got an actual role for real.</br>  <br>Ver's malicious killings and Maria's self-defense killings were kept secret from the lolis. They were thinking they were the heroes up until Ver started Noising the boats which caused Shirabe to go down and help.</br>  <br>Only one, with some sort of chain blade attached to it.<br><br> also the word "Verify" in captchas makes me think "Ver-ify," as in turning more people into Vers </br></br></br>  <br>It acts in a way that's convenient for the scene. It spreads out in neat little bunches like tentacles to cover specific areas on posters or on her body. It acts like normal when wet or as one bunch in a ponytail but it can also act like 3-4 tails tied together.</br>  <br>Naomi was actually Maria though, who went through several courses on confidence building and woman taming.</br>  <br>It is not like no one tried to do that<br>They are all dust now</br></br>   making Tsubasa into a sub for Maria <br><br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br>They guy already corrected himself but if I think about it, there was still the sword she pulled out from her chest which looks different from the one she pulls out from her arm guard.</br>  <br>Please, Maria's was there first. Naomi stole her hair, just like that other pink haired slut in that VVV spinoff.<br>And they're all not even getting her right, the blue green eyes are just as important as the pink hair.</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa could have just pin their shadow to the ground and called for backup.<br><br><br>That was much easier to notice.</br></br></br></br>   [Commie] Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX - 02 [D9F17490].mkv   <br><br>Maybe they are sisters.</br></br>  <br> 魔法少女事変 <br> Alchemic Cult <br><br>Also, what is ヴァーサス supposed to mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>X-Drive tends to have it's own stuff though, and Maria's then was an extra special case itself.</br>  <br>Damn, should've seen the md5 part.</br>  <br><br><br>Okay, enough people fell for your bait, fuck off now.</br></br></br>  <br>Her sister is  dead </br>  <br>Versus</br>  <br>True. Airgetlam at that time did the same thing that Hibiki did. I don't really see her doing it at normal situations.</br>  <br> they never made a long version of the only good thing to come out of that shit show </br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>Tsubasa can only resist her true nature for so long.

She only managed to do it accidentally (invade Tsubasa's personal space while calling her by her name).

But yes you can think it has an innuendo in that line.</br>  I admit, the karaoke being white text for gears and black text for dolls/carol with appropriate colours as outer glow was a nice decision.  <br>The idea is that the Symphogears are going to be on the defensive this season, so I think the change in tone is appropriate.  It makes me worry about the secondary characters' well-being, though. </br>  Symphogear x Cross Ange crossover when?  <br>Every line that comes out of Maria's mouth is lewd.</br>  <br>Tsubasa and Ange trying to out-alpha each other?</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#!BMJVERCL!rmULK<wbr>oMM_YuKQ4RsFUBFvh7EgBBV40oQHE_Cr1j_<wbr>_fM</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>You just want a Nana monologue.<br><br> I approve. </br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa lost her chance at alphaness by submitting to Maria</br>  <br>Grazie.</br>  Why is Tsubasa so Alpha when Fate is so beta?  <br>deathflags everywhere</br>  <br> Implying Tsubasa is not turning into a moeblob </br>  <br>Tsubasa is what Fate would be if she was in prince-mode at all times.</br>  <br>The ED lyrics are super grim, and with Carol and the dolls talking about wanting to not just beat the geahs but to totally destroy their lives too.</br>  <br>You got me.<br><br>Ange submitted to Trucks or whatever his name was.<br><br>A starlight breaker will do that to you I guess,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The bridge will be paralyzed without you here <br>Really? You two monkeys seem to be able to run it just fine. You're cheating us out of Genjuro riding a rocket.</br></br>  <br>Maybe these Arcanoise only disintegrate Symphogears and not humans.</br>  <br>Tusk is literally Ange's bitch</br>  Literal moeblob. Yumi best girl.  <br> Ange submitted to Trucks <br>Ange submits to no one. She only makes others submit to her.</br></br>  <br>I miss Cross Ange</br>  <br>That's like an even worse death flag, because if he gets to look cool while fighting the noise he'll be wide opened to get attacked by the dolls or Carol.</br>  Wife material.  <br> not liking Nana's beta roles as much as her alpha roles </br>  <br>You can see Tsukasa's boobs jiggle too.</br>    <br> why is it that the things I treasure are the first to be destroyed? </br>  <br>Running in the 90's is now playing in your head.</br>  <br> Tsukasa </br>  <br>Phara is the best doll.</br>  <br> She's buying convenience store rice balls for when Hibki gets home <br>Are they going to adapt all the Hibiki/Miku fluff from the manga?</br></br>  <br>If this was Chris...</br>  <br>Maria's took up half the screen, Tsubasa's are hardly visible.</br>  <br>What a fucking king.</br>  <br>Sword Breaker is fucking cool.</br>    God damn the last episode was so hype that now whenever I think about symphogear I start sweating.<br>IS IT FRIDAY YET?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zh5<wbr>6H_QKnow</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br><br>Okay you guys got a point. <br>Now I want Ange and Tsubasa playing magic air lacrosse.<br> Yukarin as a symphogear villain never ;; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria should use her idol money to buy one of these.</br>  So yeah, about those noise.  <br>It's funny that she always tries to look so elegant but sometimes really silly faces slip out.</br>  <br>It’s not like she knew Hibiki would be fighting something other than flames.</br>  <br>Maria should just become one.</br>  <br>I think they're going for an uncanny/insane look, but it is pretty silly.</br>  <br>I don't see how she could make it home without running into one of those handy news TVs littered around the city.</br>  <br>Tsubasa never got all her holes filled with starlight breakers</br>  <br>Echelon</br>  <br> one of the dolls tries to eat Tsubasa's memories <br> catches a glimpse of them and of Kanade <br> creates a Kanade Noise </br></br></br>  <br>I tuckered myself out during the live stream and had to take a nap.</br>  <br>I fail to see a difference.</br>  <br>She might get them filled with Sword Breaker.</br>  <br> yfw it happens </br>  <br>Too plausible.<br><br>How are Maria and Tsubasa even going to get away at this point? Maybe Ogawa called a helicopter.</br></br></br>  So since the dolls eat memories or whatever, does this mean that the girls have to deal with their fucked up pasts yet again? Are they going to use this chance to finally retcon Chris being a sex slave to appeal to the waifufags?  <br>More like Phara and Lieur just want to kill Tsubasa and Chris' gears.</br>  <br>FUCK. I'm not sure if I want this to happen or not.</br>  <br>Maybe they do the opposite in episode 7.</br>   My father didn't leave me anything... <br><br>Poor Hibiki</br></br>  <br>He literally leave his genes to her.</br>  <br>They don't seem to have any particular qualms about killing people either. Maria has already come within inches of dying a few times.</br>  <br><br>Well, Kanade would be back, sort of.<br>Everyone wanted this to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>You have 5 days to beat Wild Arms 3 and make your own speculation now.</br>  I really like blue doll. Can't wait to see more of them.  <br> sort of <br>This is the problem. It would be too painful for Tsubasa  and my kokoro. </br></br>  <br>Also: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=agq<wbr>HoM7wesY</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Zl<wbr>yaRGalQg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Not true, he left her with plenty of emotional damage.</br>  <br><br>Fuck, that doesn't sound too implausible.  Would Kanade Noise sing too? Is she (it?) the hidden eighth singer? </br></br>  Bluedoll confirmed Carol made her, which would have been via alchemy.<br>Elf9 will presumably be granting alchemy based buffs to the geahs.<br><br>You all say Noise Kanade, but you're missing where it's really going to happen- Doll Kanade.</br></br></br>  I love Garie's voice.  <br> Doll Kanade <br>Fugg. My body is ready.</br></br>  Let's take a moment to praise all the sakuga we are receiving now that Symphogear has a moderate budget  <br><br>What kind of music would Kanade Noise sing?<br>A Merzbow remix of Gyakkou no Flügel?</br></br></br>  <br>Chris will protect her</br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>Shit, I want this really badly now.</br>  <br>Best dad. Maybe he will show up and kill Genjurou or something.</br>  <br> Doll Kanade <br> the other dolls are made from people tha died too </br></br>  <br>Keyword says Carol based the dolls on her own emotions, that's why Garie responded that way when Carol called her rotten.</br>  <br>This line is about Hibiki though.</br>  Shit I didn't like<br> Hibiki's pacifist bullshit <br> Enemy's "I'll destroy the world, and you...next time!" <br> Chris' song <br> Genjuuro on the way to kick some- no wait, fuck you I'll sit here and be wasted potential <br><br>Shit I did like<br> OP <br> Ogawa aka Clark Kent <br> Tsubasa's song <br> Dat fucking Maria </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Was Hibiki always this much of a whiny pussy?  <br> The unidentified eyes on each side belong to doll Kanade and doll Serena </br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>They look like Carol's eyes though.</br>  <br>She's never wanted to fight people. She wanted to save people.</br>  <br><br>Remember when Shirabe called her a hypocrite for being like that?</br></br>  <br>Yes, but don't worry, she eventually fists the shit out of everyone.</br>  <br>Yes. You don't remember her first encounters with Chris?</br>  Holy fuck the new Chris song is GOAT  <br>They've got slightly different shapes both from Carol's eyes and from one another. I'm pretty sure those are characters we haven't seen yet.  Neither would fit Kanade or Serena, though. I'm just fucking around. </br>  <br>They look like Fine's to me</br>  Stallman pls.  <br> Yes the only people that Hibiki actually fought were Chris and Miku. At least we're barely on the second episode so Hibiki's got time man up.</br>  <br>Last human she fought was Chris and only because she wanted to befriend her.</br>  <br><br>Fucking Obama</br></br>  This scene right here  <br>Yeah. She never laid a finger on the FIS girls. She only fought the noise to protect people.</br>  <br>It really needs a webm</br>  <br>The "Maria is useless" meme made me forget how great she actually is, fuck the haters.</br>  <br>I wonder if her alchemy is open source.</br>  <br>Determination to fist</br>  Confirmed best girl  <br>http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words<wbr>-to-avoid.en.html#Open</wbr></br>  REMOVE GAY  <br>Oh wow, her PJs has the little bird they use in the manga</br>  <br>Have you tried scrolling up</br>  <br> with superb phonic gain <br>Yeah, I can see that </br></br>  <br>http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-<wbr>source-misses-the-point.en.html<br>please educate yourself</br></wbr></br>  <br>I'm one of these useless memespouters. Maria is actually one of my favourite characters. She's just fun to bully but she's been pretty competent so far this season.</br>  <br>How many geahs would even be left at that point? They're really pushing the subtext this season.</br>  <br>Open and free(as in freedom)*<br>My fault.</br></br>    <br> Was Hibiki always this much of a whiny pussy? </br>  So when will Hibiki fist everything back to order?  <br>Being straight is literally death.</br>  <br>I have now</br>   受け入れる <br> step aside <br>Sometimes I just don't understand translators.</br></br>  <br>I have a feeling that all these straight kisses are just really an excuse to eventually have the doll kiss a Symphogeah and make it "n-no homo"</br>  <br>Just think about where Maria would have taken them if Phara didn't stop their car.</br>  <br>I think Chris is the least gay.</br>  <br>Doll-on-geah is pretty much an inevitability.</br>  <br> We'll hide out here until extraction can make it. <br> A hotel? </br></br>  <br>That's beyond obvious. The only question is who gets the kissu? Or maybe multiple kisses. This season might get too lewd.</br>  <br>best doll</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4893965<br><br>Let's settle this shit</br></br>  <br>When Carol finds a way to break her. So basically everyone wanting Hibiki to fight is on Carol's side.</br>  <br>My delusions already have her fucking the boku loli so no.</br>  <br>The 3 of them are straight though.</br>  <br>I ned to see more Maria and Tsubasa before making such an important decision.</br>  <br>I want hibiki to go berserk.</br>  <br> no kanade x tsubasa <br>TRASH.</br></br>  <br>Miku. If she loses her memories of Hibiki does that count at NTR?</br>  <br> Miku loses ehr memories of Hibiki <br> she goes full Casca on her <br>Yes pls</br></br></br>  <br> commie <br> translators  <br><br>It's called an educated guess</br></br></br></br>  <br>Girls can't love  ashes </br>    <br>damn this image is a blast from the past</br>  <br> stawpoll  <br><br>Try and control your cancer this isn't a Yahri thread.</br></br></br>  Edgy little cunt.  <br>But can they love ashes' memories in doll form?</br>  <br>I was thinking more along the lines of driving out of London and then stopping in the middle of nowhere because they ran out of gas.</br>  <br>Maria x Tsubasa<br>Chris x me</br></br>  <br>Botted as fuck.</br>  <br>It's just proxy-chan</br>  <br>I'm just going to make an assumption about the culprit and leave it at that.</br>  <br> How else will I destroy everything you hold dear? <br>Silly Carol, you don't need to fight Hibiki to do that.  Just murder Miku in front of her. </br></br>  <br>This. The only people who actively dislike Maria are militant Tsubasa x Chris shippers.</br>  Alright /a/, who is best girl?  That sounds like the sort of question that can only be answered by a COOKING CONTEST!  <br>Alice would win imo</br>  <br>Alice.</br>  <br>Can't we combine them somehow?</br>  <br>Erina, chibi Alice is fucking disgusting holy shit</br>   MFW I love them both and can't choose between them.   Alice but I don't like white hair so it's close.  <br> white </br>  <br>Alice obviously. Better body, innovative cooking and way funnier.</br>  <br>Erina without a doubt.</br>  <br> white hair <br><br>Are you colorblind?</br></br></br>  <br>Her hair is blonde.</br>  <br>Alice hands down. Erina a shit.</br>  Alice's cooking was cool. How she made stuff look like eggs and shit. Also she is hot.   GOKIGENYOU   <br><br><br>It's clearly white, you fucking colourblind faggots.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I didn't pay that much attention, I thought it was supposed to be white. It kinda looks like it in this picture.<br>http://bato.to/read/_/325643/shokug<wbr>eki-no-soma_ch121_by_casanova/3</wbr></br></br></br></br>  Episode 15 when?<br><br>Also I prefer Alice.</br></br>  <br><br>Erina is a goddess. Never compare her to plebs like Alice.</br></br>  <br>I love when she says this, don't know why..</br>  <br>Image related, it explains everything.</br>  <br>erina, alice is used goods</br>    <br>You got it backwards.</br>  Both are top tier but Alice is a bit better    Both are shit tbh    <br>well one is a fun character who radiates "interesting" and the other is a tsun. Alice wins</br>  As a filthy secondary, both are total cunts. Though I empathize with Alice a bit since growing up and having everyone fawn all over your cousin and not give a shit about you because she's a picky eater is pretty bullshit.    neither, anon  amazing  <br> Ask for Best Girl <br> Look at the fucking choices <br> Left: A Shit <br> Right: Autist <br><br><br>Wat?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice is at least pretty cute.</br>  <br>Are you saying autism is bad?</br>  <br>Where do you think you are?</br>  <br>Not an anonymous meeting place for Autists?</br>  <br>Wrong answer, try again.</br>  <br>I can't. Apparently I'm in the wrong place.<br>I guess I'll try /jp/.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Pic related.<br><br><br>You can also try /lgbt/.<br>There are more retards than autists over there, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one with longer hair is always best girl.<br><br>Short hair bitches are disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>Top hair or bottom hair?</br>  <br>Excellent taste.</br>  personality - alice<br>looks - erina<br>jobber status - erina</br></br>  <br> jobber status - erina <br>The only jobber from those two is Alice.</br></br>  <br>erina barely jobs to mc he just occasionally rocks her on her high horse</br>  <br> erina <br> not literally autistic </br></br>  <br>Oh Gods, who did that?<br>Oh shit. What the fuck were they thinking?<br><br>Here. Please overwrite your image. I urge you. Do not keep that ridiculous fuck-up.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he's this insecure </br>  It's Erina tbh  <br> he likes men </br>  <br>Are you saying I'm a girl?</br>  <br>Erina, I like Alice but there's something off with her.</br>  Left  I like Alice<br><br> But Erina is obviously best Nakiri </br></br>  <br>Muh nigga.</br>  Alice, obviously  Alive obviously     Implying Soma isn't best    N I K U  <br>niku</br>  <br>Obviously</br>  <br>Alice, definitely.</br>  <br>M I T O I K U M I<br><br>I<br><br>T<br><br>O<br><br>I<br><br>K<br><br>U<br><br>M<br><br>I</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You only like her because she dresses like a hooker.</br>  <br>I'll take her as a side dish.</br>  <br> not realising how cute Ikumi actually is <br> not being able to see past Ikumi's style (which is an obvious coping mechanism/sort of rebllion for not being able to act feminine as a child) <br> being this stupid </br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br> nikufags trying to justify their love over the show's main fap fuel </br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>I'm an Erinafag, but I like Ikumi and can see her for what she is.<br><br>You have some underlying problems if the only thing you can think about when it comes to Ikumi sexualising her.<br><br>Especially after all the times where she's talked about finally being able to do feminine things or complaining about her being restricted from being feminine as a child.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 taste.</br>  <br>Stop trying to read between the line, she is wearing whore clothes cause she is one, if she wanted to be feminine she'd were dress, cmon she is not an autist, she is just here for sexual relief.</br>  Alice. I fucking hate Erina's attitude, holy shit. She needs to be served.  <br> being dumb enough to believe the author's excuse for having a fap fuel in the story </br>  <br>I like her because she's delicious brown.</br>  <br>i've love to serve her if you know what i mean</br>  <br> Alice would win <br> cooking contest <br> she cant even beat her own assistant all the time <br> her assistant got a better position in the fall elections <br><br>Anon i fucking love Alice, and she IS in the top 5 of the first year students , but Erina IS the number one , and there is a pretty big gap between her the the rest of the top 5 who are all pretty much at the same level, that gap will get smaller as time goes on but i doubt Alice will ever really beat Erina is a straight up cook off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No reason to choose brother, just enjoy all them superior Nakiri genes.</br>  <br> reading between the lines <br><br>I simply reiterated what was presented in the manga.<br><br>She wore a dress in the drama cd and wouldn't shut up about how she could finally be feminine and how she couldn't wait to ballroom dance with Souma with ballroom dancing was the only feminine act she could partake in as a kid.<br><br>You lack serious comprehension skills and straight up common sense if you can't see she dresses in an overtly feminine way, as a sort of vindictive measure as to being raised to be "strong" etc.<br><br>Anyway, before I start sounding like a tumblrina or an SJW trying to tell you why your interpretation of Ikumi's character is off I'll just say one thing<br><br>Stop thinking with your dick all the time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She, like her mother, is albinos</br>  <br> Stop thinking with your dick all the time <br>An Ikumifag telling me that<br><br>Top kek.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally said I'm an Erinafag like 3 posts above</br>  <br>That's actually what you are doing, you are trying to push this "I want to be a grill" on Nikumi while she just want to dress up slutty because the author just want her to receive shitload of cum, no matter what you think she is here to please the eyes of pervert and that's all.<br><br><br>He said he was an erinafag though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother replying to him.</br>  So what did you animeonlyfags think about the reveal of the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi?  I want to fuck the one on the right.  I think it might have been more enjoyable if you guys didn't spoil it.  <br>That they're just really chuuni?</br>  <br> I wish </br>  <br>Kurumi is for hugging.</br>  <br> the reveal </br>  Is there more fanart of the right one? I need it!  <br><br>Best girl order</br></br>  <br>Eighteen year olds.</br>  <br> waroting </br>  <br>1. Look up her name in Cambodian liturgical script.<br>2. Go on Pixiv, enter her name in the search box, and have at it.</br></br>  <br>Thats too much work anon. Please do it for me.</br>  <br>This. Worst part is sourcefags spoiled it in threads unrelated to the show and in the most obnoxious ways possible.</br>    <br><br>Your own fault for having even an ounce of expectation about anon and coming onto /a/.<br>You should have stayed off of /a/ completely.</br></br></br>  <br>there's nothing wrong with being inconsiderate to animeonlyfags</br>  <br>(different anon)<br>Your point is 100% valid, however spoilage is an inevitable fact on /a/. It shouldn't happen, but it does anyway. This is why I at least avoid a topic's threads if I at all care about getting spoiled.<br><br/></br></br></br>    <br>Impeccable  display of shit taste </br>  It looks hella generic. I won't watch it.  <br>I bet you think the crazy bitch is the best girl. Go away bear lover.</br>  <br>3/2/4/1</br>    <br> It looks hella generic. <br>Thats the point. Without spoiling why its supposed to look generic.<br> I won't watch it. <br>Its only 20 minutes friend, give it a go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I read as far as the  shopping mall  a few months ago.<br>I don't think they hid the reveal much, I mean didn't they mention it in descriptions?</br></br>  <br>the correct order is 4 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 2</br>  <br>This is acceptable<br><br>This is not</br></br></br>  <br>Fixed that for you mate</br>  <br>Shovel and Garter are interchangeable for first and second place, but cathat is always 3rd, and titty onee-san is always last.</br>  <br>I meant those as rankings from left to right.</br>  I was looking forward to the reaction of animefags. But then idiots started spamming "le pretending to not know meme" and turned the threads into shitposting central.  So was the part before the TWIST! just to catch the audience off-guard or is the whole "what's-her-face escaping from reality" thing just a gimmick and will the rest be like most of the first episode under the guise of playing along with her delusions?  <br><br>I don't know what to think of it to be honest. Like, I can't tell where they're going with it. I'll be honest I was spoiled by some of you. Is Pink insane and we're supposed to be viewing this from her perspective, or can they all really not tell the difference between themselves and the undead?</br></br>  Yo hold on I just joined these threads and thought this was a cutesy slice of life generic thing from the pictures.  Then I noticed the shovel.   What exactly is going on?   <br> Is Pink insane and we're supposed to be viewing this from her perspective <br>This<br><br>This, its a shame because I fucking love seeing reactions to shit like shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga/watch the first episode before you get spoiled. Don't come back to any gakkou gurashi threads until then.</br>  <br>leave this thread immediately and download it now</br>  <br>Tabbed and watching it right now.</br>  <br>Shit taste.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out RIGHT now<br><br>Watch the first episode</br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy the SOL of the season</br>  Daily reminder that:<br> &gt;Yuki is slowing recovering from her delusional fiasco <br> Rii is becoming delusional  <br> Miki is starting to show anxiety disorder  <br> Kurumi is dying and suicide flags </br></br></br> <br><br>We're going to see a dead girl pretty soon. Prepare yourselves.</br></br></br>  <br> Liking TitsMcGee <br> Liking   the girl to give up hope the fastest <br>Bears go away</br></br></br>  She knows.  <br> So what did you animeonlyfags think about the reveal of the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi? <br>I've wanted a  deconstruction  of the SoL genre for a while now, and I'm glad I got what I wanted.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uS7<wbr>8f4WUbXs</wbr>  [ ]<br>This video pretty much sums it up</br></br>  <br>You mean SoD</br>  <br>She's a member of the gardening club. It's explained in the first episode.</br>  <br>Shovel is without a doubt best but I want to fuck a broken Rii-chan's tits.</br>  <br> your opinion and taste </br>  <br>she has a good bad habit of leaving and then sticking around to ease-drop</br>  SO what's the deal with radio-chan? how the fuck did she get infected inside that bunker? and if she was on meds and they stopped working how come kurumi ins't turning back into a zombie?  Why would they set up camp in a school of all places? Seems like a terrible decision if staying alive is their goal.  <br>Why would you ever like  the most mentally weak girl? </br>  <br>She was probably infected before she locked herself in the bunker. And it's possible she was infected for a lot longer than Kurumi has been so far.<br><br>It's also possible that Kurumi is super special half-dead now who can't be infected but isn't quite alive either but that's just me making up things because I don't want her to die.</br></br></br>  <br>I like who's the best.</br>  <br>The school has solar power and still has resources.</br>  <br>She's sexy, has big boobs and broken girls are fucking hot. It's not that hard to understand.</br>  <br>The outbreak happened while they were at school (note Sakura sensei is with them). So it's no wonder they got stuck in the school and barricade themselves from those flesh eaters.</br>  Made me marathon the manga, what a ride, liking it so far.  <br>That would make sense with fast zombies but we already saw how slowly these zombies move. It would take at least 20 days for them to actually outnumber native Japanese.</br>  <br>Everyone except Kurumi and Miki were on the roof when the outbreak happened. It was easier to just barricade themselves on the higher floors than to take the risk of escaping, especially since they had supplies. Megu-nee probably also knew about the shelter after reading the instructions so she talked them into staying there.<br><br>Also, Yuki was visibly breaking down so Megu-nee came up with the idea of pretending they were a club doing club activities to help Yuki cope.</br></br></br>  <br>forgot the bear ears</br>  <br> The school was actually prepared for such a situation. They are able to have electricity/take baths due to solar power, there's a school shop which has plenty of supplies including toiletries, and although the girls don't know this at the start there's also a bomb shelter in the basement with plenty of food. </br>  <br>my nig</br>  Is it bimonthly?

Like a testing grounds of some kind. They were probably working for some drug, and something went wrong, leading to the events right now. </br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4893979<br>Only one way to solve this problem</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't understand why the helicopter pilot killed himself like that.  <br>I can name a few reasons why it's good to throw away the gun.<br>1. Ammo<br>2. Too dangerous<br>3. You can kill zombies with melee weapons anyway</br></br></br></br>  <br> tights + swimsuit <br>Hnnnng</br></br>  I don't want to be one of those autists that complain about realism or whatever but the part where they strap the solar panel on the roof of the car is crazy how would they know how to wire a car to run on that solar panel? is it even possible?  Garter &gt; Twintails &gt; Neko Hat &gt; Long hair  <br>Yuki is actually the best, start from there.</br>  <br>My memory is going full retard but which chapter did they show the use of solar panel?</br>  <br>I was hoping they keep it for protection vs other survivors esp male ones, imo the zombies aren't all that dangerous if a high school girl can take care of multiple ones by herself <br><br>I guess the biggest argument against is the girl's mental state but I wanted miki to have kept it so far she is the most solid</br></br></br>  <br>He got a seizure. He first looks at the postcard they found from the girls but crumples it by making a fist. His hand is shaking when he reaches into the bag, and the girls that the helo is shaking too much. When he gets the syringe in his hand, he makes another fist which destroys the content.</br>  <br> &gt;also anyone think they fucked up big time throwing that gun away? <br>It really was just useless in their hands. They'd never be able to land headshots, the sound would only attract more zombies, and having the gun around just encourages the girls to commit suicide. <br><br>The suicide thing is why they threw it away in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think the car is being solar powered, they're just carrying the solar panel with them.</br></br>  <br>Guns are a detriment during a zombie apocalypse. A bow and arrow would be much more practical.</br>  <br>I see, thanks.</br>  <br><br> I would never go through all that trouble. It's just gonna make it more painful when the truth hits her.</br></br>  <br>I thought he got infected. They were handling the items at the facility with gloves and whatnot but something might have been contaminated all the same.</br>  <br>I wanna say around 26 maybe just off the top of my head, you know after their "graduation" and they set out for the university the car they are driving has a massive solar panel on the roof of it, I distinctly remember a overhead shot showing the panel and they talk about it prior to leaving as well, they swap it for radio-chan's rv soon</br>  <br> I don't understand why the helicopter pilot killed himself like that. <br>Seriously? That what you think happened? Are you completely unable to read what happens in scenes that don't flat out tell you with text?</br></br>  <br>Some anon said he was infected instead.</br>  <br>the heli crash scene was not done well 1st time thru I didn't even realize how badly the school and roof got fucked up untill after they go back in</br>  <br>Megu-nee felt like it backfired horribly when Yuki started believing her own fantasy, but in the end she became stronger for it once she did manage to face the truth somewhat.<br><br>They mention that she's been very competent and capable lately even though she still keeps the act up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>OHHHHHHHHHHHH SHIT IMA PICK THIS UP THO. WHAT STUDIO MADE THIS GAT DANG  are the rest of them figments of her imagination, or are they all real survivors and shes just crazy about the rest of the students? </br></br>  <br>No shit<br><br>What do you think caused his seizure?</br></br></br>  <br>The rest of the girls are real  except the teacher. </br>  <br>rest of them are alive bruh aldoe in the manga the dog is ded and unded</br>  <br>She took it just fine</br>  <br>ahh right can't believe I didn't put that together makes sense now</br>  <br>I thought that you fags spammed it so much so everyone already knew about that "reveal". Then again, if I didn't know I probably wouldn't even have watched it.<br><br><br>Right, I have noticed that /a/ can only ruin your enjoyment of the shows with spoilers, trolling, shitposting, shit taste and god knows what else. I have no idea why I still come to this shithole.</br></br></br></br>  <br> being infected cause you to have a seizure <br>What?</br></br>  <br> I'm too stupid to understand whats going on <br> THIS MEANS THE SCENE WASN'T WELL DONE! </br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/leddit/</br>  <br>he's in the process of turning did you read the note radio chan left she had a sezuire that caused her writing to get all wonky at the end of the note too</br>  <br>She calms down after cleaning up the classroom and finding the album they made.</br>  If only the girls had had the good fortune to be born in America instead of Japan, so there would have been easy access to guns.  <br>Do you think you just RANDOMLY turn just like that? It's still a disease.</br>  <br><br><br>Is English your second language? Do you not read a lot or something? Must everything be spoonfed to you?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure she is just having a nightmare.<br><br>Not that we know the symptoms of long-term medication of the infected.</br></br></br>  <br>They had that survival guide software from the  underground shelter. </br>  The way things are looking, Madoka will be the anime of the decade.<br><br>Is /a/ alright with this?</br></br>  Most people already got over it and the lack of sequels isn't doing it any favors.  I don't know, anyone have any other suggestions for anime of the decade?  <br>Rail Wars</br>  <br>Steins;Gate</br>  <br>Girls und Panzer</br>  <br><br>Gundam Unicorn</br></br>   Rebellion is the anime of the decade <br>Is not like it was bad so it's okay.</br>  <br>It's mid 2015 and there hasn't been anything as good in the first half and I'm not excited for anything currently planned.</br>  <br>Princess Kaguya</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>the only halfway serious on in there is s;g</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, fine in my book.<br><br>Homu did nothing wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody expected Madoka to get as big as it did either. You really don't know what to expect from original anime unless the staff has glaring problems.</br>  Holy shit, you faggots should kill yourselves.  <br>AOTD<br> ass of the decade </br></br>  <br>don't lose your head over it</br>  <br>easily the least serious of the suggestions</br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  Not even AOTY 2011<br><br> Penguindrum was. <br> 1v1 me fag i dare u </br></br></br>  Didnt Madoka basically invent anime?  <br> dull, forgettable characters <br> meh production values <br> rushed pacing <br> shock value <br> Yuki Kajiura <br><br>Nah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinsekai Yori</br>  It wasn't even that good. I really don't get why everyone thinks it's some kind of masterpiece.  Not really. Evangelion 4.44 will probably sweep the decade.<br><br>However, exclusively talking about TV anime then yeah. Although there's some Yuasa's work that could easily compete.</br></br>  <br>Haven't watched it since the first time i did i guess it's pretty forgetable to me.</br>  <br>This, Ping Pong and Tatami &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Madoka</br>  <br>Sure, it's a masterpiece. There's years to go, but I'd still be happy if nothing managed to top it.</br>  <br>Evangelion is shit.</br>  NEETs can't stand it because gen uro is their sworn enemy..  <br> 4.44 <br>It's 3.0+1.0, get in with the time</br></br>  <br>K-On!! and most of the Monogatari series are my picks. Madoka is close, though.</br>  <br>Well, Rebuild is shit, Evangelion was pretty good.</br>  <br> steins gate is bad because its socially acceptable and deprecated the VN, an ultra-otaku medium <br>Every time</br></br>  <br><br>Then imagine what would that said about Madoka.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear</br>  <br>It wasn't even AOTY in 2011, let alone will be anime of the decade.</br>  <br> K-On!! and most of the Monogatari series <br>tip top kek</br></br>  That's perfectly fine.  I definitely don't mind it.  <br>Sora no Woto, Katanagatari, Tatami Galaxy, Nichijou, Steins;Gate, Usagi Drop, Penguindrum, Hyouka, Jinrui, Psycho ass season 1 only, Uchouten Kazoku, Kyousougiga, all the new mushishi stuff, Ping Pong, Shirobako, Death Parade, Kekkai Sensen<br><br>Were all as good as (if not better than) Madoka</br></br></br>  <br>Do people seriously believe Madoka is in any way whatsoever well written?<br><br>I'm not saying it's shit (Shinbo and Kaijura save it), but it is definitely not great.</br></br></br>  <br><br> penguinfag still mad his "underrated gem" is residing in the dustbin of anime history where it belongs </br></br>  <br>Symphogear S1</br>  <br> Nichijou <br> good <br>animation quality can't save an unfunny comedy</br></br></br>  <br>It is well-written.</br>  <br><br> sora no woto <br> Penguindrum <br> Usagi Drop <br> Hyouka <br> Uchouten Kazoku <br> psycho pass <br> Death Parade <br> Kekkai Sensen <br> Ping Pong </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> good animation can't save animation <br><br>sure it can.</br></br></br>  <br>Bikini Warriors.</br>  Threads like this is why Admins rangebanned phones on /a/  <br>stop posting this in every thread you sperg</br>  <br>You wish it were bait. It'd be less embarrassing if it were bait. That is one-hundred percent earnest.</br>  <br> Uchouten Kazoku <br> Kyousougiga <br> Death Parade <br> Kekkai Sensen <br>you can't be fucking serious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can understand why you'd think that, but I don't overrate Madoka which is why the list consists of a whole bunch of 8's and even couple 7's. I'm honestly surprised S;G isn't in your list as well. It's definitely not THE standout anime out of that list.</br>   4 and a half years later <br> still have regular threads full of butthurt faggots debating Madoka's GOAT status <br>Sounds like anime of the decade to me.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying it's poorly written?</br>  <br>I'm just one guy and my honest opinion on this is that's it fucking stupid from start to finish. I was not entertained so there you have it.</br>  <br><br>Could have at least thrown in a few serious suggestions. I mean Ping Pong?, Hyouka?, Kekkai? seriously?</br></br>  <br><br>You must really hate Madoka to think all of that garbage is better than it.</br></br>  Well, yeah. There is really no contest.<br><br>But the question is : should Rebellion be considered canon or just retarded cashcow everyone should ignore?</br></br>  <br>Ping Pong and Hyouka are good, not better than Madoka, but good. Kekkai being on there is just fucking disgusting.</br>  <br><br> still have regular threads full of butthurt faggots debating Madoka's GOAT status <br><br>Just like Eva, the GOAT series of its decade.</br></br></br></br>  <br> fans determine what's canon <br>I bet you also hate rebuild.</br></br>  <br>I don't hate it, it's definitely a good show. You seem to be thinking I have some agenda against it, or think that all of those shows are supposed to be AOTD material. I'm just saying they're at least as good as Madoka.</br>  <br>It was shit.<br>Faustian themes were overused back in the 50's<br>It also created an incurable cancer in the mahou shoujo genre<br><br>If all the fans of this shat were sent to the gas chambers the anime community would be better</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rebellion isn't just milking the series because it does have integrity: the way it pissed everybody off is proof of that. It looks at the ending of the series and says, no, Homura wouldn't have done that, and I think it's a valid take on the character.</br>  <br> I bet you also hate rebuild. <br>Anyone with taste does</br></br>  Objective anime of the decade is Mushishi Zoku Shou.  <br>The thing about sequels after a conclusive ending is you're pretty much free to ignore them. We already have the ending they originally intended, so anything new is canonical but pretty much just acts as an alternative for those who want more. It's not quite like series that are intended to be longer from the start. <br><br>That doesn't make Rebellion somehow not canon, but you can still enjoy the series as it's own stand alone work without having to enjoy Rebellion and Rebellion doesn't really effect the quality of the series.</br></br></br>  GOAT huh?  <br>If anything, Rebellion cemented Madoka's status as AotD. It took the original ending and flipped it on its head in a way that was both totally predictable and shocking, and revealed a new way to look at its most iconic character,</br>  <br> Objective <br>I love this meme</br></br>  <br>of the decade you sperg</br>  Either Penguindrum or Yuri Kuma.  <br> Rebellion doesn't really effect the quality of the series. <br>But it does.<br>It completely ruins it.</br></br></br>  <br> Faustian themes were overused back in the 50's <br><br>You mean 1850s, right?</br></br></br>  <br> I'm just saying they're at least as good as Madoka. <br>But they're not. Most of them, sure, but really if you really think shit like Death Parade and Pelosi Sensen belongs on that list, your taste is fucking shit.</br></br>  <br> Huouka <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Whoever believes Homura wouldn't behave like that at the ending has been reading too much doujinshi and fanworks and letting it cloud the way they view Homura as a character.<br>Homura would do anything to save Madoka, even kill Madoka's best friend (as she tried to kill Sayaka earlier) or betray Madoka herself. Stop reading doujinshi and accept canon character motivations.</br></br>  <br> sword art online </br>  <br>depending on how kekkai can be on that list, depending on how it wraps up. I'll give you Death Parade, it probably shouldn't be on the list<br><br><br>Sorry for your horrible taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Penguindrum. Madoka is pretty important and will be remembered for a long time and will probably eventually, if it isn't already, be to magical girl series what EVA is to super robot series. But I think it needs proper conclusion to reach that point, since rebellion ended on a cliffhanger.<br><br>But as a creative work, Penguindrum has a much broader scope and engages far more emotions than than Madoka. It didn't even need to play off a genre to say something interesting about the human condition.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't usually rate with numbers, but Madoka is just okay-tier to me which would probably translate to a 6.<br><br>Tatami Galaxy, Hanasaku Iroha, Penguindrum, Mushishi, Hyouka, Ping Pong, Kyousougiga, Euphonium, Yamatao 2199, Uchouten Kazoku, The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, and Kaguya-hime are better.</br></br></br>  <br>No it doesn't. That's like saying the prequels completely ruin the original Star Wars trilogy. Or Jurrasic Park 3 completely ruins the original. The series exists on its own and Rebellion is supplementary to it. If you're unable to enjoy the original because of a bad sequel, especially when Rebellion isn't even bad, then that's your own problem really.</br>  <br><br> Yurikuma <br><br>I didn't exactly dislike YK, but please don't mention it in the same breath and Penguindrum (or Utena for that matter). It is by far Ikuhara's weakest work.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hanasaku Iroha <br>It's time to stop.</br></br>  <br>I don't think I'll ever get Hyouka. For what it's worth, I'm fine with it having a "Most Improved" award because it saved an awful first half with a much better second half, but I still don't think it was any good. There were so many annoying things and I think the clumsy writing and direction whenever it came to the gay best friend exemplifies that.</br>  <br>Doesn't GOAT mean Greatest Of All Time, not<br>Greatest Of the Decade?</br></br>  <br>Utena &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; YKA &gt; Penguindrum</br>  <br>It has a top tier level of animation and a competent level of interesting cinematography, which is more than can be said for most anime coming out in the last 5-10 years that aren't movies or shorts.</br>  It honestly doesn't matter what you personally think of Madoka. I know people who think Eva is a pretentious piece of shit but does that make it not the definitive anime of the 90s? Fact is Madoka has made a bigger splash on the medium than any other anime of the decade.  <br>Kon for best of decade? Fuck off cheesedick</br>  <br>Pretty much</br>  <br>I don't respect that at all, and the cinematography was one of my complaints because it kept hitting the wrong tone. Animation quality is just barely a notch above special effects. It's boring if not in service of a good story, and I don't respect Hyouka's story.</br>  <br>Nichijou and Barakamon.</br>  <br><br>It's more like <br><br>Penguindrum &gt; Utena &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;YKA</br></br></br></br>  <br> Fact is Madoka has made a bigger splash on the medium than any other anime of the decade. <br><br>Unfortunately I have to agree with this. I will criticize it to hell and back, but it would be intellectually dishonest of me to deny or outright ignore what it did to the anime community at large.</br></br></br>  <br>name one relevant anime that drew on madoka for inspiration</br>  <br>Slapstick, shitty cg, and overall shit better than madoka? Reconsider your life choices dicktickler</br>  <br><br> Penguinshit <br><br>Even Steins;Gate made a greater impact.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My condolences for your shit taste. It must be terrible to watch a visual medium about animation for the story and not being able to appreciate what differentiates it from other mediums when it's done well.</br>  <br>Yuuki Yuuna</br>  <br>Genei</br>  <br>WIXOSS</br>  <br><br>relevant, please</br></br>  <br>Neon Genesis Evangelion</br>  <br>Define "relevant"</br>  <br><br>Penguindrum was shit. It'd be better if it made sense, got rid of the apple shit, and had more girls with animal hats, maybe focusing on girls with animal hats fighting each other. Basically, it'd be better if it were more like Madoka.</br></br>  <br>are you illiterate?</br>  <br>You mean mushi-shit holy shit something else to put me to sleep? Nah lates dawg</br>  <br>Sora no Woto, Katanagatari, Tatami Galaxy, Penguindrum, Jinrui, and Psycho Pass may have been better than Madoka but no way in heck did they have the same influence Madoka did. <br><br>Death Parade and Kekkai Sensen were/are flawed.</br></br></br>  <br> Basically, it'd be better if it were more like Madoka <br>I like the way you think.</br></br>  <br>I personally do not believe it is well written but that is just my opinion.</br>  <br><br>Utena &gt;&gt;&gt; Penguindrum &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; YKA</br></br>  <br>It's amazing how you can be pretentious and uppity about being a simplistic retard who only cares about pretty pictures.</br>  <br> Death Parade and Kekkai Sensen were/are flawed. <br>That's an understatement.</br></br>  <br>No. Series made it clear that Homura would rather die than hurting Madoka in any way.<br><br><br>Yes, it changes how people see the characters and they apply this changed viewpoints on the prequel, changing it.</br></br></br></br>  SSY was objectively better at what madoka tried to do, which mostly survives by yuri pandering.<br><br>In my opinion, fate zero, hyouka, spice and wolf, and others were a lot more enjoyable.</br></br>  <br>Madoka was merely the result of 10 years of neo classical stylization being brewed in Japan, one day or another an anime original to flagship it info anime was bound to exist.<br><br>Just like that, late night mahou shoujo already existed. Moe abuse too. All the thematics were already going.<br><br>I feel like Madoka didn't make a wave as big as say, Eva. But what it did was to make people realize that the wave was there</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I second this post</br>  <br>Says the anon who watches cartoons for the story.</br>  <br> exclusively lists sleeper shows <br>I dont think so bro</br></br>  <br>I mean, relevant is a completely subjective term, I may find something relevant that you don't, and vice-versa.

So Fuck off.</br>  <br><br> fateshit <br><br>Why did you even bother clicking the post button?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you too bitch</br>  <br>you're the one claiming that madoka had some profound impact on the industry and cannot provide an example of this<br><br>stop attacking my words and start backing up your own claims you stupid newfag sperg</br></br></br>  <br><br> How to spot a Penguinfag </br></br>  <br>Is this really necessary? Relevant (by your definition) anime that drew on Madoka for inspriation automatically qualifies Madoka as being anime of the decade? No. Madoka is being considered anime of the decade for far FAR more than just that. <br><br>There are plenty of anime that drew on Evangelion for inspriation, and how many of those are "relevant" and made waves in the anime industry? I can think of plenty that sucked and plenty that were popular but nothing that gained as much of a following as Evangelion - at least from what I watched in the past.</br></br></br>  <br>How can a Madoka fan hate fate? It's the same shit and the creator are having gay sex from what we know</br>  <br>Lain and FLCL for starters</br>  We still have almost half a decade left and you think you can crown yet another mahou shoujo as AOTD?  <br>That wasn't me. I was the one who made the post . I didn't attack you at all or make any of the suggestions that others posted. Besides, you make it sound as if I am the only one in the thread that made the claim.</br>  <br>I'm not that guy, but anyway, I never claimed that Madoka had any sort of impact. You asked for examples of things inspired by it, and I gave one. I don't see why you're getting so upset over it.</br>  <br>You're the one who says people's examples don't count for some arbitrary reason you refuse to explain</br>  <br>Kevin Spacey.</br>  <br>Yes madoka a best idyot</br>  <br>Thank you. I stand corrected then.</br>  Examples of Madoka's impact on industry<br> it is references in many other anime or games <br> it spawned quite a few "ripoffs" (Gen'ei, YuYuYu) <br> it catapulted Urobuchi from niche writer into superstar where people watch anime just because there is his name attached to it <br> it fucked up release of Kizumonogatari </br></br></br></br>  <br>Urobuchi is already popular before Madoka</br>  <br>Most people initially were hyped for Madoka just because Urobuchi was attached to it dude.</br>  <br>No you dont stupidass.

The only real fault I can give it is it isn't exactly KyoAni-level production value. 9.5/10 seems fair. There isn't a 10/10 anime IMO, although if KyoAni had made the Origination, that'd probably be it.<br><br>I don't think you understand how the SoL genre works.

It's getting more material to this day and a second season is all but guaranteed.<br><br>WIXOSS also has a card game and is getting more material constantly.</br></br></br>  What the hell are you talking about.<br>there's still four and a half years for the decade and nothing is even worth looking at as the anime of the decade.<br>Anime a shit</br></br>  <br>I don't think he understands relevant is relative. Relevant to what? The history of anime and the medium as a whole? The last few years? Relevant to the west?</br>  <br>Wixoss is the only one you've mentioned that has anything to do with madoka.</br>  <br>I'd say that YuYuYu definitely has some Madoka influence, if only because I think that it would be really hard to make a non-Precure mahou shoujo that doesn't have Madoka influence. The people calling it a ripoff are retards who haven't actually watched the show, though.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>What I want to know is when is the sequel since there is no way this gravy train ends at that movie.</br>  <br>Your generic slice of lifes will never be the anything but the delusions in your head of them being good.</br>  <br> labeling exceptional SoL anime as generic, thereby implying that all SoL anime are generic <br>Might as well throw the word "moeshit" in there while you're shitposting.</br></br>  <br>You know what, whatever we think wouldn't matter to normalfags. Anime of the year would always be some mainstream bullshit like naruto, bleach, etc</br>  So is this shitpost general then?  <br>...and whatever normalfags think wouldn't matter to us. Your point?</br>    <br> &gt;&gt;/something awful/ </br>  I'm alright with that  By what standards you'd even decide that? You may be able to say if a show is objectively good, but how do you even compare 2 good shows in different genres? <br>Take for instance SnW and HxH, I'm sure most people here agree that they're both good, but you can't say which one is better, you can only tell which one you enjoyed more and that's based on taste and purely subjective.</br>  <br>The Wind Rises</br>  <br> Precure is the only MS before madoka <br>You are dumb.</br></br>  <br>based on rebellion she would have to be the fuck up of the decade</br>  <br>Why would a show that aired before Madoka have Madoka influence?</br>  <br> Madoka <br> AOTD <br><br>...I'm okay with it...</br></br></br></br>  What is the anime of the 00 years?  <br>Aria.</br>  <br>Diebuster<br> Also Diebuster &gt; Gunbuster </br></br>  <br>I'm saying it's stupid to argue YuYuYu had madoka influence simply because it isn't Precure and is a mahou shoujo. Straight up retarded, but this is pretty typical of people whose first MS was madoka.<br><br>It's using circular logic. Madoka is relevant because it influenced shows. What shows? This one. But that isn't influenced by madoka. It is because any MS besides Precure is influenced by madoka. Why? Because it's relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>Rebellion was the first time she actually managed to do something she wanted to rather than fucking up and failing, though.</br>  <br> Usagi Drop <br> Penguindrum <br> Nichijou <br> STEINS;GATE <br> PSYCHO SHIT  <br> DEATH FUCKING PARADE <br> KEK FUCKING KAI FUCKING SENSEN <br><br>ayyy lmao</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ... <br>Kill yourself, faggot.</br></br>  <br> this mad </br>  Probably, actually.    <br>Okay, let me list a few ways:<br> character design <br> sets up a cute atmosphere before revealing its true nature <br> Faustian bargians <br> Senpai character who encourages everyone to become meguca goes insane after learning the truth </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i have seen people sperg over this a lot of times <br>but never when i've used it <br>what is up with that?</br></br></br>  <br>First season of psycho pass was way better than madoka.</br>  <br>Going as a whole for multi-season franchises, including OVAs and/or movies, ARIA.<br>Runner up:  Haruhi </br></br>  <br>I liked it better when it was called Getter Robo.</br>  5 years later and its still well remembered here I guess that should mean something.  <br>No, it wasn't.</br>    <br>you think that tired old insult is going to work 8 years later?</br>  <br><br>If we're being serious and not just naming off our favorites, it'd probably be K-on or Madoka, at this point.

Madoka design is a lot more like hidamari, while YuYuYu is extremely generic.<br><br> sets up a cute atmosphere before getting dark <br>Plenty of shows did that. Lyrical girl nanoha is a mahou shoujo infamous for that. Not only that, but for a while the show still maintains a focus on every day life well into the series. Only at episode 8 does it really completely abandon the SoL aspect, while madoka drops it by the third.<br><br> bargains <br>Devil deals/Monkey paws are not all the same as Faustian bargains.

It was well received by Critics. It is one of the top selling anime ever.

Damn, I really feel sorry for the MC. Getting fucked over pretty hard there. A normal person would get depressed after after what happend to him. Since everything he has been working for, HAS GONE TO SHIT.  <br>It's the exact same video you retard.</br>  <br>Explain further. I truly want to know wether you are just shitposting or I'm missing something huge.</br>  <br>Not him, but in this case you're the retarded one. <br><br>What do you think HorribleSubs rips from Crunchyroll? What do you think it is? <br><br>It's the same video and audio that gets served to streamers on CR's site.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Retard.</br>  <br>Its possible her memories were altered as well. I have a feeling that Nao and MC are connected somehow.</br>  <br>They probably just released him and put him in a mental hospital when his powers faded since he's incapable of telling anyone what they did. It's not like they can just kill him even though they're EVUL.</br>  <br>Why don't we just all worship some higher being than us?</br>  <br>What is the fucking point of these? Why do you keep making these for every episode of every series? It makes no fucking sense.</br>   you call Nao cute   <br><br><br><br>That whole scene of the student council room is the definition of forced animation.

If you really can't see what's the difference between streaming and watching normally, then it still stands that you're a retard.</br>  <br>It's called autism.</br>  <br>Not him, but it's still a stream rip with no encoding at all. It looks better in 10bit, not to mention using banding removal/smooth motion etc. on it is the whole point of downloading it.<br>If you aren't going to use filters to improve the video, it will look exactly the same as watching CR video, on livestreamer in MPC.</br></br>    <br>It's for better quality but in HS's case it's the same quality.</br>  <br>The word forced is fucking stupid, just call it unnecessary like someone who dosen't just spout memes</br>  <br> She sees your   penis </br>  <br>Holy shit the camera pan around the room? That wasn't even animation. That was just an establishing shot with camera movements.</br>  <br> arguement <br>You're proving his point.</br></br>  I'm still mad at ep1. Why is Charlotte such a cunt?

It's rare seeing a glasses guy being such an idiot.  <br>That came to mind because right after we see the shot of him in the OP the scene cuts to Nao falling in shock</br>  <br>Even the cops are in it. Fucking cops. Killing people left and right. They are a gang, a plight!</br>  What's the verdict on the OP/ED?<br><br>It honestly was a little disappointing, considering the writers and vocals.<br>The OP visuals were top notch, but the song a little boring until the chorus.<br>The ED the same but the song was very stale, doesn't hold a candle to Brave Song.<br>Hopefully the OST and insert songs will be better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Lia and not Brave Song or My Soul so not AB</br>  <br>Right.

What did you think would happen?</br>  <br>Fucking stop</br>  Is it just me or did they MC just go to shit after the first episode. He had way more personality and now its just generic as fuck  <br>I don't think you understand what forced drama is supposed to mean</br>  <br> The OP music fit the scenes amazingly. <br>That it did, it had amazing synchronization with the music. It's a shame I got my hopes up from the clip in the PV, they played the chorus during it. So up until the chorus the song felt a bit slow, and not very catchy. Definitely feel like the full version may be amazing though.<br><br><br>That it did, Hope Maeda outdoes himself on them.<br><br><br>Well it was by Lia, who has been doing OPs for them since Clannad AS.

Forced Drama is their thing.</br>  <br><br>I haven't watched many key works, only Angel Beats.<br>Anohana is pretty much the only other drama that I've watched. I'm weak to this kind of stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Generally plight is used to describe the situation of the subject eg. "the plight of the citizens". You might say that "the government is deaf to the plight of its citizens", but you wouldn't say "the government is the cause of its citizens plight". The latter is technically correct but it reads awkwardly and is stylistically bad.<br><br>If the subject of the statement is the cause of the bad situation, you normally would use a different word than plight.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's absolutely not a tsundere, just pretty smug and cute character</br></br>  <br>5th webm kawaii desu!</br>  <br>Watch the two episodes and find out, you fucking idiot.</br>  <br> On /a/ and hasn't even seen Clannad <br>I don't know what to say to this</br></br>  <br>People that want forced crying and forced emotions.</br>  <br>she's a cute</br>  <br> Haraguroi girl <br> Call her a tsun. </br></br>  <br>face2wide4me</br>  <br>why would anyone even watch clannaids at this point, everyone has had it spoiled</br>  CR subs are only slightly less bad than before. I didn't notice anything that was completely incorrect like the first episode but it's just so unnatural and overly literal in a lot of parts. They also still translate 瞬間移動 as "teleportation", which makes even less sense this episode than it did in the last.  <br>No forced drama would be if something like this happened halfway through Yuruyuri.</br>  <br>Yeah, a single part in a show with like 5 distinct arcs.</br>  <br>He was just shitposting.<br>the logic is failing all over this anime.<br><br> Scientists have the goverment approval to conduct experimences but someone powerful enough just collect the ones with potential in a fucking school and now no one can do anything about it, not even the goverment itself. <br>Oh really?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I just never got around to it, always heard it was good.

This shit creeps up every time in his stories.

She didnt even get a flashback like Meiko</br></br></br>  Too bad the anime sucks  <br>there will be always someone to shitpost when you don't really need it.</br>  <br>I thought so too, but rewatching it I think the super-fast pacing works well for comedy. It's been a long time since an anime genuinely made me laugh like an idiot, and I already knew the jokes in this one. I think if they slowed the pacing it wouldn't be as funny because it would start to dwell in scenes too long.<br><br>First episode was a 9/10, 10/10 without censorship. We'll see how the rest of the series does.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally "at least she's better than shit" tier</br>  <br> I think if they slowed the pacing it wouldn't be as funny <br>Depends on how slow. Putting jokes one after the other without any pauses isn't good either.</br></br>   Did she actually enjoy getting pissed on?   <br> ______________No.____________ </br>  <br>But there were breaks. One big one was Kiyoshi talking to Chiyo in the tree, him dropping the eraser, the beginning no? Those were down times.<br><br>I really think that this is a case of too many people reading the manga. I thought it was really funny &amp; stopped at a great point. I don't agree with people dropping it or dismissing it solely, because of the fan service though. I think that's unfair.</br></br></br>   no Kate in OP or ED <br>Dropped</br>  Slut mode Chiyo is best girl  <br>I want to fuck those eyelashes.</br>  <br>They don't want to ruin the adaptation even further</br>  <br><br>With the censoring they've already done, they could never hope to animate Mari x Kate.<br><br>A shame, as I would kill to see it animated. That is the single most erotic scene in any Manga I have ever read, better then a thousand doujins.</br></br></br></br>  <br> they could never hope to animate Mari x Kate. <br> Buy the BD baka gaijin </br></br>  So I'm rereading the first couple of chapters again...and I have to say...they followed the manga's pacing pretty well. They were pretty faithful. If they slowed it down they would had to have added extra scenes (they might have done so in the beginning), but no...they kept pretty close to the original panels. <br><br>That must mean that they had a lot of respect for the story and art already and are just making it move, no? The one major fuck up is the shading though. That's about it.</br></br>  <br> That must mean that they had a lot of respect for the story and art already and are just making it move, no? <br>ofcourse<br>Prison School is a Gem, and gems must be maintained carefully<br>The anime even got quite some laughs out of me<br>If they can keep this up for another 25 episodes or so I'd call it AOTYAY</br></br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck I haven't had a good laugh in anime for a long time. Gakuto's face is fucking priceless.  Any other recommended anime like this /a/?  <br> That is the single most erotic scene in any Manga I have ever read, better then a thousand doujins. <br>This guy get's it</br></br>     Wearing each others underwear now <br>Just fuck already.</br>  <br>Kiyoshi looked hot in Hana's panties.</br>  <br><br> tfw that scene did nothing for me because I'm not gay </br></br>  <br><br>I can not wait until the anime gets to this part. The scene with the bottle is going to be amazing.</br></br>  <br>Golden Boy comes to mind</br>  <br> Hana  <br> no presence in the manga  <br><br>My kinda sir Hana is the GOAT and no female is better, yes she may have less screen/panel time then the other hoes but unlike them everytime she appears it alway mean some big is happening</br></br></br></br>  HANA IS SHIT<br><br>SHIT<br><br>KATE IS A BEST</br></br></br></br>  <br>And censoring</br>  <br>You've just named the second worst girl only being beat by the prez little sister! Leave this thread, exit off the computer, get in your car, drive to the nearest bridge and proceed to jump off</br>  <br>How do you live with such shit taste anon?<br><br>I guess that pissfag pandering Hana does really works wonders</br></br></br>  <br>It's not too bad...at the moment...</br>  So, next episode is one of the shower scenes right? Considering how many chapters are p/episode...there will definitely be one of them.  <br>Can't wait</br>  <br>I hope they don't speed through it like the others and give it enough emphasis, it's one of the best moments in the series along with Gakuto shitting himself and Andrenomics.</br>  <br><br><br> having taste this shit </br></br></br>  <br>tfw that scene did nothing for me because I'm a fag<br>fix'd that for ya bro</br></br>  <br>Episode 3 or 4 will, definitely, be the one with Shingo, but the one in episode 2 will be the first one.

Kiyoshi is a pretty lucky guy, huh? Like less than a few weeks in school and he's already got a date and another girl trying to get into his pants...  <br>Chiyo pisses me off in that she blew it off as just wanting someone to go with because her friend mayumi didnt want to. She didnt think of it as an actual date.</br>  <br><br>it's okay if you're a fag, no need to be so butthurt about it</br></br>  <br>It does make me wonder if she's, actually, going to turn it around one day and realizes that she likes him? I kinda hope not though.</br>  <br>  no u <br>very nice anon</br></br>  <br>Is summer here already?</br>  Will the anime be uncenz. in few days as day say?  <br>It doesn't go up much in the summer anon</br>  <br> Kiyoshi looked hot in Hana's panties. <br>What?<br>Was a new chapter released?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>THANK YOU</br>  <br>also check here.<br>http://yomanga.net/series/Prison-Sc<wbr>hool/chapters/183/3.php</wbr></br></br>  So, will we be revisiting Kiyoshi, the cross dresser?  <br>What does piss girl's piss taste like?</br>  <br>drinks lots of dandelion tea, so dandelions I assume.</br>  <br>Like dandelion tea, obviously.</br>  <br>Unless theres some reveal of hana/kiyoshi wearing each others underwear infront of everyone that dumbass chiyo will probably think kiyoshi is gay as fuck because she thinks the panties are gakutos. Gakuto cannot catch a break, mitsuko thinks hes a faggot too.</br>  <br>Like flowers</br>  <br>Gakuto brought it upon himself with what he did to Joe.</br>  <br>Earlier everyone thought that they were fucking each other too. Hana's not going to say anything and Kiyoshi won't say anything for Hana's sake. If he did then they'll have to get into the whole story and none of them are going to want to admit that they pissed on each other.</br>  HOW IS A MAN THAT GOT PEED ON SUPPOSED TO LIVE ON?!  GIVE ME AN ANSWER  <br>School opening ceremony scene wasn't even there</br>  <br>Well its going to come out at some point with kate knowing stuff about the two. Its probably going to be kate after losing the cavalry telling mari how she can have someone on her council that doesnt follow the illicit relationship rule.</br>  <br> scene <br><br>its 3 panels in the manga, with no lines of dialogue</br></br></br>  <br>It didn't need it. Lunchroom scene was more than enough to establish that they are the only boys at school and no one wants to talk to them.</br>  <br>I was wondering when is Hana's betrayal going to come back to her. Will it? It would be even better if Kate announced it to the entire school that someone on the USC is having an illicit relationship. Mari will think Kate is referring to them in the bath, but Hana will know that it's her.</br>  I GOT TO SAY FUCK TO A GIRL!<br><br>I'm liking the anime so far, could have been much much worse. Only real flaw is the censorship. and Gakuto's voice is off to me, and he yells too god damn much. I always read him as a calm person most of the time.</br></br>  <br> anime only <br>get the fuck out.</br></br>  <br>He yelled a lot in the beginning, once his  hair got cut   he stopped yelling as often.<br><br>Is there any info if this is going to be 2 cour or one? I think they could fit the prison escape arc nicely in 1 cour, buuuuut... It's not as bad as I expected and I think I want more. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 12 episodes. And it shows with the 5-6 chapter per epsiode pacing. It will just get quicker to rush to the ending.<br><br>Fuck I hate rushed adaptations.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There really isn't any other point in the manga that is suitable for season 1's end other than the freedom at end of volume 9. Rushed adaptation is pretty much a given.<br><br>It might not be too horrible since the manga doesn't really have a huge plot advancement/chapter ratio compared to others.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's better not to be too optimistic, nothing ever comes out from it. My hype is mostly lost, but I still hope they can surprise me.</br>  I'M TURNING INTO A FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLL<wbr>LLLLLLLLLLLL</wbr>  lol  <br> I need to see penis <br>Unless you're a woman, not liking girl on girl is extremely gay.</br></br>  <br>Wonder how well that will get animated.</br>   ch. 183 already available in burrito language <br> not in english <br>fuck is this shit</br></br>  <br> tfw yuri normally puts me to sleep but got a semi reading that scene <br>Yer a faggot Harry.</br></br>  <br>If you read the thread or use the archive you wouldnt look so retarded.</br>  <br>Hmm a pissfag or a overly obsessed bitch? Now that hard to choose from. Man Kate is weak sauce who's best redeeming factor is that she's lesbian other than that she isn't shit</br>  I want Vice President to stamp on my anus while I'm climbing through a sewage.<br><br>The life right there.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, lulu.</br>  <br>Hmm yeah for now but I don't see it getting any better</br>  Does Hiramoto Akira have the best art of all time?  <br>Get back to finishing the manga faggot</br>  <br>And best female character design.  Anzu  is a miracle of the universe, can't wait for her to appear in the anime.</br>  <br>Can you really mind fuck someone with just a kiss?</br>  <br>Fucking s uperb  taste confirmed.</br>  <br>I want Sheever to stamp on your wolf ass while your ancient is blowing up.</br>  <br>You'll never fit in Ledouche</br>  When will the crows be brought up again?  <br>First /int/, then /pol/ and now /d2g/<br><br>Are we being raided?</br></br></br>  <br>Never. They were just a disposable plot device, like Hana's karate.</br>  <br>A kiss that good that she enticed him to do it again? Sure.</br>  <br>you'd think she would have used them in the escape. Was it ever explained why risa is so strong?</br>  <br>Your fault for letting Lelouch shitting /d2g/. It doesn't help when he keep spamming "anime makes you better at Dota".</br>  <br>Never. She could use them now and direct the entire swarm to andre to win the battle,but she doesn't.</br>  <br>aren't crows kill in fire?</br>  <br>That bath scene was fucking golden</br>  <br>The censorship does suck but it also adds a layer of cheese to the profanity that I can't do without. Censoring camel toes is shit, though.<br><br>Joe easily won the episode by saying "fuck."</br></br></br>  <br>You want more filler to pad it out? Most chapters are filled with hyper detailed reaction faces and a lot of panels are dedicated to single interactions.</br>  <br>I don't want filler, I want a faithfull adaptation that follows the manga storyline without fucking it up because of time constraints.<br><br>Even if it meant the pacing was slow, that's better than rushing the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you realise the contradiction you're putting out here?</br>  I want Meiko to dominate me with her feet.  <br> faithful adaption that follows the manga storyline <br>but the first episode followed the manga literally panel for panel (except the 3 panel school assembly scene)</br></br>  <br>What contradiction? The manga doesn't have filler, the pacing never feels slow. The anime is already skipping stuff, and it feels overall really fast. There's different ways to adapt manga, and to make it in a decent way, you have to make scenes have tension and emphasis on lines or shots. The anime so far has none of that, and the direction is almost unnoticeable. <br><br>This feels like they learned how to do manga adaptations from LIDENFILMS. 1 cour anime almost never work to adapt manga unless it's a SoL or romance.<br><br><br>They skipped pages and panels, look closely. They also skipped lines. I'm not saying it was much this episode, but believe me, it will get worse. The problems with this episode were how quick everything went by. This should have ended with the sentence of prison.<br><br>And it's nothing from just one episode, next will do at least five chapters based on the PV.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aiura was a masterpiece.</br>  Can Hana just pee on my face please<br>I don't really care for the dominatrix lady and her cowtits</br>  <br>You are whining over nothing. They didn't skip over that much and what they did is not significant. What you are suggesting would mean they would have to create new content.</br>  <br>Have you ever been kissed?</br>  <br> /a/- Anime &amp; Mango <br><br>Extremely unlikely</br></br></br>  <br>No it doesn't. Ever heard of pauses,scene transition and characters not talking like they will explode if they don't speak fast enough?</br>  <br>Have you watched any other anime adaptation? There's no need to create content to have proper pacing, 5 chapters per episode is rushed no matter how you look at it. If the manga has a lot of panels, it's because it's what style and atmosphere it's trying to give, if you rush through allthe panels you are going against the idea of the manga to just tell the story. This can easily be achieved by pausing inbetween lines, having more silent moments for dramatic effect, etc. The only scene that was close to this was the one where Andre was about to lick VP's shoe, but even that was too fast. They should have left Hana's face when she got mad for more time on screen, for example. Chiyo's interactions with Kiyoshi should have been slower and calmer, they are both awkward. The examples pile up.</br>  <br>When Anime Uncensored ver. ?</br>  here the spoilers for next chapter is anyone cares  <br>Nigger, it's been translated for over a day.</br>  <br><br>What may work in manga or books may not work for tv all the time. Though the convo between him and Chiyo did happen in a short period of time but the time felt slowed down compared to other events. Overall, the anime has kinda a slapstick feel to it. <br><br>When I watched the raw I did feel that it was fast, but after having the subs I don't agree anymore. I feel that people have been whining and bitching ever since the first PV came out and I just don't agree with them. <br><br>Also, yes I have seen other adaptions or I tend to read things afterwards. If anything I do appreciate that they are not dragging things out, in particular i.e. the first episode of Classroom Crisis and Gakkou Gurashi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sauce???</br>  <br>Yeah, depends on the circumstances tho</br>  <br>Literally setting them up for another lewd scenario on the same page as hand holding intensifies ill give an arm to kiss you since the piss stuff is done.</br>  <br>Read the thread or use the archive fuckface.</br>  <br>What the cock fuck is going on there <br><br>This manga never fails to deliver shit i never expected to happen</br></br></br>  Just finished season 2 of Knights of Sidonia and absolutely loved it. Hoping for a season 3, but in the meantime I will be reading the manga from beginning to end.  I would like to hear more opinions on the anime/manga  the anime isnt really all that great once you read the manga.<br><br>Niheis art is just so fucking awesome, and the CGI is just meh.<br><br>Even the action-scenes are so much more dynamic in still-frames than in the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No S3. Flopped in Japan.</br>  <br>Well, at least we got some baller figs out of it<br>That's all I care about</br></br>  <br>Nihei's pacing is quite terrible. Anime fixed that at certain level.<br><br>The anime just lacks of horror stuffs and Imperialism Japan style uniforms.</br></br></br>  <br> 5k for a CG show <br> flopped <br>Pls anon.</br></br></br>  Who wants to buy this?  <br>I liked the manga more, but the anime is good as well. I think the haremshit is kind of overdone (more obvious in the anime) and it doesn't really add anything to the story or to the characters. With the latest developments in the manga I hope there won't be as much time for that sort of shit.</br>    Best blowfish.  <br>Did they fuck?<br>You know, the MC and the tranny.</br></br>  Why the Lightining sisters dont use magic and gunblades?  <br>...<br>fuck.</br></br>  <br> yfw tsumugi is literally a dick <br><br> Fuck why does she look sexy  , fucking warframe did this </br></br></br>  <br>Because itlooks like shes wearing a fancy dress.</br>  <br>Can she self destruct and destroy Sidonia when she reaches critical butthurt mass?</br>  <br>I am up to chapter 54 and MC and Izana didn't fuck as far as I can see</br>  <br>because.....fuck...she is my fetish now</br>    <br>Of course.</br>  <br>spoiler alert that is how the series ends</br>  S1 was superior in every single way, S2 dropped the ball but the last couple of episodes were a joy to watch.<br><br>That beautiful setting wasted on romance shenanigans, My heart bleeds.</br></br>  <br>Soo.... no?<br><br><br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; </br></br></br></br>  <br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; <br>I want summer to go and stay go</br></br>  <br>I feel with what the did in S1 and S2 they could easily wrap it up with a final season S3 <br><br><br>I'm so fucking mad about that...I just imagine it is some harem mushy stuff, but still..</br></br></br></br>  <br> he thinks summer is real <br>Confirmed new as fuck</br></br>  <br>10k first season. Why do you think they got an original ending plug in S2?</br>  <br>You are for a ride on who fucks whom.</br>  <br><br>for MANY DAYS</br></br>  <br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; <br>Confirmed new as fuck.</br></br>  <br>I didn't make that post, retard.<br>I see you haven't yet grasped the concept of anonymity.<br>Don't worry, you'll get there.</br></br></br>  Would just weaponizing the EnaJiro instead of using her to make Smoogy prevent the story from flopping like it did?  <br>Pretty much this. I still liked it though, but it could have been so much better, shit.</br>  <br>I doubt it's capable of that, in the end the incredible sturdiness of Gauna comes from their true bodies, not the placenta. If it all came down to placenta Sidonia could chuck those planet-destroying missiles at every Gauna they run across and give 0 fucks.</br>  <br>Moshi moshi?</br>    <br>I would totally watch that version of the show.<br>All space explosions all the time.<br>Probably be a shit manga though.</br></br></br>    <br>Best daki.</br>   tfw no penis waifu     <br> mfw </br>  <br>Nah, all space explosions wouldn't work for too long, I think showing the way people live when their entire civilization is on a spaceship has quite a bit of potential. My issues with the haremshit is that it doesn't fit the themes/motifs, doesn't advance the story and doesn't even really build up the characters. It's there just to be there. For instance I think the romance when Hoshijiro and Nagate were stranded fit very well with what Sidonia is about, but a lot of the other shit doesn't take advantage of the setting at all and just dilutes it in the end. There needs to be some counterbalance to the explosions and that could be SoL, but it should've been done much better.</br>    <br>Where the booze at nigga?</br>  <br>That's sound reasoning.<br>I think showing the Sidonia settling into colonization after the Gauna threat is eliminated or at least pushed back could be an interesting and setting appropriate counterbalance. But maybe I just want to see how long until the colonies would degenerate into Borderlands death worlds.</br></br>  <br>Choo choo!</br>  <br>Just got to that chapter...I vomited</br>  <br>yup..abandon ship</br>  <br>aaannnddd suddenly I don't want a S3...</br>  <br>The chapter that Smoogy is  kill  ?</br>  <br>nope...pic related</br>  TFW doing it with Tsumugi would sound like this:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9ON<wbr>7KuzCl_s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>How much advanced is the story in the manga compared to the anime? I want to start reading it but I don't know if better wait until there's more content.</br>  <br> but I don't know if better wait until there's more content. <br>you've got 75 chapters worth of content</br></br>  <br>read it, but skip chapter 63</br>  <br>Yeah, but I don't want to leave the story at the same point as the anime while waiting for new chapters<br><br><br>Now I'll have to read it to check that chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But then you wouldn't get the most out of chapter 66.</br>  <br> Smoogy is kill <br>That happens? The day is saved!</br></br>  <br>Did I miss something in chapter 66?</br>  <br>Anime is like 2/3 of the way through the current content.<br><br><br>Could be interesting as a spinoff, but a lot of the Sidonia atmosphere hangs on the desperation that inherently comes with the fact that they're always one successful Gauna attack away from being completely wiped out IMO.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're lying and you know it. The chimera scene and the scene of Kagate award ceremony lead up to (the possible) season three where Ochai plan is implement and kagate is raise onto a bigger heroic status to raise moral for the incoming war against the giant Gauna colony. Hihei liked the adaption and the studio enjoyed animating SOK. <br><br>A season three is entirely possible.</br></br></br>  <br> MANY DAYS </br>  <br>Do everyone get laid?</br>  <br>Just the MC.<br><br>not any girls, not any monsters, no... just the MC.</br></br></br>  <br> Kagate <br> Ochai <br> Hihei <br> SOK <br>what the fuck am I reading</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sidonia of Kishi, of course.

Any reason for the joint formation flight? No air friction in space. Love it tho  <br> Any reason for the joint formation flight? <br>Not explained in the manga but 2 theories floating around:<br><br>1. Some kind of Hyggs particles resonance that allows for bigger acceleration.<br>2. Guardians can't use their engines at full power alone because of stability / control issues.<br><br>These are just general ideas. Explanations with more details in archive of both /a/ and /m/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks neat. A lot of the people calling the manga hard sci-fi either don't read/watch much sci-fi or haven't thought about it too hard. It speculates about things not commonly considered but Nihei is not trying to make something as plausible as Planetes.</br>  <br>Someone mentioned the center of gravity being at the center of the circle or some shit. I know jack shit about physics.</br>  <br> no director's cut <br><br>That's wrong, both season last episode are director's cut</br></br></br>  S3 was shit. They've managed to go from a good fresh mecha to a cancer sol harem cancer. CG got worse too.   netflix <br><br>Also the show was shit<br><br> CG <br> muh space harem </br></br></br></br></br>  Needs more Samari  <br> S3 was shit.  <br>Thank you kind time traveler for revealing this.</br></br>  <br>Hasn't it sold worse than S1 though?</br>  best girl  <br>How come they couldn't give her that much more reasonable chest in the show?</br>  <br>Much worse.</br>  Why is she so  beautiful? <br><br><br>It still seems to be selling decently enough, though. It's not bad enough to rule out a third season.</br></br></br>  <br><br> fuck the clone of your crush who rejected you 100 year ago <br><br>I'm not sure I've read up to this (last I read was collecting the robot off the planet), but does he finally know that he's a clone by this stage or did some mutual attraction develop between them?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He seems aware that penis-chan is 'that girl I was into but got eaten, then a alien clone of her was found and finally mutated into a large combat space penis, who is also attracted to me'. Not sure if Tsugimi knows most of how she came to be, at least seems to know what the feelings are.</br></br>  <br> but does he finally know that he's a clone <br>She tells him right before that he's a genetically modified clone of Hiroki and that they (Kobayashi, Hiroki, Lala and Ochiai) go way back. Exactly how much she tells him isn't clear since it's just a few pages in the manga. Nagate says she "told him everything" but that's hardly reliable.</br></br>  <br><br>Arrive at desto as a group I guess?<br><br>They should be traveling huge distances, grouped together they won't land as spread out, or at least if there's an engine fail don't get stranded. Working together won't increase the speed unless there's some combo magic with the magic particles.</br></br></br></br>  <br> then a alien clone of her was found and finally mutated into a large combat space penis <br>Tsumugi isn't a Hoshijiro clone. She is the daughter of a Hoshijiro clone.</br></br>  <br> finally mutated into a large combat space penis <br>But that's completely wrong. Tsumugi isn't mutated EnaJiro, she's actually EnaJiro's daughter, as in somebody intentionally impregnated the Gauna-made clone of Hoshijiro and the child was a chimera, namely Tsumugi.</br></br>  <br><br>Guess I'll have to read up and find out why he'd even fuck her at this point, considering the sizable harem he already has, that's already tried to make moves on him.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So after the events of S2, there's now 2 EnaJiro's in Ochiai's lab? Not sure why but I just assumed he fucked it and then it mutated because space magic.</br></br></br>  <br>There's one in Ochiai's possession (at least until he takes over Kanata's body) and one with Toha.</br>  <br>None of the harem members really made a move as direct and straightforward as Kobayashi though. Nagate is dense as fuck, subtlety won't work.</br>  DIRECTOR's cut when???  <br>EnaJiro (first one) is in Ochiai's possession, BeniJiro (from Benisuzume) is locked up in a crate at Toha according to the manga.</br>  Can anyone point me towards the MT ftp? That whole revival project appears to be dead, but I'd like to DL KoS.  <br><br>Ignore me, found it and it's been revamped well.</br></br>  <br>If BeniJiro dies in that box, will she become the Box Ghost?</br>  <br>Wait, she doesn't have the cowtitumors from the show.</br>  <br>haha agreed he probably thinks that is the way you act around people you "like"</br>  And if you don't like?  <br>constantly apologizing for absolutely no reason probably</br>  <br>Not sure if her art appeal is suppose to be a trap, even tough she is technically a girl now, or just vaguely tomboyish even with the cow tumors that are sometimes there sometimes not</br>  <br>Ain't Izanas that big in the manga?</br>  <br>Netflix</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>only sometimes</br>  <br>Nice.</br>   We will never see Brozana again   <br>Hey, she's bro as fuck in the manga. Always has been.</br>  <br>doesn't count</br>  <br>Why doesn't it count?</br>  <br>You know why.</br>  <br>If I did I wouldn't be asking.</br>  Reminder that Izana is the only person Tanikaze cares about as much as rice balls.  Have you not been paying attention?  <br><br> Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br> Hoshijiro likes him because he rescued her and drank her piss. <br> Yuhata just likes him because he's famous. <br> Kobayashi loved his "grandfather" <br> Samari likes his skills and is a drunk <br> Izana cared about him since the beginning like a bro and later as a girl. <br><br>To sum up, everyone is a bitch except Izana, best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Glad the truth is finally being seen.  <br> Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br>You really should change this part of the pasta.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br>It's likely more than that at this point in the manga.</br></br>  <br>best grill</br>  <br> You will never see the sights of Sidonia with Riceball-chan </br>  Why is the first opening so good?  <br>Because Medieval Scape Hitler Boner.</br>  Just caught up to 75.<br><br>Captains personality changes a bit after fucking Nagate, and holy shit the volume of resources and time to produce things is out of whack. They shit out so many ships and pilots it's not funny. Pacing really feels fast after about c60.</br></br>  <br>*Space<br> What the fuck am I that drunk alreadyu </br></br>  <br>You can feel Nihei's grip on what makes Sidonia cool slip. As it gets more generic /m/ and more moe space penis, it gets less interesting.</br>  <br>Because Angela:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aoE<wbr>vKKAhSqQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>nice</br>  <br><br>Nagate isn't that fucking stupid, jesus. He's dense but not an idiot. He had no trouble acknowledging he liked Hoshijiro.<br><br>If you think the scene came out of nowhere that's the fault of Nihei's writing, not Nagate's emotional intelligence.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think that might be true.<br><br>The creepy mystery and exploration filters out, in favour of redshirts dying to gauna, new tech at impossible rates etc. Ochiai was a bit wasted. Nagate hasn't really had down time to deal with was revealed to him, no other harem members know yet, hasn't managed to talk to bear etc<br><br>I can understand introducing tech that he design hundreds of years ago, testing it and having it come back 30 chapters later, but there needed to be more to Captain's coup and Ochiai's slow progression to a chimera.<br><br>I also just feel like there wasn't any good reason to stay and fight that thing instead of fucking off into deep space and noping as far away as possible. We've still got gauna to deal with and understand their rather recent and rapid evolution, where the fuck kabi came from (that giant cheese holey ship).<br><br>As you say I think it went too generic mecha with side of harem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a brief flash of brilliance with the tsunbot rescue arc because it reduced the franchise to what made it work. Impossible odds, an unbeatable foe and neat little bits of character interactions.<br>I really hope that Polygon don't fuck it up if they make it that far in the future.</br></br>  <br>It happened again!</br>  <br>What did?</br>  I don't care.  <br>I thought S2 was pretty meh<br>but holy shit that ending couldn't have been better</br></br>  <br>I'd say S2 was pretty well done considering the source material.

It's all well and dandy when we're talking about how cool their 2D counterparts look in uniform, but reality influences fantasy and all that.  <br> Hetza appears to be focusing on Kantai collection <br><br>I'm ok with this.</br></br></br>  <br>the only obstacle is men raping them <br><br>and i'm not even talking about the enemy</br></br></br>  <br> the only obstacle is men raping them <br>Well that and women are less physically capable than men. And that's not sexist, that's just biology.</br></br>  <br>The Jews did it and they weren't half bad.<br><br>But because of how human nature is, you'd get pregnant soldiers every other day because of how genuinely boring war is most of the time. And I don't think most militaries would want to deal with the logistics of providing separate sex barracks, bathrooms, uniform sizes, female hygienic products, among other things unless they're desperately in need of more manpower. It's also important to remember on average, your female soldier will always be less capable than your male soldier. Of course there's going to be exceptions, but the average is what matters when it comes to an army.</br></br></br>  <br>If they can fight, they should be allowed to fight. I'd hold them to the same standards as males and ignore any special considerations they should get for their gender. If they want to be treated like men, they can get both sides of it.<br><br>Other than that  has it pretty much correct, except probably for the pregnancy part (war is boring as fuck, it's pretty much hurry up and wait).</br></br></br>  <br>Combat roles doesn't equal carrying a 240 bravo 16 hours a day and sprinting up mountains, there are hundreds of combat roles that take various amounts of physical effort, so if you want to narrow this down completely to just physical strength then i'm pretty sure you're stupid.</br>  <br> The Jews did it and they weren't half bad. <br>It's undeniable that there are some military roles that women can fill very well, often as well as their male counterparts. But this is not true of all roles, especially those in frontline combat or special forces.<br><br> But because of how human nature is, you'd get pregnant soldiers every other day because of how genuinely boring war is most of the time <br>Would condoms and such not solve that? (I think the Israeli army actually issues birth control, but I'm not 100% sure on that).<br><br> And I don't think most militaries would want to deal with the logistics of providing separate sex barracks, bathrooms, uniform sizes, female hygienic products, among other things unless they're desperately in need of more manpower. <br>But doesn't the US military already do this for its female members?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> f they can fight, they should be allowed to fight. I'd hold them to the same standards as males and ignore any special considerations they should get for their gender. <br>My sentiment exactly. Sexism shouldn't keep women out of frontline combat - their ability to meet the same requirements as men should be determinant. <br><br><br>Anon, don't be pedantic. We're talking about frontline infantry combat where physical capability is decisive. When this particular topic is brought up, it shouldn't have to be spelled out for you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> We're talking about frontline infantry combat <br><br>only since you moved the goalpost from "combat roles" to "frontline combat" just now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, from the very start I've said "frontline combat". See: </br>  Haven't been regularly visiting /k/ for a while, are /ak/ threads still allowed there?  <br>Yes. Though there's a good chance of it getting ruined by autists complaining about manga/anime in 4chan.</br>  As long as we're not in a /int/ thread in disguise, what does /ak/ proper think about gate so far?  <br>Japanese nationalistic power fantasy with waifus.<br><br>I have no interest if I'm honest. I gave it a watch to look for any /ak/ stuff, but I left disappointed.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't follow the manga, but the anime's been pretty fun so far. It's funny watching medievals gettin' blasted.</br>  <br>I was getting major Generation Kill vibes from Episode 2, I see it being pretty good if the anime goes down that route.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> sabagebu <br>That show was weird. So very weird.</br></br>  <br>Looks GAAAY!</br>  <br>It's ok.<br>They fucked up some design in the anime tho.<br><br>Also, I don't understand all the butthurt over it, especially CR removing the flag for a pretty lame excuse( "doesn't suit western audience").<br><br>Same thing happened this week on World of Warship, removing the rising sun flag.<br>I highly doubt there's veteran watching GATE/playing WoWs, it's getting hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Same thing happened this week on World of Warship, removing the rising sun flag. <br>The fuck? It's the Japanese naval flag!I didn't expect Wargaming.net to pulls hit like that.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait, it was in the game in the first place? I've been in since pretty damn close to the beginning of CBT on NA, and it's always been the PC flag.</br></br>  <br>Yeah.<br>Not to say this design is used pretty much on everything japan-ralated(eg: cons banners) and no one gives a damn.<br><br>I can understand for swastika,even if I personally think there's point point for such censors nowadays.<br><br><br>http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/5/449<wbr>5622/world-of-warplanes-removes-ris<wbr>ing-sun-flag-after-korean-gamers-ou<wbr>tcry<br>Can't find better source.</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't they just leave a red spot in the middle?</br>  <br> there's point point <br><br>There's no point*<br><br>Also, don't mind the article link mentioning "world of warplanes".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A previous version of this article stated the controversy was linked to World of Warplanes. The Rising Sun flag is actually used in World of Warships, and the article has been corrected to reflect this. <br>Man, Polygon are retarded.<br><br><br>Isn't the Red Dot off-centre in the old flag?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not to say this design is used pretty much on everything japan-ralated(eg: cons banners) and no one gives a damn. <br>That's not the crux of the issue for me. Whether it's right to use such a controversial flag so casually is not for us to decide. But by removing the flag from a historical-based game they're effectively censoring history.</br></br>  <br>Females in the IDF are not deployed to any hostile location.</br>  <br>Not a fan.</br>  <br>I thought they were deployed in support roles to hostile locations, no?</br>  I really like the combo of cute anime girls holding guns and doing military stuff the juxtaposition of the cuteness of the animes with the coolness of the guns is a nice combo. I wanna draw a picture now what gun should I draw an anime girl holding I dont know much about guns  Why is Deunan yet to be surpassed as far as /a/ operators go?  <br>Nah man, /ak/ has self control. I'd love for GATE threads to be nothing but /ak/, instead it's nothing but /pol/ and /int/ shitposters and it makes trying to enjoy the threads borderline impossible with all the idiocy. It's a pretty fun if not great show so far, I should just stop browsing them really.<br><br>It's particularly odd since the Self-Defence Forced still uses the flag. There are various market considerations for removing certain flags in games and at the end of the day I don't really care, it's a developer decision, but I did find it a bit strange since the MSDF still uses it prominently and the Ground Forces do as well for various ceremonial purposes.</br></br></br>  <br> It's particularly odd since the Self-Defence Forced still uses the flag. <br>Huh, I thought it was only the Naval branch's flag, or am I thinking of a different flag?</br></br>  <br>Not even the best Shirow operator.</br>  <br>Gunsmith Cats isn't Shirow.</br>  <br>I know that.</br>  <br>It wasn't clear based on context.<br>Who would you suggest as best Shirow operator?</br></br>  Wait I don't get it, there's no /ak/ board.    <br>It's a different flag, though both are of course utilizing/adapted from the same core design components.</br>  <br>No shit.</br>  <br>She's not really an operator, though.</br>  <br>Law Enforcement Officers can totally be operator.</br>  <br>I agree. Remember, I posted Deunan and she goes from SWAT to ESWAT. I'm just saying that Leona is not really operator.</br>  <br>Is the one in your pic there the navy-specific one that was used in WW2 by the IJN?</br>  <br>She operates a tank though.

Nice quads.<br><br>Also, what's the story with the variant with the yellow background?</br></br></br>  <br>I find it funny that in anime the Japanese depict the chinese as squinty eyed buck toothed people with round glasses and the Chinese depict the japanese as squinty eyed buck toothed people with round glasses.</br>  <br>I feel sexually attracted to the pistol she's holding.</br>  <br>Crew served handgun.</br>  <br>and? you're stupid for thinking the ability to do a few extra jumping jacks is going to win you a modern war. go ahead and keep thinking your sexist delusions, the rest of us'll be here laughing at you.</br>  <br>The yellow/orange one in the original pic you mean? Think it's the flag for the battalion those tanks are part of, can't remember which one though. In Hokkaido probably.</br>  <br>If a girl can't pass the physical standards for males, they have no business in a combat role.</br>  <br> the rest of us'll be here laughing at you. <br>And who is the rest of us, anon? <br><br>For example, is it sexist for a frontline infantry grunt to have the assurance that any of his squadmates could carry him to safety if he was wounded? <br><br>Also, bitching about perceived sexism on 4chan? Get a grip.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope that the guy version of this that is airing now will be good.</br>  <br>There's a guy version of it airing now?<br><br><br>No. It's the old rising sun flag, but with a yellow background instead of a white one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's pretty much the same concept of competing in survival games tournaments. it's worth watching only because of the  reverse  trap.</br>  <br> it's worth watching only because of the reverse trap. <br>You gotta give me the name of that show, anon.</br></br>  <br>Nice strawman. There are plenty of different combat roles requiring different skills or strengths.</br>  <br>because the only thing that matters is brute physical strength in a combat role<br><br>you're quite slow aren't you</br></br></br>  <br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07703</wbr></br></br>  <br>I watched the first episode, it's sort of like Ouran but with airsoft. It seemed alright. People like the manga a good deal but I wasn't super into it, I'll stick around for 3 episodes though.<br><br><br>Ah, yeah I'm not really familiar with the much older versions of said flag so can't be of much help there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being able to save your squad members' asses matters a fuckton, idiot.</br>  Why is the P90 the best Weapon ever created by man?  <br> because the only thing that matters is brute physical strength in a combat role <br>Never said it was the only thing, but it's pretty damn fucking important. There's a reason so much emphasis is put on physical fitness and lifting strength in training. <br><br>Seriously, if you're going to be this willfully ignorant, there's plenty of people on Tumblr who will assure you that you're 100% correct and the military is just sexist for requiring women to meet the same physical standards as men.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because leftys can use it without modifying it.</br>  <br><br>Does this circular discussion even matter? If a woman ends up in a combat role it means she passed the physical testing standards, which hurr durr I read on facebook aside, have not been altered to make that easier for them to do.<br><br>Someone who is not capable of performing to the physical standards of infantry should not be infantry yes, but they also won't, so engaging in endless hypotheticals is pointless.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they used it in Stargate SG-1. <br><br>Case closed.</br></br></br>  <br>It is a matter of fact that there's a multitude of combat roles that would not require that kind of ability. Removing women from performing that role over something that doesn't matter is sexist. End of.<br><br><br>Yes, but the issue is there's plenty of different infantry roles. Not all of them require EXTREME HULK STRENGTH like retards are trying to make out. It's essentially an excuse to close out those roles to women.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck off, if a woman cannot carry her squadmate, plus gear, she has no business being in a combat role.</br>  <br>Right I don't even disagree really, it just seems like this argument has reached that abstract stage where folks aren't even debating the same things anymore.</br>  <br> If a woman ends up in a combat role it means she passed the physical testing standards, which hurr durr I read on facebook aside, have not been altered to make that easier for them to do. <br>They haven't been altered yet, but there's serious consideration being put into lowering the standards for women due to pressure from equality groups. The fact that it's being considered at all is a worry.<br><br>But essentially you're right - as it stands, a woman can only end up in a frontline combat position if she meets the same requirements as the men. If she can meet those standards, she deserves to be there just as much as the men.<br><br><br> Yes, but the issue is there's plenty of different infantry roles. <br>ANY infantry role where it is conceivable that you may have to carry a lot of equipment or an injured squadmate should require the same fitness standards regardless of gender. This is different if you're a pilot or administration (which is why you'll often see women in these roles), but boots on the ground combat requires you to be able to lift shit. Get that through your thick skull.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i woman doesn't need to be super strong to be the gunner on an Abrams but she does need to be strong enough to pull her crew mates out if they get hit. most if not all require a high level of strength.</br>  <br>Which remind me- whose dick do I have to suck to get scans of that?</br>  <br>Mine.<br><br>I might not deliver though.</br></br></br>  <br>So what if it's abstract? If anything it's important to correct people on their mentality and incorrect assertions, as you can see here- the kind of mental gymnastics people are going through to keep up the delusion of "oh no women so weak" (even though it's established they could do plenty without that strength), if unchallenged leads to the invention of more barriers.</br>  <br> No PLA edition <br><br>Why? They got qt aesthetics.</br></br></br>  <br> I might not deliver though. <br>Yeah, erectile dysfunction is a bitch.</br></br>  <br> keep up the delusion of "oh no women so weak" <br>Its not a delusion. On average, women are more physically weak than men.</br></br>  <br><br> I find it funny that in anime the Japanese depict the chinese as squinty eyed buck toothed people with round glasses and the Chinese depict the japanese as squinty eyed buck toothed people with round glasses. <br><br><br>Both the same. Just like American WWII era propaganda</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats all they got.</br>   sjw discussion in my /ak/ <br><br>What is this ?</br></br>  <br> Just like American WWII era propaganda <br>we had some great anti jap propaganda Goebbels would have been proud.</br></br>  <br>Fine anon.<br>Lets make women share the same minimum standards as men in the military.<br>I'm sure they're going to love when you tell them they have to do 20 more push ups, sit ups, and run the 1.5 three minutes faster to pass.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, can I ask what do you have against unisex standards for men and women in the military? Plenty of other countries have such a system in place. My own home country, Ireland, requires that men and women meet the exact same physical standards, but in return the women don't meet any discrimination in the roles they apply for. That is the paragon of fairness.<br><br><br>It's just one ignorant guy demanding that women get special treatment in the military. He doesn't have a leg to stand on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ZTD-05-kun kawaii</br>   Doffy is dying <br> Urouge has no idea what the fuck is going on downstairs <br> Akainu is probably magmafisting his table <br>Goda truly delivers</br></br></br>  I think this is the beginning of Akainu shifting into the "Villain no one will take seriously"<br><br>Not yet, but soon</br></br>  <br>Naruto is different from One Piece, idiot.</br>  <br>Akainu is already taken seriously and that won't stop, barbaric pirates like Blackbeard's crew run away when they see him.</br>  <br>Doffy is dying</br>  <br>We don't know, Law survived from situations he should have survived from, like how Kyros managed to stand up after getting mortally wounded.</br>  <br>we know because this is One Piece</br>  <br>Yes, thank you for your precision.</br>  <br> Law survived from situations he should have survived from, like how Kyros managed to stand up after getting mortally wounded. <br>We already had countless characters who survived shit they should not have, you say that as if this is exclusive to Dressrosa</br></br>  Jesus. Besides Sabo is there anyone up right now who could keep the 100% Healthy Fujitora away from taking luffy and Law's booty cheeks?  <br>Are you stupid? I never said it only happens in Dressrosa. I just gave the two most recent examples. Idiot.</br>  <br>They are the same on one thing: they have an ending. One Piece is working towards one. There are lots of story to go through, but nothing changes that. 15 more years is pretty reasonable.</br>  <br>Fujitora went easy on Sabo, he could have used meteorites but he didn't because he cared for Dressrosa's inhabitants, please don't be such a speedreader.<br><br><br>He'll probably do more though and if you don't agree then you are helpless.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he could have used meteorites but he didn't because he cared for Dressrosa's inhabitants, please don't be such a speedreader. <br>He used meteorites but the Birdcage fucked them up and made them hit a wider radius. Sabo wasn't even phased by it because he just turned into fire.</br></br>  <br>Yeah theres one.<br>Me.<br><br>I'm fucking strong as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No you are stupid if you think the birdcage is stronger than several meteorites, and Fujitora had a probably trump card. But you don't think this because you are stupid and love Sabo (Sabo is a great character and I like him too because you love him too much and think he is invincible).</br>  <br>Law will save everyone,obviously.<br> stamina is my weak point guys </br></br>  <br>I don't think he's dying, meant to greentext that.</br>  <br> No you are stupid if you think the birdcage is stronger than several meteorites <br>But it has literally being shown that the birdcage sliced the meteorites in tiny pieces</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure how my comment indicates speedreading. Maybe you shouldn't speed read my post. I didnt say "beat" or "kill" i said KEEP AWAY. If you think that fujitora could just ignore Sabo then im not sure we are reading the same manga. Also if he cared about civilians before then he would still care now so... im not entirely sure of your point.</br>  <br>you type like an underaged autist</br>  <br>Law died.</br>  <br>merelypretending.png</br>  <br> most popular character <br> dying <br>I wish. We'll have Law around for other 100 chapters. They both need to go to Zou.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even like Sabo all that much and think that Fuji was clearly having an advantage, but meteors wouldn't have done anything to Sabo, and he showed it. You can't use Haki on a meteorite, and Fuji clearly hadn't thought about the Birdcage when he used a meteorite which was literaly sliced by the Birdcage. As far as we've been shown, those strings were literally unbreakable.</br>  <br> implying having limited stamina ever meant something in One Piece </br>  Luffy vs Law<br><br>Who wins?</br></br>  <br>My pussy because it gets wet instantly when they touch themselves even for a second</br>  <br>OK I agree with you.<br><br><br>Exactly, I bet Law will save Doflamingo because he thought of him as his father. And Doflamingo's brother was like his big brother.<br><br><br>Are you stupid? Fujitora also has a trump card or he wouldn't be an admiral, idiot.<br><br><br>So you're stupid yeah... Sabo didn't keep Fujitora away, it's Fujitora who used Sabo as a pretext to stay away. Fujitora is an admiral and Sabo just got his fruit, but you are a Sabo fanatic (I am just a Sabo lover) so you think Sabo is invincible.<br><br><br>Do you mind not using autist as an insult.<br><br><br>Stop with your stupid excuses, Fujitora manipulates gravity not meteorites and he could have used a special gravity attack to beat Sabo easily. You forgot the nature of his power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is what Lawfags believe </br>  <br>Law.<br><br>He sliced full ni**a Vergo in half like it was nothing.<br>Luffy ain't even half ni**a he's like 25% with G4 right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Theoretically Law could beat just about anyone in a single move, but going with the way Oda design fights it'd get drawn out and Luffy would win</br>  <br>No one can defeat the Raw.

The only thing that negates DF are Seastone X</br>  <br>KUBOOOOOO<br><br>Whoever made this edit is legendary</br></br></br>  <br>I've gotten bored with reversetrolls like you so I stopped replying to you, did you notice? You can write whatever you want, but people will reply to me because they aren't reversetrolls like you who call someone shitposter just because they don't agree.<br><br><br>No I'm not Sakazuki.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> well known <br>Please, that's just some small time autist. Pork Wrangler was a well known shitposter, this is just a little faggot who comes to some threads, I had never even noticed a pattern in his posting.</br></br></br>  <br>Vergo was a nobody introduced just to get cut in half. <br>What did he do in punk hazard other than being a nigger?</br></br>  <br>epic meme image<br>are you perhaps a meme master?</br></br>  REMINDER DO NOT REPLY TO THE ATTENTION WHORE FAGGOT WITH THE WORST OPINIONS OF ALL TIME  <br>Luffy's ripping off his enemies posture</br>  <br> Exactly, Law should be able to beat anyone but Oda is forced to make him weak. <br>I literally just said that some posts earlier. Why are you repeating it?</br></br>  Fujitora is going to join the crew. Prove me wrong.  <br>First, don't use the word "nigger" which is racist, seconly, Vergo was a big threat in Punk Hazard, but he had a lot of opponents so he couldn't win of course. He is strong but not invincible. You are stupid. <br><br><br>Do you have copyrights for your post?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He broke Sanji's leg and beat the shit out of Law and Smoker.</br>  <br>Easily one of the best things to come from the Bleach generals</br>  Don't mind me I just felt a sudden urge to post this image  <br>It's very easy to see a pattern in his posting<br>It was way funnier back in the day when he did the Uncle Sam rebecca manifest though</br></br>  Is Crocus more capable than Kureha?  <br><br>He beat the shit out of everyone in sight. Law only won because Vergo got cocky over his Haki, he would have won he had kept using his speed.<br><br>To beat Law you just need to be faster, he isn't really invincible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was strong as fuck.<br><br>Not even Rayleigh mastered haki like this.</br></br></br>  <br> Do you have copyrights for your post? <br>I didn't tell you not to repeat me, I asked why you're being redundant. Stop speedreading, idiot.</br></br>  <br>But if Haki can mitigate his capacity to use his DF to cut, as Vergo believed his Haki was strong enough to do, then while there's no evidence to directly support it, I'd like to think it makes his capacity to teleport things more limited.</br>  <br>Luffy beats Law out in physical strength but Law probably has the edge overall due to having the most overpowered DF in the series, one gamma knife and it's over. Very, very, very few people in One Piece have a way of dealing with scrambled internal organs and Luffy is not among them.<br><br>So yes, law wins but takes an incredible amount of damage in the process. Think Luffy vs Lucci, Akainu vs Aokiji, etc</br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to him holy shit</br>  <br>Enel would be flattered.<br><br>It's always nice to inspire a fucking piece of shit copycat monkey fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> back in the day <br>Dude, that wasn't long ago at all.</br></br>  <br>Zori and the samurais maybe, though I suppose anyone else has questionable trouble with him because his power is fucking gravity, just Law because teleport, but he's probably not going to fight, and Sabo for being a logia.<br>But I think Fujitora is for actual justice not wg/marine propaganda. Just going to turn a blind eye, or two.</br></br>  <br>nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger</br>  <br>Fujitora is an admiral.<br>He doesn't want to leave the Marines, he wants to change this organization from the inside.<br>And he is too strong.<br>I proved you wrong, so now go away, your theory has no point.<br><br><br>Idiot.<br><br><br>I'm not going to stay here all the time, it's my holidays. I won't waste my time using paint just for you, did you think I was your servant? <br><br><br>You don't even know how strong Rayleigh is.<br><br><br>You're right, Vergo was stronger than Law.<br><br><br>I asked you if you had copyrights.<br>No you don't so go away.<br><br><br>Law can just teleport himself away and Luffy would never be able to hit him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My haki is stronger, no easy cut.<br><br>And done.</br></br></br></br>    <br> He'll probably do more though and if you don't agree then you are helpless. <br><br>Well, you could be right. After all, he has been pushing back the end date estimation for years now. But the nearer we are to the end, the more accurate the estimation. At the time of the timeskip, Oda said he was halfway done (so in 2011, he stated 12 years left). Last year (2014), he gave it another decade. Let's extrapolate and what do we get? 14 years.</br></br></br>  <br> Not even Rayleigh mastered haki like this. <br>I don't think that's true. Black haki isn't necessarily better. I mean we've never seen Shanks with it even when he stopped Akainu and he's supposed to be the haki god.<br>Also I think speading haki over larger areas of your body makes it less effective than concentrating it into a smaller area.</br></br></br>  <br>All I know is Rayleigh is old and busted and he never showed mastery of a full ni**a mode.</br>  <br>No way, Kureha has more or less 125 years of experience and now she seems to be more active in medical work than Crocus</br>  <br>Not really.<br><br><br>Well post whatever you want, I don't care.<br><br><br>Mangas aren't like mathematics, you can't change that.<br><br><br>So you are ignorant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Almost thought you'd posted the Kid version of this.</br>  <br>Kami-sama is great.</br>   people actually like jizz on their waifu's beautiful face <br><br>The fuck?</br></br>  <br>vagina detected</br>    <br> 4chan <br> censoring nigga <br> censoring yourself <br>wtf is wrong with you</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's only one person, ignore this shitposter.<br><br><br>Women aren't objects.<br><br><br>Go away once and for all.<br><br><br>What's wrong with censor? It's a NSFW board.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have seen this on other boards recently<br>is that some new meme or something?</br></br>  <br> So you are ignorant <br>So when are you gonna call me a dumb boy?</br></br>  <br>Dumb kid.<br><br><br>No, it's people who are a tiny bit intelligent and censor themselves when they are about to say racist things.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wtf is wrong with you <br>The fuck?</br></br>  Rebeccafag is back? Aw hell no  <br> new <br><br>Fuck off, newf*g. This meme has been around since 2001.</br></br></br>  <br> post whatever you want, I don't care <br> go away one and for all <br>???</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off, jewnigger</br>  I think I'm just going to leave until things are back to normal.  could we just start the homo posting now<br><br>we're way behind schedule</br></br>  Still the greatest scene of all anime?  <br><br><br>When will summer ends</br></br></br>  <br>Don't misuse the word "logical".</br>  <br>1.

I just finished re-watching this anime, and it could've been one of my favorite, if only they ended it the way the author wanted it to end. <br><br>Fuck it, I'm so pissed</br></br>  <br>Why lurk?</br>  I want 50 more.  <br>Not that anon but Kirino and Kyousuke quickly became my OTP. I'll probably hang around the threads when they pop up.</br>    <br>But not contribute anything?</br>  Is there any summary/spoiler for vol.9 yet?<br><br>Reminder that the translation for vol.5 will released today.</br></br>  <br>I have some idea climb sees him kill some scrubs and begs him to train him. Sebas says he will if he can avoid his attack. Climb manages to move despite sebas's killing intent freezing him Brain sees the whole thing and runs up asking how the fuck climb did that, because he couldn't move at all, and if he can get in on the training.<br><br>Climb has at least two martial arts. Fortress and slash.</br></br></br>  <br>This would have been so great animated.<br><br>Imagine seeing a bug maid charging at you with her four monstrous legs using the buildings as supports.</br></br></br>  <br>Octo is that you?</br>  <br>We can only hope nip taste doesn't once again turn out to be absolute shit and they actually buy the discs.<br><br>Collecting the whole series would be bit too expensive for me but I'd pitch in for good Albedo &amp; Papa Bones figs.</br></br></br>  <br>Entoma a cute.
