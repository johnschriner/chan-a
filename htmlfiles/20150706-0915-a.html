What happened in that interview?  <br>nips didn't even post this interview at all</br>  Oyasumi Punpun is overrated  <br>I always hated the art. It looks stiff and boring. It's just lots of grey.</br>  <br>Did you expect a manga to be colourful?</br>  <br> being this retarded </br>  <br>that fucking ending</br>  <br>It really is. <br>It's just the same story beats being repeated again and again.</br></br>  And the misleading OP award goes to....<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UNj<wbr>HxhljAck</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Look at the title of Gakkou Gurashi, the ã‚‰ character in particular. What does this symbolize? That this is the point of view from Yuki Takeya?  <br>Y'think they're going to keep the show from Yuki's eyes until her eventual meltdown when  Megu-nee is found in the basement? </br>  <br><br>Look guys. Germanfag here, too, but it really isn't that hard. Either use a Youtube Unblocker Add-on (doesn't work with Chrome because google-mafia) or try<br>http://www.zalmos.com/<br>or shit like that</br></br></br></br>  <br>No need to tell me, for everyone already uses it.<br><br>But the very fact that one has to resort to this shit in an 'democratic and free' country, is already unacceptable.</br></br></br>  <br>I definitely have the feeling the show will probably lead on the audience with a normal everyday life for a few episodes. Whether this normal everyday life is delusional or not, I'm not sure.</br>  ITT: Based MC'S      <br> BD <br> dat quality </br></br>  Will there ever be a cooler MC?  <br>Anime never.</br>  How strong are the police shields?  <br><br>I thought those were generally designed to lock onto objects with high heat, like jet engines. Would dragons be hot enough?</br></br>  <br>Radar-lock comes from bouncing radar waves off of the target, not reading waves emitted by the target, so those would work just fine. Heat-seeking missiles might work too if dragons have lots of fire inside of them. And there's always having your gunner point the gat manually.</br>  I was kind of sad they didn't adapt this panel here showing the police charging at the soldiers while they were all SQUAD BROKEN.  <br>TV-guided munitions</br>  <br> ARREST THEM </br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #6<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>So who's the next lucky faggot who gets his waifu drawn by you?</br>  <br> maybe one day, I just do what I want for now. <br>That's cool.

Thank you again apples, hope you have a chill rest of the weekend. Oh yeah don't use emoticons, its not welcomed round' these parts.</br>  <br>I will! thanks for doing it</br>  The first single Seiten Galaxy Cross was leaked ahead of release date on Nyaa.<br>Here's the full song<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/wfjtczrnqa.fla<wbr>c</wbr></br></br>  Which miracle dies first?  Has anyone made a vector of the title image at the end of the episode yet?  <br>But "Oh my God!" comes really close to the original meaning.</br>      shows that are dub&gt;sub  Yu Yu Hakusho dub was great, but that's just my opinion.   ALL DUBS ARE SHIT ALL DUBS ALL DUBS <br><br>This is truly my most favourite meme</br></br>  <br>Guess you haven't watched Desert Punk.<br>The dub is better only cause of the jokes and Rain Spider though.</br></br>   Not watching your Anime muted while playing Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.8 and No.19, or alternatively one of his many String Quartets. <br><br> Having the nerve to watch anime on a screen any smaller than 60 inches and at anything less than 720p, without a glass of wine that is at least equal to or above the caliber of Dom Perignon. <br><br> Thinking that you can truly understand the Japanese tongue before having seen the Cherry blossoms in person as they fall upon your cheek while you run in a rushed, yet gingerly manner with toast hanging out of your mouth. <br><br> Thinking that any Anime made by a director that doesn't suffer from depression and works with animators that work less than 18 hours a day should even make it onto your palette let alone be worth your time to judge the audio quality and its various versions. <br><br> Not understanding that Anime was a mistake from the start and that despite the preparations you should make before watching it, mentioned at the beginning of this post, started going downhill (in terms of overall quality) after 1918. <br><br>I knew I was among casuals, just not casuals of this bottom scrapping quality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    No one hyped for Overlord? It's a virtual gaming reality anime like SAO and Accel Word.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuN<wbr>APPcjDr4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> 2 days left </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pure speculation:  just like how the npcs personalities are also affected by their creators personalities which have absolutely nothing to do with their settings unless purposely made so, I believe that their memories of the supreme one dialogues are merely due to the chat log/audio log of the game and thereby they did not 'personally' hear it but rather were implanted with the memory through the log in some skewed way. Remember, though they recall all these memories, Aura and Mare acted as if they've only met Ainz for the first time in the first volume on the 6th floor. That's irrational if you think about it. </br>  <br> SAO </br>  <br>No I mean that's just what I gathered from the tidbits of the lore. It would be pretty silly that the World Eater and World Champions weren't linked in some way.<br><br>Hence the reason they had so OP gear and could only choose one as their reward for being their World's respective Champion, and when Touch Me used his chosen armor set for being unbeatable in PvP with his build, it's ability or the item itself got adjusted/revoked.<br><br>He didn't leave because of that though, that seemed to stem from real life issue between Touch Me and Urbet, both ended up quitting and Touch Me either passed the baton to Momonga as leader or he took the chance for being one of the Original Nine.<br><br>But this is just second hand shit I got from discussions with those who have read the raws and further ahead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm confused here, some of the spoiler says that in the LN version  Ainz didn't side with anyone and actually build his own empire. <br><br> I know that in the WN version that he sided with the empire, but is it also the same in the LN? </br></br></br>  <br>they didn't though, Ainz commented on the fact that Aura acted like she knew Ainz since a long time ago, while Ainz hadn't actually interacted with Aura in the same way.</br>   people complaining first few episodes are slice of life and not constant punching <br><br>why are people watching this if they havent seen DBZ?</br></br>  <br> &gt;deciding this after one episode. <br> Ok</br></br>  <br>The entire great saiyaman saga was filler and that was god tier</br>  Anybody got that Lion king quote?  Where can I find subs?  We've been spoiled with DBKai the last years, this seems to go back to DBZ pace. <br><br>This does not take away my disappoint though.<br><br>Especially because the first enemy is going to be Beerus. wtf. He was from that horrible battle of the gods movie.</br></br></br></br>  Why does she wear the mask?  Great first episode but I can see it getting old pretty quick unless it goes in an unexpected direction     <br>How did the males manage to cum without masturbating?</br>  <br>Behind the dirty joke this story is about oppressed high school girl turn terrorist.</br>  <br>Was being a pubescent boy that long ago anon?</br>  <br><br>Because that entire ordeal lasted for 3 minutes, not 30 seconds like the show makes it seem like.<br><br>On top of that, if you've got a cute girl voicing the dialogue and roleplay, it's way hotter. Plus if the girls next to you are getting off, you can smell it; and it makes you even more aroused.<br><br>I shouldn't have to explain this to you. God damn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shame. she has the best design out of the CVs.  <br> I believe KanColle fans will act in a similar civilized manner. </br>  <br> I believe KanColle fans will act in a similar civilized manner. </br>  <br>If by kancolle fans you mean anything nonclapper related then yes. Expect a lot ot potato replies for what you said.</br>  <br> I believe KanColle fans will act in a similar civilized manner. </br>  <br>Scrapping time.</br>  OH SHIT, IT'S A 2 PAGE SPREAD. THIS MUST MEAN IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING. I MEAN, SHE JUST CONFESSED. THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN BACK OFF FROM THIS CONFESSION NOW.  <br>Raku picks  ruri *</br>   Nieskoi <br> Ride ending <br> people still following this shit </br></br>  <br>I don't know why I keep reading this shit, I still remember the day I read the one-shot. Every chapter just reaffirms my disgust with it's completely terrible storyline. Literally cannot get off this ride and don't know why.</br>  ENDING NEXT CHAPTER  <br>Marika can get them out of jail.</br>  What defines a good anime? All I see is hype shit these days with big name pop stars doing the OP like amazerashi and eir aoi. Then slap on a couple of tits and some kawaii bitch and you successfully secured yourself a tween fanbase.<br><br>What is good narrative and storytelling anymore?</br></br>  <br>Life means for you to watch more anime obviously.</br>  <br>My stance is that "good writing" (if you deny the subjective definitions we've offered) literally is a senseless term, in that it doesn't have a referent. Give a definition of what "good writing" is, and then I'll think about whether it exists. And no, I don't mean a set of guidelines to follow to make a good piece, I mean a definition.</br>  <br>Agree with this. I've watched well north of 2000 shows over the past 12 years. I've enjoyed stuff from all genres.<br><br>Though at the same time, it's become increasingly difficult for me to name any show I can name as my favorite for the season. I still enjoy anime, but I've become jaded to the point where I can't even tell why I'm watching something, and I certainly don't get as excited as I used to. I just watch anime because that's what I've been doing every season for 12 years in a row.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you applied for a job there?</br>  <br>Take a break for one season, anon. Then come back to us.</br>  Is there anything he can't do?  <br>He can't lose.</br>  <br>Everyone has a smell, it's not uncommon to find your girlfriend's scent as arousing or like to sleep on their pillow because it smells like them.</br>  I read chapter 16 and it said miya was the one who made tatsuya to destroy the word for her sister? Was the translator on shrooms or some shit? <br><br>Had no idea that head was married a lowly guardian. The fuck is he thinking with all those semen demons available.</br></br>  <br>He was confused by her vast misunderstanding of the situation. She thought he took advantage of her and then said but I don't mind, take advantage of me any time, my body belongs to you. Tatsuya was like what in the world is this sister or mine thinking, silly girl. The idea never crossed his mind and he left before she could embarass herself any further.</br>  <br><br> Traditional Chuuni with a lifetime's experience for maximum stu <br><br>Pretty much</br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
