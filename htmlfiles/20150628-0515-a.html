[ Tell me, /a/. What is the best anime, and why is it Ie No Naka de Cory?    Ruri soon.  Sora when?  Yuya vs Yugo when?  <br>not for like another 12 episodes at least</br>  <br>Who?<br><br><br><br>Yugo will duel Yuya because he sees him dueling the KINGU and gets jealous</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In that case,I hope Yuzu hits him with the fan one day. It's like they forgot that gag.</br>  <br>Sora will probably appear in Synchro Dimension once Leo decides to send Yuri and Sora there with the Obelisk Force.<br><br>If Sora stays at Academia for whatever reason (I doubt it Leo needs all the help he can get to capture Yuzu and Serena), he could be used to properly introduce Ruri and Rin into the story if he meets both of the Ruris while they are imprisoned. Though I think Yuri and Sora's roles will be reversed compared to last time.<br><br>Meaning Yuri's mission will be to capture Serena (and succeed because Yuri is that good) while Sora's mission will be to capture Yuzu (and fail to do do. Meaning Yuzu wins the duel and escapes, Sora wins the duel but Yuzu escapes him regardless, or the duel is interrupted by someone like Yugo which allows Yuzu to escape and/or Sora gets BTFO).<br><br>Either way, it will end with Serena being captured and Yuzu will be reunited with Yuya.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  why is yu ya  so perfect  How many people and who are they going to recruit people from the Synchro Dimension?  <br>shinji is the most likely one <br><br>some characters from friendship cup maybe<br><br>the fact that they're doing high speed riders and making speed roids an actual thing makes me think yugo might not get absorbed</br></br></br></br></br>  post the arc-v mega link  what would be the best final boss of arc-v? I'd say the 4 previous protagonists vs the 4 Yu's  <br> https://mega.co.nz/#F!pN8SRTRQ!5JGF<wbr>8ifwaqTJN-XSjOERLg</wbr> </br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br>evolved yuri</br>  <br>The previous protagonists shouldn't appear at all, and especially not in that way.</br>  <br> not wanting to see supreme king jaden as the true leader of academia </br>  <br>I am Ruri.</br>  <br>You're right, I don't. They had their series already, go back and watch those if you really must see them again and let Yuya have his show himself.</br>  <br> a previous character appearing even if it's in the final few episodes automatically means the main character will have the show stolen from him regardless of the countless duels and development they've had </br>  <br>The previous protagonists had their fucking show, leave them there. And yes, if they show up in the final few episodes, the show will start fellating them at the expense of the show, and I know you faggots will accept it because MUH YUGI/JUDAI/YUSEI SO EPIC.</br>    <br>They're all better than Yuya and Yuya clones.</br>  <br>Then go watch those shows if you think they're so much better.</br>  <br>No.</br>  Did Sound Duel 3 have this song?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=knG<wbr>bdJAfuJ0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br><br><br><br>You're being a real asshole m8. Arc-V is a series made for the 20th anniversary of Yu-Gi-Oh. The reason why Pendulum Summoning, Academia, City, Heartland, different dimensions, the fact that everyone in Standard can use different Summoning Methods, and shit like Professors, Security, Jack, Crow, etc. are all present is because of this anniversary. <br><br>You're saying you want Arc-V to be its own series and run on its own plot points but fail to realize some of those plot points are from other series. The main villainous groups right now are a Duel Academy and Sector Security, both from GX and 5D's. Shun and Yuto, the two characters that people say marked off the start of Arc-V getting really interesting are from Heartland from ZEXAL. The first opponent Yuya faced officially was a guy using Battleguards, from DM owned by Joey and Tristan. <br><br>Arc-V has been fellating off of previous series since the very first fucking episode and it's supposed to because it is celebrating those previous series. <br><br>Also<br>  the show will start fellating them at the expense of the show <br><br>People said the same thing about Crow but Crow has did literally nothing so far</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>None of that means the protagonists will or should show up at all. They had their show, leave them there. Also, nothing has been explicitly said that Arc-V is an anniversary show, and in fact all the new DM related stuff HAS been stated to be related to the anniversary. You just sound upset that someone doesn't want to see muh Yugi/Yusei/Judai showing up in Arc-V.</br>  Everyone shut the hell up and post Serena  <br> None of that means the protagonists will or should show up at all. <br>I didn't say it did, where did you get that from?<br><br>The fact that Arc-V is celebrating all the past series and started airing near the anniversary time really suggests that the series was made as an anniversary saga, and how the show is being treated, its blatantly obvious. <br><br> You just sound upset that someone doesn't want to see muh Yugi/Yusei/Judai showing up in Arc-V. <br><br>All that strawposting is ridiculous. I don't even care if they return  maybe Judai  as I could care less. What I'm saying that you seem to not be understanding as all these callbacks and references and characters appearing from past series conveys a high chance that the previous protagonists will appear. It's not impossible and the fact that Jack and Crow are back should have put the possibility in your dense head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems like fanartists like to depict Serena as a hungry Ruri lately.</br>  <br>No, it doesn't give a "high chance" for the previous protagonists to appear, but it does give a reasonable chance for other, non protagonist characters to appear. And the only explicit thing they've done is bring Crow and Jack back, and even then they're clearly different characters than their 5D's versions, everything else has been references and callbacks, nothing more.<br><br>And the entire argument before hasn't been "could they?", it's "SHOULD they?". And they shouldn't. You're the one that turned this into a "well the possibility is there," I fucking know the possibility is there, that doesn't mean I have to be for it happening.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, Yusei's VA already confirmed he wasn't called to come back.</br>  Ruris are the fucking best.  Kill those who disrespect Ruri    <br> 4 on 4 duel <br>Fuck no, the 3 v 1s are messy enough as is</br></br>  <br>Omni-Yuya vs Omni-Yuzu<br>Yubel-fied Yuya+Yuzu vs Super Mega Darkness God<br><br>Probably something along those lines.</br></br></br></br>  why does everyone in this anime have secondary hair  <br> secondary hair </br>  <br> No, it doesn't give a "high chance" for the previous protagonists to appear, but it does give a reasonable chance for other, non protagonist characters to appear. <br>Yes it does. Crow and Jack alone ARE protagonists from 5D's so previous protagonists CAN appear. <br><br> even then they're clearly different characters than their 5D's versions <br><br>But then who's to say the previous protagonists won't be different characters from their original versions? You're trying to make it seem like if they'll appear they'll be in full glory which they won't. Like I said before, people said Crow would ruin the series as soon as he touched an Arc-V episode because he overshadowed so many characters when he was introduced in 5D's originally being a side character, yet he's done nothing of the kind in Arc-V. He hasn't done anything and has overshadowed no one. <br><br> And the entire argument before hasn't been "could they?", it's "SHOULD they?". And they shouldn't. <br><br>Yeah and all you've said for why they shouldn't is because YOU think they will immediately ruin the show by the show pandering to them. All you are trying to say is that you don't want them to appear. You even said it with this<br> that doesn't mean I have to be for it happening. <br><br>You haven't said any reasonable reason why they shouldn't appear besides the show might pander to them. Even if they appear in the final few episodes you still think they would somehow ruin the show by the show catering to them. Just like you said to me, you don't want them to appear because "the possibility is there" that they will ruin the show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone.</br>   the black characters are the bodyguards   <br>hair of a different color/style on top of the one they have</br>  <br>Selena's hungry duel when</br>  <br> Yes it does. Crow and Jack alone ARE protagonists from 5D's so previous protagonists CAN appear. <br>You dont know what that word means, protagonist literally means chief actor in Greek, you cant have more than one.<br><br> But then who's to say the previous protagonists won't be different characters from their original versions? <br>They'd have to minimalised so much to not take the spotlight that it'd be pointless. No way wouldnt we have seen Yusei have an effect on the universe if he wasnt anywhere near the person he was in 5Ds.<br><br> You haven't said any reasonable reason why they shouldn't appear besides the show might pander to them <br>Yuseis VA straight up said he wasnt coming back<br>They would have announced it to hype up the series if they were<br>Paying previous MCs to come back would be expensive as fuck for Arc V (I'm amazed they managed to get Kenn back for the movie)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Crow and Jack alone ARE protagonists from 5D's so previous protagonists CAN appear. <br>They're not THE protagonists. Jack and Crow means other, non-protagonists can appear, but not THE protagonists.<br><br>And no, I said they shouldn't appear because they ALREADY HAD their show, and I'd rather they stay the fuck there. And yes, they would ruin the show by appearing in the final few episodes, because those final few episodes would suddenly be focusing on them instead of the already established Arc-V characters. What, do you seriously think they'd just have Yugi/Judai/Yusei/Yuma in a SMALL role if they reappeared?</br></br></br></br>  Is the upcoming DM movie not enough for nostalgiafags? Arc-V's already crowded in terms of characters, no need to bring in more  Do you want to take a photo of yourself desu~?  Today's manzai is just Sawatari and Yuya.<br><br>Sawatari's pretty excited about the Entertainment Duel Tournament and says he can't sleep because of it. Yuya is excited too, but he wants to sleep. Sawatari keeps bothering him of course.<br><br> tfw no Serena to stop Sawatari being a bother. </br></br></br></br>  <br>NO. It won't be enough unless they announce a GX movie right after, Yugi uses powerful retrained versions of Curse of Dragon, The two silent monsters, some new monsters that make Dark magician and girl not shit, and some maybe a boss ritual monster that's actually playable.</br>  <br> It won't be enough unless they announce a GX movie right after <br> Kenn <br> Ever agreeing to do an entire GX movie <br><br> More DM nostalgia support <br>Holy fuck, sets are already flooded with Red Eyes and BLS stuff</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's hilarious considering the magazine previews didn't even hide that Sawatari gets wrecked right away.</br>  The movie will likely be Yugi vs Kaiba sitting on their aces and whatever new forms they get the entire duel with maybe a cameo of Dark Magician Girl destroying something before dying and fucking off for the rest of the film. I really hope they don't bring back the dweeb patrol as commentators,  <br> No Serena to stop Sawatari being a bother. <br> Sawatari would constantly bother Yuya unless Serena is there to stop him <br><br><br>Wasn't he getting rekt by Security again and not against Chojiro?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, that was for episode 63. The manzai preview for today is for episode 62.</br>  <br>That preview was for 63, which is when everyone tries to jailbreak. The prison tourney is what leads into the jailbreak due to Shinji's plan, somehow.</br>  <br>sorry for the scrub question but what's a manzai<br><br><br>i hope he beats or doesn't get beat by chojiro, as in the duel is interrupted<br><br>i don't think i can handle two back to back losses</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>solid digits you have there my man</br>  <br>It's just an omake or extra after DM remaster's episode airs.<br><br>They replay the preview for Arc-V's next episode, then add an extra commentary from the characters with cute chibi pictures.<br><br>They call it manzai though since there's supposed to be at least an idiot guy and another guy who calls out the idiocy or at least notices it.</br></br></br></br></br>  How did Shun manage to get so many RUM cards?  <br> heart of the cards babyyyyyyy </br>  <br>Its been so fucking long since they were last on screen together. Yuya must be dying from citrus deprivation</br>  <br>Thanks you like my work.<br><br>Yuugo is the other big victim</br></br></br>  Today's manzai:<br><br> Sawatari: Tomorrow is the Entertainment Duel Tournament!! <br><br> Yuya: You look pretty excited about it! <br><br> Sawatari: Yeah! It's been awhile since we had an exciting duel! You get some sleep too in preparation for tomorrow! <br><br> Yuya: That's right! Good night! <br><br> Sawatari: Yeah! ...Hey, what's that name of your hippo again? <br><br> Yuya: Eh? It's Hippo? Good night. <br><br> Sawatari: You too! ...Hey, do you want me to show you my new deck? <br><br> Yuya: It's Underworld Troupe! I already know that. I just want some sleep! <br><br> Sawatari: I'm so excited that I can't sleeeep! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Sawatari: Yeah! ...Hey, what's that name of your hippo again? <br><br>What the fuck, Sawatari, how can you forget the most useless of Yuya's Entermate monsters?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Hey, what's the name of your hippo again? <br> &gt;Eh? It's Hippo? <br><br>I can't tell if that's cute or a bit stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean scurvy.</br>  <br><br>Oh I forgot to mention a note about that. Sawatari uses the Japanese word for hippo which is「カバ」[kaba]. And in reply, Yuya says the english word and it's name, 'Hippo'.</br></br>  <br> Caring about TRASH cards </br>  <br>nice work</br>  <br> &gt;Sawatari: Yeah! ...Hey, what's that name of your hippo again? <br> &gt;Yuya: Eh? It's Hippo? Good night. <br> &gt;Sawatari: You too! ...Hey, do you want me to show you my new deck? <br> &gt;Yuya: It's Underworld Troupe! I already know that. I just want some sleep! <br>Holy fuck, I want to adopt Sawatari</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. You can see them in deviantart or rule34 as jkcs1611991. I have finished a Yuya one recently but haven't upload. For me, Yugo clothes is lewd to me so I am working on him as well. <br><br>Enjoy (from Chojirou)</br></br></br>  on the second episode of this anime, literally stunned at the amount of BS put on display rn<br>maybe i should've started with 5ds like everyone here said</br>  <br> literally stunned at the amount of BS put on display <br> Mfw shitters cant create whatever cards they want mid duel </br></br>  You guys, you guys.<br>What if... all the Ruris think they're Serena, because of memory rewriting??</br>  <br> any card i want will be made and it will acquire any effect necessary for it to survive in this duel <br>what is going on</br></br>    <br>Stop projecting strawman</br>  <br>yo nigga that post was two hours old. He's not even here anymore.</br>  <br>how do you know, are you stalking him? then you're creepy unless you're together in which case d'awww</br>  <br>Yo son I don't give a fuck  I honestly just wanted to bump the thread </br>  <br> Not liking degenerancy <br><br>Is like you don't like tanoshii in your duels</br></br></br>  <br>New croissant animal girls when.</br>  <br>Shun.</br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>  oremay  <br> Yuzu's look <br> She knows her Yuzus are smaller than Rin's Rins </br></br>  S-Shit ;_;  <br>Yuzu's yuzus are perfect.</br>  <br>Kenzan was another character I liked in GX. He was pretty bro tier and turning into a dinosaur in space was so retarded it was great.</br>  <br>I guess you're at the episode where I can finally ask this question<br><br>Why the fuck did literally no one carry Mystical Space Typhoon? If Jaden had used MST on Martin, he would have been able to prevent that duel from reaching such a shit hitting the fan level</br></br></br>  <br> Why the fuck did literally no one carry Mystical Space Typhoon? <br>Asuka uses it once, as do a couple other characters. But the answer is the same reason no one uses Solemn, or Dark Hole or any other staple. Nobody wants anime duels to be as homogeneous as real life duels</br></br>  <br>Yuzu!</br>  <br>Will Masumi ever become relevant again ;_;</br>  <br>She'll get killed by mega god Yuzu near the end of the show.</br>  <br>If they go back to Standard, maybe. It's a shame she never got to meet Serena.</br>  <br>She's going to get Shaddolls so she can eventually use Zefras.</br>  laddies aan gentremen<br>enterma duaelo</br>  <br>What mode will Masumi be in?<br> MUH YUZU <br> MUH HOKUTO <br> MUH MARCO-SENSEI <br> MUH HALIL THE FANBOY WHO YUZU WRECKED <br> MUH YUYA JUST TO TRY AND CUCK YUZU </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MUH KUROSAKI-SENSEI!</br>  <br>MUH HATE FOR ACADEMIA! EVERYTHING IS THEIR FAULT!</br>  Oh, man. Skulljoker makes Odd Eyes a great hidden boss in Performapal decks. All they need now is a tuner monster and I'll be able to run Meteorburst and Clear Wing, How long must I wait?  <br> Noble Dragon Magician </br>  <br>Not a preformapal, it'd fuck up the whole thing</br>  <br>Season 3 was fucking great man<br><br>I hate it when people get on Judai for the shit that happened with the whole Supreme King dimension and all. The motherfucker had a monster that fucked up all his friends, lived a life without his parents and his brother in the hospital, and went to Duel Academy so he can have fun duels. Now that monster comes and fucks up everything, takes away his friend, and when he wants to go save his friend, everyone joins even though he tells them all to fuck off.<br><br>It wasn't his fault everyone were so thirsty for some Judai that they went into dimension and all got massacred. They all went in with their own free will. Hell if they all hadn't come, they wouldn't have died and Judai wouldn't have turned into a Supreme King and rescue Johan without any problems.<br><br>Judai is the fucking hero we all need but don't deserve</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Current arc is about the conflict between Fusion, Synchro and Xyz <br> Fusion and Xyz hate each other <br> Synchro is currently neutral but sees Fusions and Xyzs are threats <br> Masumi, Hokuto and Yaiba are friends who each use the three summoning types. <br> Hokuto was kill first just like the Xyz Dimension. <br><br> I like candy. <br><br><br>Masumi should join Academia since they are Fusion users like her.  Except not really since Academia Fusions are better than LDS Fusions. <br><br>If you join, you get UNLIMITED FREE CANDY AND CHOCOLATE.  This is true. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shun will never be your dueling professor <br> he will never personally teach you how to rank-up <br> he will never show you his amazing rise falcon </br></br></br>    <br>Shun makes my falcon rise.</br>  <br>Why is Masumi so lewd?</br>   Only Dennis and Serena aren't mentioned in the summaries. <br> Gon was mentioned earlier this month in the magazine summaries. <br> he will join along with Shun to fight off Security. <br> Dennis is obviously escaping with Yuya and co. <br><br>How do they plan on getting Serena though? Will she be forgotten?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Brown and a bully.</br>  I love yugioh I play during recess with my friends  <br> you'll never get bullied by Masumi </br>  <br>Selena will be hiding in Shun's coat.</br>  <br>Masumi is the original crude strong girl.</br>  I found a torrent for Sound Duel 3 on nyaa, is it real?  Was getting the lancers caught part of Reiji's plan?  <br><br>Odd eyes with Mufflio and Partnaga is just great<br><br>I lile about pure Performapals that the vanilla Odd Eyes is the boss monster and not some evolution. Except maybe Beast Eyes. But even then Odd Eyes + Beast Monster usually does more attack</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  <br>No, but he'll act like it was and congratulate everyone for a job well done.</br>  <br><br> Anzu uses MST andnactually uses it to get rid of backrow <br> also runs Pot of Greed and Graceful Charity <br>   discards pot of greed for burn damage and doesn't use Graceful charity and considered it a dead draw </br></br></br></br>  It just hit me that Yuya's deck is rather good at dropping rank 4 xyz while Yuzu's has great fusion potential and Gong's all monster deck with such level variation makes it amazing for synchro summoning as he'll never run out of monsters. Was this planned?  <br>Judai had Solemn in S1 and Dark Hole was forbidden, yet the Einstein dude used it.</br>  <br> Was this planned? <br>Well yeah, they do plan the cards they plan to shill at least a few months in advance. That being said, only Gon was really heavily hinted at (that one superheavy soul that made a monster level 5 was a giant syncro sign). Yuyas deck has a lot of level 4s sure, but so do most decks. And IRL Meldoius were just a weird bad lockdown deck, while anime Melodius were nothing pretty much</br></br>  <br><br>I remember when people said that Yuya's deck would be shit at Xyz because the only level 4 he used to use were Whip Viper and Bugondola.<br><br>Also Yuzu's deck is a shit fusion deck. Her deck specializes on swarming from the hand. Both synchro and xyz would suit her so much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What if her fusions become contact fusions like beast eyes and the shitty neos fusions?</br>  <br>l-lewd</br>   tfw had a dream Serena was driving me around in an SUV <br> tfw she is a terrifying driver going 80mph around hairpin turns on a mountain fishtailing it thousands of feet above the ground <br><br>What the fuck have you guys and best Ruri done to me?</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya, at least, doesn't manage to escape.</br>  <br>When he brought out turtle and Chrono on the field against Chojiro, for half a second I thought he was going to r3 Xyz.</br>  <br>Don't make it sound dirty, you pervert. <br><br><br>Likely because in typical Yuya fasion, he got left behind trying to find Serena. Why are he and Yuzu such justicefags, their parents did way to good a job.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well in Serena's case she just wants people to recognize her and have some friends. <br><br>She's a poor lost soul trying to find her place.</br></br></br>   ____________ENJOY_______   YAMEROOOOO   UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH</wbr>   What is this guy?  Stop or she will be treated as M.  <br><br> Yuya and Serena are captured by Jean-Micheal and forced to compete in the Friendship Cup. </br></br>  <br>Treat her a whathever you want, I have a family to proudly take care of<br> On the other hand, based of what myths say about vampires I recommend you to let her be the dominant, just if you care about your life </br></br>  <br><br><br>Stop with the fucking jokes!</br></br></br>  <br>Implying Serena would need to be corsed into beating some faces in. Seriously, violence seems to be the only way to quill her Yuzu.wav. Just like Eago is for Yuya, maybe that's why those two are the easiest to manipulate in the Lancers.</br>  <br>I don't care, I really don't.<br>I only want to see how are they gonna handle Yuya and Yuzu reunion and how many episodes we need to wait. That and also consider bracelet-kun.</br></br>  <br>Well, it seems like it's Reiji who's forcing them to compete, specifically Yuya, since that really was said in the previews. It's all according to Reiji's KEIKAKU for Yuya to join the tournament, after all.<br><br>Serena doesn't get any mention though. Who knows what she'll be doing.</br></br></br>  Holy shit that's why he told you faggots to stay back home anyway<br><br>He keeps telling you to sit the fuck down and you guys keep following him like a lost puppy</br></br>  <br>It's sort of funny. Judai was the only one ever interested in the King of Games title, never won it, yet he's doing DBZ style fights and prince of persia shit in BBT.<br><br>Honestly I see Sawatari and Serena teaming up instead considering how brash they both are and want to prove themselves.</br></br></br>    What the fuck  <br> sorry guys </br>    <br>Judai stop speaking like one of your italian whores</br>  I just realized, Yuya is literally that guy who says "It's just a children's card game."  <br> Didn't paste for some reason </br>  <br> not watching the re-done subs with the dvd rips <br> VLC <br>Anon...<br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/125129<wbr>389/#q125140982</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>More like "You can tryhard but at least have fun with it"</br>  <br>They went to school to learn fucking card games and alchemy<br>They aren't the brightest bunch</br></br>  <br>Meanwhile we have Serena who thinks she's a Military Commander, Shun who thinks he's Che Guevara, and Reiji who thinks he's Batman.</br>   No cheating allowed card makes it against the rules to summon a bunch of monsters in one turn <br><br>Lmao.</br></br>  <br>Even Judai isn't that bright, didn't he forget the rules to the game half the time or what his cards even did?</br>  <br>Oh god I remember these fucking godawful subs<br> (They talk about going after them) </br></br>  <br> 0 seeders </br>  <br> (crowd not pleased with Judai's play) <br><br>Fucking kek</br></br></br>  <br>Even in Standard, which is the least edgiest dimension about the card game, people like Ishijima can gain a lot of fame and build wildly successful careers by simply beating others at duels enough times. Reiji and his mom manage to be leaders of the world in Standard simply by Leocorp controlling the card game and associated technology.</br>  <br> control hard-light technology <br> become masters of the world <br>Who woulda thunk it.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaibacorp was similar in having a lot of influence just for having power over the card game, even before Momentum. <br><br>And it's not like they actually use that insanely useful and versatile solid vision with mass technology for much of anything else but card games.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So hey if you're Reiji and his mom and Leo fucked off and you know he's gonna eventually come back with an invading force.<br><br>Why not, like. Use his company to make bombs.<br><br>Lots and lots and lots of bomb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaibacorp was already fuckhuge because of massive weapons deals and one of the largest corporations in the world<br>If anything Kaibacorp and Industrial Illusions just deciding to start pushing card games around the same time is what caused the world to be in the situations they're in during the show</br></br>  <br>Bombs don't stop magic monsters or the Pegasus card shadow realm.</br>  <br>Why do you think Reiji wanted Shun as an ally so bad?</br>  <br>This is correct. KaibaCorp used to be a military complex until Seto and Mokuba used their 51% ownership to drive Gozaboro out of the company, and then eventually Kaiba would completely convert the entire business out of military dealings into making card games solely to get revenge on an emo manlet for besting his real-death terminal.</br>  <br>You don't need to spend money manufacturing explosives when you can just print monster cards that attack using explosives.</br>  <br>Kaiba only took the company over to create Kaibaland for underprivileged children like he used to be and got all butthurt when his 'father' took his toys and games and shit.</br>  <br>Or trap cards that explode</br>  <br>What if<br><br>We used cards to make shit explode</br></br></br>   The prisoners shivering <br><br>FUCK. EVEN IN SYNCHRO I CAN'T ESCAPE</br></br>  <br>How did this nigga not kill Yusei with a fireball at point fucking blank range.</br>  <br>Because I don't know if you noticed but Divine is kind of stupid.</br>  <br>What if<br><br>We do it while on motorcycles to give them extra velocity</br></br></br>  <br>He was too busy taunting Yusei about how he's fucked Aki so many times and how Yusei isn't goung to fuck her ever.</br>  <br>Yeah he was evil to the point of being kind of retarded. Like, there was no reason for him to be such a cackling, maniacal cunt to Rua and Carly, but he does just because he hates normies so fucking much apparently? <br><br>But then, he won't even go all the way with it later. He could've just stone-cold murdered Mikage and Yusei but pussed out and decided to imprison them in some James Bond level shit instead.</br></br></br>  <br> Every time you stick it in, you'll be rubbing up against my dry, crusted semen! HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES, FUDO YUSEI?! </br>  <br>You fucked my bike? Not cool dude.</br>  <br> aki lost her virginity before starting high school <br> divine was the first to suck on her gigantic udders </br></br>  <br> Stick what in where now? </br>  <br>I wonder if he wrote her dad a thank you note for running her off.</br>  <br>He probably put her dad through one of his weird evil plans and blamed it on Aki so she'd get kicked out and he'd get to fuck her. <br><br>That seems like an overly complicated plan he'd do.</br></br></br>  <br>Except she ran away after nearly killing her dad and lighting their house on fire by forcing him to play the card game with her for once in his busy life.</br>  <br> Aki getting bitchslapped by her dad as a kid was actually Divine in a mask </br>  <br>Exactly. She was an unknowing pawn in his scheme.<br><br> Divine meets a young Aki and tells her to get better my dueling her dad <br> Divine lights their house on fire and makes it look like Aki <br> proceed to everything else <br><br>Aki also looks leagues better with her bangs down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally what are smoking. Divine had her join Arcadia after discovering her while she was homeless.</br>  <br>Divine was actually Madara the whole fucking time, I knew it.</br>  <br> inb4 Madaraposting </br>  <br>Just part of his overly complicated and overly evil plan. <br><br> tfw Divine turns out to be the final villain of Arc-V </br></br></br>  <br><br>Can any Yu-Gi-Oh! character beat Divine? And I'm not talking about episode 36 Divine, I'm talking about Episode 60 Divine, with Hinotama and Psycho Sword, his command phrases to release Aki's full power and put her under his control and can Synchro Summon Magical Android, Psychic Lifetrancer, Hyper Psycho Gunner and Mental Sphere Archfiend, can use Assault Mode Activate on Hyper Psycho Gunner to Special Summon Hyper Psycho Gunner/Assault Mode and can use Miracle Synchro Fusion on a Psychic-type Synchro Monster and a Psychic-type monster to Fusion Summon Ultimate Axon Kicker.</br></br>  It is fake card but at least it is not censored.  <br>Meh, it's impossible to pretend even for fun that psychic monsters aren't shit</br>  <br>I wish they hadn't have dropped the Arcadia Movement plot after Divine got nommed. Seeing him come back with something like this or better as his final boss would have been cool.<br><br>Thanks, sex cults.</br></br></br>  <br>Nearly every Signer had a reason to fucking despise him too. I really wish he could've come back so we could see them all just beat the shit out of him.</br>   In the Battle City arc, Joey's Deck is more balanced. He relies on Warriors again and incorporates Gamble cards that rely on coin flips, dice rolls or other games of chance and luck, "Graceful Dice" and "Skull Dice" being two such cards that become a permanent part of Joey's Deck. His reliance on these cards contrasts the other duelists in the series including Yugi and Kaiba, as Joey does not have access to the powerful cards <br>Dice soon</br>  <br>Red Eyes has also been pushed lately as well. <br><br>If anybody from DM ends up in Arc-V like Jack/Crow in limited fashion it'll be Jonouchi and Yuya having an EGAO duel. <br><br>Like how Fusion would likely have Ryo, and him and Shun would contrast.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Robo-Kaiba with BE supports.

The other guy takes it as Bold. Considering I've read and written the translation with a "dou" not "do", his name is probably Bordeux.</br>  <br>Eh, I have slight doubts about that, since the other color surnames have the kanji for the color in them. This one is pure hiragana.</br>  <br>Reira mindrape duel when?</br>  <br> Roger <br>What the fuck is with 5Ds land and western as fuck names?</br></br>  <br>It's Katakana. Katakana is used for borrowed words and foreign names.<br><br>But yeah, agree with it. The Synchro counterpart should have a Kanji-written name.

His strength falters and he stops walking. <br> Shirou looks down to shield his eyes from the sandstorm, and sees traces of someone else having been there (the place where Archer stopped). <br> Shirou breathes out and looks up. There's fake endurance in his expression, but it's full of hope. <br> Shirou walks away with a steady gait. <br> The camera lingers on the traces of Archer's presence, and watches Shirou leave as the shot ends. <br> (If you want to make it easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can add Archer appearing in that spot and watching Shirou off... but I think you shouldn't.) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always thought this series was garbage.

A series of events that started with her delivering a important essay that she wrote led to she and Rin falling from the London Tower. They survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Shirou. Eventually, she and Shirou who she calles Shero only to him amusingly became partners and started investigating a cruise ship casino called Fem's Casa.</br></br>  <br><br><br>P O T T E R Y<br>M I U R A <br>B A S E D<br><br>A<br><br>S<br><br>E<br><br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Some people expected Saber epilogue.</br></br></br>  <br> that sameface <br><br>takeuchi a shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Cherry blossoms and babies <br>I would stopped watching anime all together if they did this.<br><br>Nothing would surpass the feeling of seeing that animated.</br></br></br></br>  Can I get a link to the livewatch thread? I'm going to download the ep and want to feel as if I were watching it as it airs.  <br> Saber <br>No servants/tools/puppets allowed for the epilogue.</br></br>   all that key animation outsourcing for the 2nd cour <br><br>jesus ufotable really did fall apart sometime during winter</br></br>  <br>no</br>  I want to see pictures of Yuu Asakawa, Noriko Shitaya, and Kana Ueda hanging out now.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br> he thinks 92% for last episode is good </br></br>  <br>blame God Eater</br>  <br>Yup. Aias turned female just like Nero in extra.</br>  <br>Now I want to see two Shirou interacting in Illya manga where one dates Rin and other Sakura from Shirou housekeeper world leaving Luvia all alone with her money.</br>  <br> they're the same person, you fucking piss-ass idiot </br>    That smug.  <br>Now they just need to anime this chapter in Herz for full synergy.</br>  <br>Fate anime is for normalfags/old fans/otaku<br>Pic is for pedo/fat otaku</br></br>  Im so happy I did not rewatch it all this week.<br><br>I would be dead on the inside right now.</br></br>  <br>That's probably because Shirou can only project 4 petals on his own. Besides if that was Rho Aias, Shirou and Archer's projections would look like that instead of being a conceptual/magical shield.</br>    <br>Cool story bro.<br><br>Almost every episode in the 1st season had a higher score than this one.</br></br></br>  <br> Fate anime is for normalfags/old fans/otaku <br><br>Nice delusion.</br></br></br>  <br> Cool story bro <br><br>Holy shit i haven't read that on /a/ for years.</br></br></br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>I at least just want the time skip to be a few years later.

And taking Marisa's words to heart and selling out Sachie leads to becoming accepted by the Mamiya as an actual person and trusted household member, earning millions and getting to bully the servants along with them.</br></br>  <br>Too bad that one is a whore</br>  <br>I don't think Sachie is a bad person, just greedy. And she saved my ass in the end.</br>  Only when she's not a retarded shy moeblob.<br><br>aka never</br></br>  who  bestgirl  here?  <br>Sorry but futa girl is best.</br>  <br>Jesus christ gravity.</br>  <br>Heh.</br>  Anyone have a list of endings?<br><br>Don't feel like going through that FUCKING party scene.

I just wanted to give an example of a character that was the opposite of what was described earlier.</br>  <br>So you like drinking piss, huh?</br>  <br>I wish half her daily scenes would be given to the Futa instead</br>  <br>This game is shit.<br>Literally.</br></br>  What are your thoughts on  armpits  /v/?  Man, this game had so much potential.<br><br>It needed:<br>1) More futa scenes with Marika<br>2) Fewer or more optional scat scenes<br>3) More good endings. By my count, there's literally ONE good ending. There should have been a good and bad ending for each of the main girls.<br>4) A bigger variety of fetishes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  those tits <br>Someone needs to use a proper bra.</br></br>  <br/>    <br>but i want my 2d scat anon<br><br>That Marie toilet scene got me off like 4 times</br></br></br>  <br>It's fine to keep it in, but it got a bit repetitive.<br><br>Needed more ball busting, forced feminization, feet, pegging, fisting, and so on. I'm not even really huge into those fetishes but the game should have gone all out.</br></br></br>  <br>Im just waiting for Euphoria anon</br>  <br>5) Less boner killing old guys<br>6) Mamiya yuri incest scenes</br></br>  <br> rich white people </br>  <br>Old guys are a form of humiliation anon, you just don't get it.</br>  <br> Im just waiting for Euphoria anon <br>Does it have femdom?</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I understand completely, it's just something I personally hate.</br>  <br>Why the hell did Marisa have sex with a bunch of fat old men? That shit was so stupid.</br>  <br>To keep them coming back to parties in the future. It was strictly business.</br>  <br>These two are too good for euphoria.</br>  I love student council presidents who have glasses.  <br> teacher is voiced by Misonoo Mei <br><br>I can't wait.</br></br></br>  Is Euphoria getting an english translation/decensored or something?  <br> flat </br>  For some reason I hate glasses on girls but like them on guys.

She was just trying to make her senpai's dreams come true.</br></br>  The ending to the anime will be something like this:<br><br> Reina: I love you Taki-sensei <br> Taki-sensei: I don't know if I can ever love again after losing my wife, and I'm sure your feelings are just a schoolgirl crush. <br> Reina: No they aren't! I truly love you! <br> Taki-sensei:If you still feel the same way in 10 years, I will marry you. <br> 10 year timeskip <br> The day of Reina and Taki-sensei's wedding <br> Taki-sensei is 44 and Reina is 26 <br> The Kitauji High School band comes back together to play songs for the wedding <br> Kumiko and Shuichi's children are members of the audience <br> Final shot of the anime is Taki-sensei princess carrying Reina away for their honeymoon <br><br>Calling it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because crying anime girls is my fetish.</br>  <br>Responding to you from the last thread, it wouldn't be in Taki's character to make that sort of promise, as it's not one he can reasonably keep. He would have to not date anyone for 10 years.</br>  <br>Hmm... I didn't consider that, anon... shoujo endings often ignore that kind of thing in favor of creating a touching story, though, so it's okay.</br>  <br>Hibike isn't really shoujo and nothing about it would indicate such a silly ending to the series.</br>  <br>Maybe not from Kumiko's perspective, but Hibike has been nothing but a shoujo for Reina</br>  BD Vol 1 has subs now. Also pic related  <br>I worry about you sometimes Taki shipper.<br> It'll still end in Narita divorce. </br></br>  <br>Fuck off you fujoshit, and rot away with FujoAni, you both seem to hate small girls just alright.</br>  <br>Reina's love is the greatest one.</br>  <br>A better question is why is the drama so forced.<br><br> SO... THIS IS WHAT SHE FELT THAT DAY!!! KUYAASHIIIIIIIII!! NOW I TRULY UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELS REINA!! NOW GIVE ME YOUR SOUND! EUPHONIUM! <br><br>Come the fuck on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 2 Eyecatch</br>  <br>What? I didn't think it was forced at all. We've had like 4 goddamn episodes of build up where Kumiko was shown admiring Reina more and more, and now she's realizing that she's becoming more like Reina. Makes total sense.</br>  <br>Its bait anon.</br>  <br> smug faggotts </br>  <br> I'll marry you if you can get into Tokyo University <br> Reina hasn't been studying at all, only playing the trumpet  <br>Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I was being pretty serious. These fucking girls overthink everything too fucking much.<br><br> NEE-CHAN QUIT EUPHO...? WHY!? SHE LOVED EUPHO!! SHOULD I QUIT IT TOO?? NO... I LOVE EUPHO AND KUYASHIIIIIIIIII <br><br>Everything is forced. The drama more than anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> even more smug and now staring right at me </br>  You'll never be a 34 year old teacher with this cutie lusting after your dick and hand in marriage.<br><br>Assuming you wait until she graduates, that'll be 36 and 17 years old respectively. <br><br>19 years old age difference, back of the net. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEl<wbr>5RvbGdik</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Taki is one lucky son of a bitch.<br>Also Reina is 16, so Taki would be 35.</br></br>  Like a dream  <br>Do you really not see the parallels between Aoi, Kumiko, and Kumiko's sister, or are you actually just baiting?</br>  <br>She played trombone though. <br>Anyway, I can understand the dilemma. Why be in band when you're not going to do anything with it in the future? Studying would be more useful. In the last episode she's seemed to have resolved that she's in it because she indeed loves playing the euphonium. She's not in it because she admired her sister or had nothing better to do, she loves to play music and that's reason enough to be in band.</br></br>  What happened to her smile again? I'm pretty sure that the situations established at the beginning of the episode were resolved at the end of the episode.  <br>Hey bud, guess what. It's an anime series based on a book series aimed at teenage girls. Go watch Death Note or something if you want something a little more intellectually stimulating.</br>  <br><br>Middle schooll band drama, Sister giving up band, and Shuichi calling her ugly.</br></br>  <br> ep 13 starts <br> kumiko wakes up <br> its the morning of her middle school competition <br> with newfound passion and creative spark she's able to take her school to the next round.  <br> her and Reina hagu after getting the real gold <br> "lets become special" <br> quick reconciliation with Shuichi before she's welcomed home by her sister </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And this is what disappoints me: all you want is void entertainment, you don't want something that'll make you think. At the end of the day, all you want if your fucking cute little girls doing cute shit.</br>  <br><br> Shuichi calling her ugly. <br><br>He never apologize didnt he? What a dick.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He is indeed a total weiner.</br></br>  <br>Oboe looks deeper in despair.</br>  That was painful to watch. Too much tears in this show.  <br>bwuaaha</br>  <br>I like how you responded to the guy who basically said "it's just stupid don't worry about it" instead of the other two who actually answered your question.</br>  <br>TYBKA</br>  <br><br><br>The anime skipped his apology to make Kumiko pissy about him.</br></br></br>  Better stomp the fuck out of him.  <br><br>Remember when Shuichi lightly punched Kumiko on the back for ignoring him? Yup Motherfucking parallels man.</br></br>  <br>Makes me think they intentionally altered his scenes for this.</br>  <br>When was that again?</br>  <br>I remember Kumiko is having in trouble with her fingering, and is walking around like a crazy person playing the air euphonium. Pretty sure its right before he asks her to festival.</br>  kyoani will never have a better MC  <br>They remade Kyon once, they can do it again.</br>  <br>Railway station.</br>  yfw Episode 13 ends with "So the next piece begins" with a focus shot on Oboe-chan as someone calls her by name  Hibike:<br>#3: 中野 (Nakano ___)<br>#7: 高橋 沙里 (Takahashi Sari)<br>#27: 石上 (Ishigami _____)<br>#26: 野口 (Noguchi _____) &lt;--- Is she related to Hideri?<br>#57: 臼井 (Usui)<br>#60: ___ 川 ___子 (___kawa ____ko)<br>#42: 日 ___ 子 ____ (Nichi____ ___ko)<br>#49: 古木 のぞみ (Furuki Nozomi)<br>#21: Yoshizawa Akiko<br>#17: Kabe Tomoe<br><br>Sorry guys.

There'll be names all over the place.</br>  <br>That's why its threads have so much deep, insightful discussion going on, right?</br>  <br>Woah dude, no need to be rude. This person and their friend took a lot of time to translate these names.</br>  <br>She spoke in episode 11. It's possible some seiyuufag could recognize her.</br>  <br><br>I like how Shuichi and Kumiko scenes are subtle and well done.</br></br>  <br>It could be, but the constant yuri-baiting cheapens the experience.</br>  <br>There's 0 correlation between what /a/ threads are like and what shows are like.</br>  <br> took a lot of time <br>No wonder they did such a great job. It shouldn't "take a lot of time" to read names.</br></br>  <br>Translation: "I don't like yuri."</br>  <br>Really? I don't think I've ever heard #57 talk before.</br>  <br>I like yuri though, this is yuri baiting.</br>  <br> read names <br>There's a difference between translating and reading. I'm pretty sure the former takes more time to do.</br></br>  <br>This happens all the time. Whether the show is good or bad, if it has a lot of people interested in it a lot of back-to-back threads will be made. People run out of things to talk about. Then people talk about nothing/shitpost/argue over stupid things. This is why generals are so looked down upon. Even so, if a thread exists people will want to come and hang out.</br>  <br>Show: two girls become close because they understand and admire eachother, with a bit of playful flirty stuff occasionally mixed in because they're teenagers.<br><br>/a/: Fucking yuri-baiting, kyoani lost their way.<br><br>Why is erotic lust the only kind of love /a/ understands?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never heard of a seiyuu with the surname Noguchi before.

They'll probably even have Reina encourage Kumiko instead. She already did it during auditions.</br></br>  <br>They'll probably make a scene to bait out reactions which gets misunderstood that Reina was jealous of Taki for spending time with Kumiko.</br>  <br>End scene being the flower bulb in Kumiko's room blooming and being a lily.</br>  <br>Or a yellow rose.Flower language for friendship.</br>  <br> yuri bait <br>but Reina had her hands on Kumiko, she couldn't stop hugging her. Also pic related.</br></br>  <br>Pic related is subtext, not bait.</br>  <br> Given literally everything else in all three novels prior where we're given Kumiko's POV, there's nothing that hints she has any feelings for him more than friendship outside of one vague line in the epilogue for novel 3 <br><br>Kumiko's reaction to Hazuki and Shuuichi's date in novel 1:<br><br> "Hazuki-chan's been like that for a while now." <br><br> Sapphire lowered her voice as she responded. <br> "She's going to the festival with the person she likes today. And she's planning to confess to him." <br><br> "Oh man, youth on full display! Gives me heartburn just hearing about it!" <br> Natsuki's face clearly twisted. Her voice was pretty loud, but Hazuki gave no reaction. Somehow, she couldn't hear a thing. <br><br> That "person she likes" was no doubt Shuuichi. In an attempt to turn her attention away from the conversation, Kumiko let out a small sigh. She felt a little sick. As if something in her stomach was bubbling up, a muddy sort of feeling began to well up inside her. And as if it was able to course though every one of her veins, the feeling began to spread throughout her body. As if in an attempt to cool the fever that had accumulated in her fingertips, Kumiko gripper her euphonium tightly. I don't like this. I really don't. She couldn't quite explain why, but the thought simply drifted through her mind. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JUST<br> ;_; </br></br>  We all desire to get good. <br><br><br>No, you stupid mong, the whole river practice and bridge scene is a lead up to the cheering up scene.<br><br>Fucking cock mongler, get your head set straight. Fucking communists. <br><br><br>A good thing Shuichi turned down Hazuki. A true capitalist only strives for true love.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A true capitalist <br>What?</br></br>  <br>A true capitalist indeed.</br>  <br><br>Kyoani will always find a way to insert yuri bait even if it's at the expense of other characters.</br></br>  <br> Fucking communists <br> A true capitalist <br><br>anon are you ok</br></br></br></br>  <br>So Natsuki and Asuka speak Kansai-ben in the novels? Can't remember hearing any Kansai-ben in the anime.</br>  <br>Yes they dropped it unfortunately.</br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere that everyone except Kumiko speaks Kansai-ben, since she's a filthy immigrant.</br>  <br>That would be fucking hell to do in the anime.</br>  <br>Northern voice actors have done kansai-ben before though, it's not exactly impossible.</br>  <br>What I mean is having 1-2 characters is fine, but everyone expect MC speaking in Kansai-ben looks weird to me.</br>  <br>But they're in Kansai. Do you also find it odd for e.g. Irishmen to speak with Irish accents?</br>  <br>Waiting anxiously for another anime to go full Saki.</br>  <br>Well fair enough. It's just that I don't remember a anime where the whole cast speaks in Kansai-ben.</br>  <br>It's not like it'd be that weird, lovely complex did something similar with a different accent iirc.</br>  <br> unfortunately. <br>You mean fortunately.</br></br>  <br> Waiting anxiously for another anime to go full Saki. <br>A bunch of kanto actresses faking accents?</br></br>  <br>No, I think it's sex</br>  <br>You bet. Fake accents in a language I can't understand are my favorite.</br>      <br><br>Sasuga Kyoani.<br><br> At least change the file name, faggot </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> maximum yuribait <br> tumblr <br>Sasuga.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>Can't see kumifeet due to shit scan.<br>Fix this.</br></br>  <br>Reina sharing her skincare routine to help a girl out</br>  <br><br><br>Why can't they just make them the official pair? Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that'd be gay.</br>  <br>Because KyoAni is not filled with raging homosexuals. Hopefully. </br>  Those two really have the most awkward friendship.  <br>Because Reina loves Taki-sensei.</br>  <br>They are in your heart, Anon.</br>  <br>The more I see promo art featuring Reina and Kumiko getting intimate, the more I get mad at Kyoani for not having the guts to ship them. I really hope they reconsider after all the positive feedback from the fans and make a S2 with them as the end pairing.</br>  Is that lip gloss she's putting on her?  <br> no regrets <br>Shine on, you crazy diamond.</br></br>  <br>Its just bait, but I do think the animators likes drawing them together.</br>  <br> the animators <br>Yeah, because they're definitely the ones in control of what gets drawn.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it will very likely happen.<br>Hetfags are on the wrong side of history.</br></br>  <br> character does something I disagree with and doesn't do what I wanted/expected them to <br> wow what a shit character <br>I bet you hated Yura too you mongrel.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this a real tweet? I won't be fooled by your lies, internet.</br>  <br><br>I know it's bait and that's why I'm upset. They compliment each other so well, Reina is the reason why Kumiko starts liking music again. They inspire and encourage each other. It all makes sense. Replace Shuichi with a rock and the show would still be the same. They should have never added his character.</br></br>  Am I the only one who wants Shoeboy to win?  <br> https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/sta<wbr>tus/614490471558033408</wbr> </br>   yuri show <br> no yuri <br><br>Why does KyoAni always do this to us?</br></br></br>  <br>The tweet is %100 real.</br>  <br>Technically everyone in Haruhi should speak Kansai-ben too.</br>  <br>His character does inspire her. Have you not watch the last episodes?</br>  <br> all that grease </br>  <br>Crunchyroll's twitter is a fool.</br>  <br>I like his interactions with GEH, they are cute and not kind of creepy like half of hers with Reina.</br>  <br>Time to die.</br>  <br>It's real but it's really just CR baiting a bit</br>  <br><br>No, it's Reina that inspires her. She's even the one she calls at the middle of the night to seek comfort. I will be angry if they suddenly make Kumiko like Shuichi at the final episode. It is shit writing and a fucking asspull.</br></br>  <br>Still not as bad as the "we did it!" when Free was announced.</br>  <br>It's like watching someone ignorant of everything behind the show and just watching it without posting in any discussions. They'd think it was gay and they'd be none the wiser to know it isn't. It's sort of pure, innocent, in its ignorance.</br>  <br>But she doesn't like Reina that way and she likes Taki anyway.<br>She was so fucking butthurt at him about what he said to her in their last year of middle school she even changed her hairstyle, that's love.</br></br>  <br>She will go to Tokyo Uni I'm sure.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit you cant possibly be real.</br></br>  <br>More legit than pretending she's in love with Reina or something.<br>Even the source material is against you.</br></br>  <br> She was so fucking butthurt at him about what he said to her in their last year of middle school she even changed her hairstyle, that's love. <br>I don't hate the shoe and I don't deny she ends up with him in the novels but that's retard logic</br></br>  <br>There's very few people left here on /a/ who still expect a yuri end, so there shouldn't be too much of a shitstorm when the anime ends here.<br><br>But I can only imagine how bad it's going to be everywhere else where everyone seems certain Kumiko and Reina are a couple.</br></br></br>  <br>Reina isn't the only one that inspired her though, seeing Shuuichi work hard also made Kumiko want to as well. Look I get being angry at the bait. But Kumiko does care about Shuuichi, he does inspire her. They are going to have their scene together next ep, maybe it will be romantic maybe not. But the episodes have been building up for them to reconcile their relationship in the final ep. Kumiko and Shuuichi don't get together until the end of the 3rd novel anyway.</br>  <br>Because it's nothing but shameless cheap bait.</br>  <br><br>Its an adaptation where they haven't been shy to change or ditch entirely the source material when it suited them. What matters is what's on the screen, and Reina is on screen with Kumiko a hell of a lot more than Shoe is, and in far more intimate situations.</br></br>  <br>You're right, this is much worse than that.</br>  As much as I hate to say this<br>Kumiko and Shuuichi as a couple is a given and pretty obvious, you have to be really delusional to still believe she might end up with Reina at this point, especially after the last episode</br>  <br>  Especially after the last episode <br>What the fuck are you talking about</br></br>  <br><br>I will lose respect for Kyoani if they make it romantic. There is no build-up, the attraction is one-sided and they don't even have good chemistry.<br><br>Also, I prefer if Reina confesses to Taki and he denies her early so that a Kumiko-Reina is possible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one gives a shit about what you or anyone thinks.</br>  <br> Its an adaptation where they haven't been shy to change or ditch entirely the source material when it suited them. <br>On the contrary, it's an adaption where they HAVE been shy to ditch the source material. If they wanted to go anime original yuri, they never would've included the hints that Shu1 wants to get it on with Kumiko, nor Reina's Taki crush. When it comes down to it, they still tried to stay true to the spirit of the story as they well should.</br></br>  <br><br>Almost no one here thinks RxK will happen, but ShoexKumiko isn't "obvious" it's functionally undeveloped in the show.</br></br>  <br>Did you not see how Reina reacted when she heard Kumiko spent time with Taki-Sensei?</br>  <br> being this mad <br>it just won't happen, give up really</br></br>  <br>No one is deluded. People just prefer a ship. I don't think many even care about end game at this point.</br>  <br>are you blind or something?</br>  <br>Now that's just delusion.</br>  <br>to be fair that can be interpreted in many ways. and honestly you would have to be retarded if you think someone is stealing your crush even when they have shown no signs of being interested in them</br>  <br>Because you deserve to be blueballed for all eternity.</br>  <br>Because the only good thing about her is her disappointment voice</br>  <br>Kumiko deserves nothing</br>  <br><br> Almost no one here thinks RxK will happen <br><br>I think it's possible if there's another season. Kumiko-Reina sells they'll make the proper adjustments. Nobody literally cares about Shuichi. It would be great if they make Reina confess to Taki-sensei and gets rejected at the end of this season. I'd throw them all of my money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So she doesn't realize what she wants is right in front of her. She's a girl with a crush. Whatcha gon' do.<br><br> inb4 "but it's so much MOOOOOOOOORE" </br></br></br>  <br> to be fair that can be interpreted in many ways <br>Not really.<br>I'm sure some people grasping at straws would try to interpret it as Reina being jealous because Kumiko was with a man at night, but those are diehard shippers. Reina has never shown to be even remotely jealous over Kumiko being with other people, and it makes no sense in the context of their relationship.</br></br></br>  <br> The anime skipped his apology to make room for yuribait to get yuribucks <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>Not even her own euphonium san?</br>  <br>What does that have to do with Kumiko and Shuichi</br>  <br>There are hints everywhere in the show, it's not as evident because Kumiko is still realizing her feelings</br>  <br>It means that the last episode clearly showed that Reina is still madly in love with Taki-Sensei and doesn't think of Kumiko as a possible love interest.</br>  <br>reina is just a schoolgirl with a crush, she probably wants to know if taki said anything about her. i mean who gets jealous over someone spending time with someone else even i they don't much care about them.<br>lets be honest that it wasn't that good of a scene anyway</br></br>  <br>There are a few small moments, but the two have only had two or three scenes with each other. Shu is underdeveloped as a character in general, and their relationship is almost nonexistent save for their past relationship.</br>  <br> actually believing KyoAni gives a shit about butthurt western fan response </br>  <br>At least the novel made it more obvious.</br>  <br>No, euphonium-san would be better with Amethyst</br>  <br>Everybody likes them, not just the west. Just look at pixie.</br>  <br>I wonder if we'll see Aoi in the audience.</br>  <br> i mean who gets jealous over someone spending time with someone else even i they don't much care about them. <br>Reina does.<br>Her entire personality can literally be summed up as "muh taki".</br></br></br>  <br>Novel 2 shows Reina depress because she thinks the new adviser is going out with Taki. Who is also Taki's friend from college. <br><br>I'm sorry but she gets jealous very easily, and can become yandere.</br></br></br>  <br>She'll have a ticket, stand outside the concert hall for a half hour, then walk home.</br>  <br> I wonder if we'll see Aoi in the audience. <br>She will most likely. She's Haruka's friend after all.</br></br>  <br> you will never see that being animated </br>  i honestly don't want shu to win the kumikobowl just because he's so undeveloped as a character. i mean what do we know about him, he's the worst trumpet player and he wants to improve. if they gave him some more development i wouldn't mind but if they get together it will be one hell of an asspull  <br>Good job cherry picking that last frame. Reina looks interested or concerned in that scene, not jealous, and the way the scene cuts out at the end is pretty clear evidence that nothing of note happens during it.</br>  <br>She even breaks her glass cup cause it makes her blood boil.</br>  <br>looks like she picked the wrong week as we have a defective Nagato that can't save her!</br>  <br> what is Class S? <br><br>being obsessed with genuine homosex or "queer representation" is a thoroughly western phenomenon<br><br>that's why you don't see Kyoani twitter fellate shibuya legislation, but CR twitter co-opting eupho to promote American gay marriage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the joke <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> your head </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Reina looks interested or concerned in that scene, not jealous, <br>Are you serious? She literally drops her wattle bottle, freezes for a few moments, then stops listening to what Kumiko is saying to make her talk more about what happened with Taki-Sensei.<br><br>What do you think was the point of this scene?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He plays trombone, and he's not that bad. He just started playing it. He swapped from french horn. <br><br>He has some development but I don't think Kumiko will get with him in this final episode. In the novel they only got together at the end of novel 3. I can only guess that there scene will just cause Kumiko to finally see him in a different light. You know see him as a boy not a friend.</br></br></br>  <br>She is about to join Kaori as a sinful Haibane.</br>  <br>I've read your post twice and I've come to the conclusion that I have no idea what you intended that response to mean.</br>  <br>ターキー？</br>  <br>I don't think these were small moments, you just need to see the look in her eyes when seeing Shuichi trying to get better, and how Kumiko reacted to Hazuki's confession to get how tsun she is<br>the yelling scene, and the river scene only make it even more obvious</br></br>  I can't believe people can deny the truth this goddamn hard.<br>The original source is goddamn exist, read it and end this useless debate already. Or ask the author directly or shit just DO something because this is getting annoying.</br>  <br> What do you think was the point of this scene? <br>Showing that she was surprised? Regardless, it's clear that this event probably isn't going to lead to any drama, otherwise it would have actually been focused on.</br></br>  <br> what is class S? <br><br>Something this board thinks about far more than any Japanese discussion I've seen ever has. A cute couple is a cute couple; nobody drawing the tons of Kumirei art is thinking about that in the slightest.</br></br></br>  <br> they don't even have good chemistry <br><br>You don't like the gehs anon?</br></br></br>  <br> You know see him as a boy not a friend. <br>I don't know what makes you think the story is heading this way.</br></br>  <br>yuri fanart on pixiv does not equate interest in actual lesbian couples is what it means<br><br>Class S is a concept among japs and not what westerners like you want<br><br>Kyoani is working within that concept and won't give you lesbians because neither they nor their fans actually give a shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone knows about the source already, and they've all decided if they care or not too. This point is meaningless.</br>  <br>But didn't you hear anon, the author was forced by publishers to have a normal het ending. KyoAni is reworking the story to fit the original vision.</br>  <br>Kaori is a saint.</br>  <br>No, it was to show once again that she's completely obsessed with Taki-Sensei.<br><br>They can show her being concerned about Kumiko without the yandere vibes they use exclusively for Taki-Sensei.</br></br></br>  <br> yuri fanart on pixiv does not equate interest in actual lesbian couples is what it means <br>I guess you're right. There's nothing gay about the fanart at all, really.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why was the scene cut short?</br>  <br> hurr what is IRC fucking up the place <br> what are crossboarders shitposters from /v/  <br><br>Please anon, end yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why this whole damn thing is fucking retarded.<br><br>Source pls. I want actual source, something that really legit, coming from the author itself, nit baseless rumor from 2ch or 2chan.</br></br></br>  <br>God dammit, is the novel translated? My moonrunes level doesn't allow me to read kanji unless there's furigana</br>  <br>Kumiko wasn't tsun during the yelling scene. She was genuinely upset because of what happened in band. The River scene was more about how they are becoming friends again. Again they aren't gonna get together in the last episode. But they will fix their friendship and hopefully give a hint of Kumiko's feelings towards him.</br>  <br>But it wasn't? It clearly showed that she's still obsessed with Taki-Sensei. There was no need to make it any longer than it already was. They're not planning on making the next episode have some kind of drama between Kumiko and Reina.</br>  <br>stay salty but it won't change anything<br><br>Kyoani literally does not care for your queer crusade and they won't make them canon lesbians to satisfy western "progressives"</br></br></br>   Ribbons did nothing wrong   Guys could we stop the discussion for a moment to agree on the universal miracle that is Peace-chan?  <br> That's why this whole damn thing is fucking retarded. <br>No, because many have decided that they don't care about the source material. So they want other evidence to convince them.</br></br>  <br>You're so delusional you qualify as an Akibaranger.</br>  <br> you just need to see the look in her eyes when seeing Shuichi trying to get better <br>You're reaching.<br> and how Kumiko reacted to Hazuki's confession <br>Which never happened in the anime.<br> how tsun she is the yelling scene <br>There is no dere.<br> and the river scene only make it even more obvious <br>You're reaching. Again. In fact, isn't this the same reaching you did already?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Source pls. <br>Anon was being sarcastic. That's a rumor invented by butthurt yurifags who'll grasp at any straw to deny the reality in front of their eyes.</br></br>  <br> But it wasn't? <br>What? They literally cut the scene while the two are still talking.</br></br>  <br>who?</br>   mfw animesuki <br><br>I want to see these faggots bitch and whine by the end of the show.</br></br>  Can't wait for Kumiko Love Story movie, /a/  <br>Yes she did   she choosed to wear that ugly ribbon  </br>  <br>There is a difference to seeing a friend who is a guy, as either a friend or a boy. Once you start to see your friend as a boy and not a friend. It means you notice his looks and start to have feelings for him. It happens a lot between a girl and boy friendship. its the same in reverse when the guy starts to see his female friend as a girl.</br>  <br>The whole fanbase are just idiots.</br>  <br>The point of that scene was to show Reina's yandere tendencies for Taki-Sensei.<br>The point of that scene was not to have drama based on a misunderstanding. That's why the misunderstanding was resolved off-screen like five seconds later.</br></br>  <br> salty <br>Yes. Project more. Use buzzwords more. It feeds me. NOM NOM.<br><br> Kyoani literally does not care for your queer crusade <br>And you base this on?<br>Also..<br> your queer crusade <br> projecting again <br>NOM NOM.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Peace-chan <br> Miracle <br>Pic related is the only miracle.</br></br></br>  Time for bestsuki  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br>Mikino.</br>  <br>Holy flipping fuck, I know what the phrase means, Anonymous. I asked you what made you think they were going to incorporate something like that into the last episode.</br>  <br>No one is salty, people just ship what they want.</br>  <br>That's still weird to use<br><br>Right fagott.</br></br></br>  <br>a.k.a. 2nd</br>  <br>Absolutely</br>  <br>She's a bitch, I can tell just by looking at her.</br>  <br>You're a bitch. I can tell by the way you type.</br>  <br> No, because many have decided that they don't care about the source material. <br>You can decide you don't care about source material, but that doesn't make source material any less important.</br></br>  <br>You shut your whore mouth</br>  There are hints that Kumiko may like Shuichi but it's subtle since Kyoani downplayed it but it's there still there.  <br>I just wanted someone to post that image since I can't seem to find it on my folder.<br>Thank you anon, you have splendid taste.</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck talks like this? Jesus</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  All the threads are the same. All. The. Threads. Just where did we go so wrong?  <br>It doesn't matter how important it actually is, all that matters is perception.</br>  <br>50% of her face is eyes. Why is this allowed?</br>  <br> but that doesn't make source material any less important. <br>The way KyoAni's chosen to adapt it does, however.</br></br>  <br>HTH, /a/non</br>  <br> Mikino <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>Some people like to argue rather than post pictures of they're waifu. It can't be helped, Anonymous.</br>  <br>In the novel during that scene his smile makes her feel at ease and calms her down, then after staring at him for a while she notices and then steps on his foot out of anger. <br><br>That's the scene where she'll look at him like a boy before getting defensive. Though in the anime I do think they are gong to replace foot step for something else.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say it's that subtle - There's just very little of it.<br><br><br>They're basically  generals , so they were doomed from the get-go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naw, that's not gay, it's just Cool Biz.</br>  <br>By following the story 99% faithfully and adding a couple more fanservice scenes that amount to nothing?</br>  Kind of weird they left the percussions for the last ep.  <br><br>Episode 8 - 9 has some. Also the fact that Kumiko really took to heart Shuichi's comment about her is already a big hint.</br></br>  <br> Sakai literally failing bashing two things together <br>And some people say she's best.</br></br>  <br>Because it's anime, and a KyoAni show at that. If you want realistic faces go to /tv/ or watch something like that rotoscoped show from a couple years ago.  I already forgot its name </br>  <br>They're saving best girl for last. <br>I think they may have been going in order. Drums are way in the back of band.</br></br>  <br>I can't think of a single scene between Shuu and Kumiko that has been remotely similar to one they had in the novels since he asked her to go to the festival in episode 8. And even that was pretty different. You're in an uphill battle if you're basing your argument on "it happened in the novels".</br>  <br>Certain Kyoani fans have been in to homolust for a while now, and everybody on /a/ is autistic. <br><br>Fuck, we have an anon here arguing that a scene cut meant something other than inserting humor into his AoTS.</br></br></br>  <br> following the story 99% faithfully </br>  <br>Percussions don't participate in tuning. They tune their own way.</br>  <br> There's nothing gay about the fanart at all, really. <br>Imminent Kumiko gangrape confirmed, the fanart on pixiv has spoken.</br></br>  <br>What major plot points were changed?</br>  <br> those boobs <br>WHEN WILL THOSE MONKEYS STOP?</br></br>  <br>A couple. But I see no reason to spoonfeed your goalpost-moving request.</br>  <br>Maybe they'll just put Taki-sensei as conductor for the last ep since percussion instruments are shit and irrelevant.</br>  <br>pedophilia is illegal now, it can't be helped</br>  Kyoanus obviously left Kumiko x Shuichi hints as vague and open for interpretation, this is probably to bait people on Kumiko x Reina and make it seem credible. But we know at this point that it's all bait and so we disregard it. Now what's left are Kumiko x Shuichi hints. They can always say look 'she likes him all along' and those scenes were supposed to be interpreted this way.  <br> feet  touching when</br>  <br>I have faith in the Yamada. Ep 13 will be great and it would suck because that's the last thing we'll get.</br>  <br>So you're talking out of your ass and have no argument.<br>Alright, shitposter.</br></br>  <br>The point is I don't have to prove anything to you when you run your mouth about some 99% nonsense when you obviously don't know what the fuck your talking about.<br>And you call me the fucking shitposter?</br></br>  <br>I don't expect a yuri bait scene like the episode 11 one in the last episode exactly because Yamada is directing it.<br><br>She handled Midori in Tamako pretty tastefully, I would be disappointed if she resorted to cheap fanservice this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Novelfag here.<br>If anyone is wondering why Asuka has those hints of darkness:<br> Her mother is abusing Asuka. She tries to force her to quit the band and focus on studies. Bitch even hits her in presence of Taki when she says that she is not going to quit the band. Her genki attitude is just a mask and music a way of escaping from her shitty life  </br></br></br>  <br> Spoiler <br>What a great lady.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty obvious Asuka has good reasons for being obsessed, but man those are some unpleasant reasons.</br>  <br>Yup. She might be the only sane person still in KyoAni. But I really want a new original movie by her.</br>  <br><br>   Her mother is abusing Asuka <br><br> t-the sexual abuse kind? </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm calling you a shitposter because all you're doing is posting epic reaction images and refusing to clarify on any points you're trying to imply.<br><br>So yes, you're a shitposter.<br><br>All the major plot points in anime and in the novel are exactly the same. Some scenes were changed and made open for interpretation, but it doesn't affect the story itself. All the major events that happen in novel also happen in the anime.<br><br>Do you want me to write you a synopsis of this show so far, in case you're just a shitposter who isn't even watching it and just posting in these threads?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bitch deserves it for not listening.</br>  <br><br>Goddamn shit's getting real. Season 3 please kyoni. No wonder her room is shit.</br></br>  <br>And people doubted that she's best girl.</br>  <br>Not directing it, but storyboarding it.</br>  <br>The eyecatches were pretty much in score order, although flutes are usually before clarinets and horns before trombones. Maybe they score it differently in Japan?</br>  <br>Didn't she direct an early episode though? As well as helped with episode 8.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>That's good right? As she storyboarded any other episodes.</br>  <br>All I know is that she storyboarded episodes 1 and 4 and directed episode 1.</br>  Why does kyoani hate the gays  <br>Episode one was pretty good. it introduced all the characters. That scene where Kumiko recognized Reina was hilarious and the Kumiko and Shuuichi scene was cute.</br>  <br><br>They don't. They actually love them since they're good marketing material.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you hate gays ?</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Those episodes were the most accurate following the novel. I have faith in Yamada.</br>  <br>Fine. Since you're obviously begging at this point, I'll spoonfeed you. <br><br> All the major plot points in anime and in the novel are exactly the same.  <br>You see, this is you moving goalposts. Major plot points != 99% the same as the fucking novel. If you made an anime about a girl name Kumiko who plays euphonium in a brass band, then you're not changing the major plot points. never mind the fact that you can add things like her also knowing magic and owning a talking familiar. The main plot points still haven't changed.<br><br> Some scenes were made open for interpretation <br>What the fuck does this even mean. This is how I know you're full of shit. Creating new scenes from scratch isn't leaving things for interpretation. Cutting scenes entirely isn't leaving things for interpretation. Changing personalities isn't leaving things for interpretation. <br><br> but it doesn't affect the story itself.  <br>The story itself doesn't matter. It's your ridiculous claim that you know how much of the show is accurate to the source when you fucking don't. You just don't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't that episode 1 disregard Shuchi's apology and made Kumiko fixated on Reina?</br></br>  <br>Yuri subtext is good for all cause waifu fans like it so they can see the girls in different almost romantic situations to see how they react still staying safe that they might be into them too, and yuri fans take it as granted.<br><br>While yuri canon means the girls aren't into waifu otaku and prefer girls for real which alienates big part of the male audience.<br>It's similair in western media(comics, games, movies), bisexual girls are welcomed, lesbians are not, cause they don't make good joke characters like gay men, and don't want to do it with guys like bi girls usually always do.<br><br>And as most important reason yuri fans buy too little to matter compared to let say yaoi fangirls.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohh right. So it was her idea to make Kumiko fixated on Reina. Episode 13 is going to have altered scenes isn't it.</br>  <br>I tried to tell you she was best girl, but would you listen?</br>  <br><br>I want to buy her stuff and also a proper bed.</br></br>  <br>In my point of view i get TWO waifus for the price of one and angsty smelly underachiever emo male gook teenager</br>  <br> having faith in the biggest yurifag at KyoAni not to add more bait in the last episode <br>You got to be kidding.</br></br>  <br>Why do you hate the straights?</br>  <br>She made Mochizou x Tamako happen. I don't she will do bad yuribait, but still Shuuichi/Kumiko.</br>  <br> Fine. Since you're obviously begging at this point, I'll spoonfeed you.  <br>I wasn't begging, I was giving you the chance to prove you're not just a shitposter. If I needed spoonfeeding I would not have written the last line of that post.<br><br> Major plot points != 99% the same as the fucking novel. <br>Yes it does, you fucking retard. That's the whole crux of the argument. Literally not even the most faithful adaptation in the world is 99% the same, it was a colloquial term that nothing major has changed.<br><br> What the fuck does this even mean. <br>The storyline and character relations are the same.<br>Kumiko and Shuichi have a strained but close relationship. Hazuki falls in love with Shuichi and goes on date with him but he rejects her. Shuichi asks Kumiko but instead she goes with Reina, and the two become close friends. Hazuki talks to Kumiko about her feelings for Shuichi and denial over them. Reina is chosen for the solo which causes drama and the second audition, where Reina keeps the solo. The drama regarding the solo gives Kumiko more insight into Reina's character and she finds out about her love for Taki-Sensei. Kumiko talks to Taki-Sensei and thinks about Reina's determination and it makes her realize she loves playing the euphonium.<br><br>All the major stuff stayed completely the same. The stuff that was changed was just fluff. Kumiko's feelings for Shuichi are not as obvious. Reina has more presence before the mountain date to build up for it. That sort of stuff. But absolutely nothing major and nothing game changing. Important changes would be stuff like Reina not getting the solo, Shuichi not passing the audition, Haruka not quitting the band, etc.<br><br>There is nothing about this adaptation that implies Kyoani is going for an anime original ending, so there is no reason to disregard source material when discussing the adaptation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hibikes will end next Tuesday   So is it ok for girls to like girls now?  <br> touhoushit <br> yurishit <br>why do you post this in /a/?</br></br></br>  No  <br>that's just the closest thing I have to yuri on this computer</br>  If it's a normal romance that happens to be between girls, then sure.  <br> America <br>You don't realize just how behind you really are.

At least HxH manages to bring out enough chapter in a decade to keep it's story in mind.<br><br><br>It's a pity they didn't animate it like this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish Togashi would just draw like this all the time so we could have more frequent updates. No one reads HxH for the art.</br>  <br>You need help if you reed Hiatus X Hiatus.</br>  <br> I feel for the people who've been following it for a long period of time, hiatuses are really painful <br>Well you kind of get used to it, to be honest at this point I've completely forgot about HxH because I'm not expecting it to come back, it's too bad since they manga got really interesting but what can you do.</br></br>  <br>I do the same thing anon.

I imagine some of us read your mentioned manga.</br></br></br>  <br> did Jump ever had a manga similar to HxH? <br>The original HiatusxHiatus is on permanent hiatus since 2006.</br></br>  /a/, what did Chrollo say to Neon?  <br>I still don't get why he was wearing that bandage.</br>  <br>You know, I finally understood why Kurapika wanted to be an Enhancer. I think that Enhancement and Trasmutation are the best categories if what you'll do the most is fight. <br><br>I thought Conjurers would function like mages or something like that, where they could use really powerful hatsus but they would run out of aura really fast. <br><br><br>I can only imagine. I'm going on a year now.<br><br><br>Wasn't he easily recognizable because of his Peter's Cross? I imagine that's why wore it. Goddamn, his design for this part was amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurapika wanted to be an enhancer because it's the most balanced category for combat. If he didn't have emperor's time, Uvo's punches would have broken his spine.<br>I thought his hatsu was pretty funny, because it's pretty special snowflakeish but all it does is make him better at the most basic things like defense.</br></br>  <br> chicken <br>That's clearly a turkey.</br></br>  <br>stop reading shounen garbage</br>  <br>we facebook now <br> <br><br>as expected from this cancerous thread</br></br></br></br>  Do you think Togashi plans out the series plot during hiatus or after he's told he has a week to release a chapter or you'll get fired you useless piece of shit cunt?  <br>Yeah, I know why he wanted to be one. And yes, it is pretty funny. But I'll be sad if that's the only thing he uses ET for. I'm hoping he'll develop a hatsu for each category. Kurapika's smart, he can do it.<br><br><br>You really needed some quotation marks, dude. <br>And I honestly don't know. I imagine he has a rough draft in his head of where he wants to take things to, but will deviate if necessary. Something like "let the story write itself.'</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What else did you expect from a shitty shounen thread? It caters to the lowest of the low.</br>  I can't understand why HxH is considered good tier when its creator keeps fucking everyone over.<br><br>Even Japan is sick of it</br></br>  <br>When you look at what happened with YYH and the fact that he has some pretty serious health issues, you can't really blame Togashi.

It might have been a bit meandering at the start when the setting was being established, but the palace invasion onward was obviously thoroughly planned. Couldn't wrap up so many character arcs otherwise.</br>  Try being a NANA fan......sorry but I don't give a fuck about your 2 year hiatus when NANA has been on hiatus for 6.  <br>How many threads have you posted this in?</br>  <br><br>Just this one afaik, possibly 2 though that other one must've been months ago. Nana is a very popular manga and has a well known very long hiatus.<br><br>Sorry</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all hiatuses are created equal. I loved Nana but I don't feel any serious urge to see the end, there wasn't as much half resolved plot as there is in HxH.</br>  <br>I was thinking of picking it up but i don't want to follow a 4th manga that is on permanent hiatus.<br> Is it worth it? </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br>Pitou is not a girl</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br>Pitou is pure you sick fuck.</br>  <br>Please don't.</br>  <br>Pure girls don't kill.</br>  <br><br>I think so but only if you can handle an unbroken haitus.<br><br><br><br>Disagree, I cannot even remember wtf was going on in Hunter x Hunter. Nana drops off at a crucial and life shattering point of Nana's disappearance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much.<br><br>If Togashi had planned it through, it could have been a solid arc and completed in much less time. Though I appreciate its ambition. Maybe he'll get it right with DC this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Nana has one big unresolved plot point, HxH has a bunch. You not being able to remember things doesn't mean they don't exist. <br><br>Battle shounen naturally has more going on than a story based on romance and friendship alone.</br></br></br>  <br>How does killing make Pitou a slut?<br><br>Togashi obviously had planned it. Shit, some things that were in the first 15 chapters were mentionned in the last few ones, and the character development of most important characters was gradual through the arc.<br>I know people like to shit on this arc but at least try not to be wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he </br>  <br> completed in much less time. <br>Considering your complaint is about the length, you probably take issue with the most well planned aspect of the arc, which is all the different plot points. Multiple storylines happening at once drag out the pace by necessity, but it also takes a lot of planning ahead to ensure each character plays an important role and all the loose ends are resolved.</br></br>  <br> scanlation </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127218305 <br> implying <br>she's literally saint mary</br></br>  <br>in all version they use a male word , sorry</br>  <br> Maybe he'll get it right with DC this time. <br>Optimistic, aren't you?

Killua is second best boy after Gon</br>  <br>To set him apart from Gon, I guess.</br>  if the zoldyck's wanted killua to be the new heir of the household, why didn't they immediately start training him nen?  <br>so he wouldn't use it to become independent too early. they wanted to control him. it didn't matter though because Gon claimed him anyway.</br>  Hisoka is obviously best boy.<br><br><br>It would have been harder to keep him under control. Remember how batshit insane and obsessive his mom and Illumi are?</br></br></br>  <br>They never said Killua was best boy; that was me. You really shouldn't assume things, anon.

It's personally reasonable for Illumi to want to keep his little brother out of harm's way. Look at all the trouble he's gotten himself into without Illumi's guiding hand there to protect and nurture him.</br></br>  <br>Fucking love this scene. It pretty much defines what Gon goes through during the Chimera Ants arc and the rest of the series too, but to a lesser extent. There are things that he is not able to tame in this world.</br>  <br> There are things that he is not able to tame in this world. <br>Like Killua's shit personality.</br></br>  <br> kil needs an isolated child to correct his behavior and train him like a puppy </br>  <br>His personality is endearing and cute.<br>Killua is very tameable.</br></br>  <br> His personality is endearing and cute. <br>That joke isn't funny anymore.</br></br>  <br>Gon tamed Killua very well. notice how as soon as he was no longer the center of Gon's attention is when Killua went to shit. Killua's personality disorder is medicated by boy love</br>  <br>His personality went to shit when he left home.</br>  <br>Illumi pls</br>  <br>Go to bed Illumi</br>  <br>his personality was always shit<br><br>he even acknowledged it</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why but this picture gives me butterflies in my stomach each time i see it.</br>  <br>It's because it's Gon and Killua being carefree as they'll never be again</br>  <br> His personality is endearing and cute. </br>  Man why does Togashi just doesn't get someone else to do the drawing and just do the story  <br>Because without Togashi's art it wouldn't be the same.</br>  <br>It's so ugly any other artist can imitate it.</br>  <br>I vote Murata</br>  <br> Togashi's art <br> ugly <br>Other than the scribble chapters can you post one page that you would consider ugly?</br></br></br>  <br>Every single one.</br>  <br>You didn't post a page, anon.

If Togashi can hand him the storyboard then it's perfect though</br>  <br>Shit, I would just take the storyboard at this point.</br>  <br>Ho many can you name /a/?<br> Yugi <br> Yusuke <br> Ken <br> Bobobo </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you seriously not able to name all of those?</br>  <br>I haven't read much shounen.</br>  <br>You should read more. Most of it is worth reading.</br>  <br>But anon, I'm not joking. His personality cute and I love him!<br>You just have different tastes than I do, and that's okay.</br></br>  <br> because a person who emotionally abandons his supposed best friend and can't show him any affection what so ever, yet still expects it out of said best friend is cute. <br> becaues a person who isn't there for their best friend when they go through an emotional breakdown and yet still guilt trips them afterwards is cute. <br><br>anon plz.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon always had a very small build.</br>  <br> girl </br>  <br>Mistakes don't define a person.<br>But, both of the things you've said have been pointed out within the series, so since it's been brought to attention that obviously means Killua will grow past being like that, reflect, and (maybe) apologize to Gon for it.<br>However, I don't wish to get into an argument over this. If you see him as a bad person, there isn't much I can say to change your mind, and as someone who's had this same argument several times I think it'd be best if we dropped this, and maybe you accept others have different tastes than you. I'm not sure why people saying they like Killua seems to set off so many people in these threads, but again, I suppose it's all up to taste.</br></br></br>  <br> h-he's not shit, he'll grow out of it! <br>Everytime</br></br>  <br>Fuck me, meant for </br>  <br>Anon I think you've been reading too much fanfic. No one ever called out Killua for being shit to Gon during the CA arc. And no one has ever called out Killua for being unable to show Gon any affection yet expecting Gon to show him it. Killua himself hasn't realize that he was shit to Gon and that he abandoned him, when Gon needed him the most. Instead Killua expected Gon to give him an apology for crap that mostly went on in his own head.<br><br>Is Killua a bad person no, Killua does this things without realizing that he's being hurtful. Does Killua have a shit personality that is in no way shape or form cute? Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Pituo doesn't have a gender, the only ant that reproduces is the Queen which means all the other ones don't really have a gender or are male.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure Alluka chastised him for his behavior.<br>Like I said, I do not wish to go through these motions again, just look into virtually any HxH thread and you'll find these same arguments.<br>I think Killua is a good person, and I personally like his personality. <br>Again, if you don't like his personality, that's your personal taste and I won't argue about it. There are plenty of people that do like it.<br><br>That's your interpretation/opinion. I don't really care how you see him. I like him, and your opinion won't change that.<br><br>Sorry if any of this came off as rude. I don't mean to offend.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Comparing MHA to Naruto <br><br><br>They aren't even that similar I don't know why everyone is comparing them, if anything it takes more from one piece with all of the colorful and interesting characters and their interesting powers. We even know that Kohei is a OP fan as he sent in fan art when he was 15. Pic related to that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alluka only chastised him for the guilt trip, however she never chastised him for the other crap I mentioned, and no Alluka chastising him for guilt tripping Gon doesn't make the fact that Killua was guilt tripping Gon any better. It doesn't make Killua's personality any less shitty. All it means is that Alluka doesn't have a shitty personality and is able to recognize that there are somethings you just don't do.<br><br>All you can say to counter it is maybe Killua will grow out of it, but that's not changing the fact that he's shit in the present. Its not just the fact that Killua made mistakes that makes his personality shit. His personality is shit that's why he makes those mistakes.<br><br>Maybe it would be easier if you could say what about him you found cute, but its really hard to accept your opinion when the story shows that the things you find cute are in fact not cute at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm surprised /a/ likes HxH so much.<br>After watching the first few episodes I felt like it was gonna be lackluster as fuck but episode 3 or I think two turned around after seeing how based Gon was.</br>  <br>Well, I find a lot of things about him cute (outside of physical aspects). <br>He seems to dress how he wants and doesn't care about how it looks, he's mischievous, cheeky, can be a bit snarky, and confident. He has a huge sweet tooth and a horrible tendency to take poor care of money he earns. He gambles, he's messy, he gets embarrassed easily, and he's logical, loyal, and kind.<br>I think Killua's really swell.</br></br></br>  <br>I basically came to love him starting at pic related. It's cheesy that he just wants to be a normal boy and follow Gon around, and that Gon just happens to be the only person who could ever like him outside of his family, because they all, like you, think he's shit. Even Leorio never really got used to him. I find his obsession with Gon adorable even though it isn't healthy and he was a shit and went out of his way to make Gon not know he cared. I think deep down he's really a good person, he's painfully oblivious to how other people feel, and he can invent entire conflicts in his own head. I can't help but find his feeling rejected by Gon doing something that 'I had nothing to do with..' extremely cute.</br>  Why didn't he just tell Gon that Kite was fucked?  <br>he wanted to protect his smile, but he only managed to do it in the short term</br>  <br>He didn't want to rain on his parade, he was overcome by Gon's hopefulness.<br><br>That bitch with the bubble gum should have told him that Kaito probably wasn't coming back, at least as his old self.</br></br></br>  <br>I admire your will power. If I took half the posts I see here seriously I would have killed myself long ago.</br>  <br>Now I know you have been reading a lot of fanfic, or at least confuse Killua's thoughts for actual narration.<br><br>Killua has never once shown Gon that he cared, in every time that Gon has ever been affectionate with Killua, Killua has always rebuffed him, I think you're mistaking one of Killua's conversations with Palm or Ikalgo with ones that he's had with Gon. It's also a lie to say that others don't really get used to him, since its really Killua whose holding Leorio at arm's length, not the other way around. On top of that we do get to see Killua open up to others, as the CA arc shows us later on its not others that's the problem its Killua.<br><br>I don't know what's adorable about a obsession driven by selfishness, Killua notices what Gon is going through but doesn't care because he wants Gon to pay attention to him. His overreaction is what causes him to physically and emotionally abandon his friend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Selfishness.<br><br><br><br>Only Killua was there and could say that Kite was dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still not interesting in arguing, but <br> Now I know you have been reading a lot of fanfic <br>That person is not the one you've been talking/said the original fanfic line to, I am. I was <br>I don't mean to disregard your post, apologies if it comes off that way. I just thought you'd like to know who you are replying to.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I feel for you, Killuafags, I admire those of you who don't shitpost.</br></br></br>  <br> Killua holding Gon's rod </br>  <br>correction- don't shitpost too much and argue, since everybody shitposts some<br><br><br>I am still conflicted about this. Killua sees how powerful Pitou is and that Kite is screwed so he knocks Gon out and runs away with him. He didn't directly see Kite die, but he saw Pitou's power. After that they see broken Kite.<br><br>He never directly saw Kite's head chopped off, right? So maybe there was a possibility, however small, that Kite is still alive but broken. At least that's how I got it. If he told Gon that he should let go, Gon would never accept it because he saw Kite "alive".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pika Pika  Can Chrollo beat Netero?  <br>Can pigs fly?</br>  <br>In the HxH world, probably.</br>  <br>best girl</br>  <br>He says "i let Kite to die" in the page just before. Killua is much more experienced about that sort of things than Gon. He knew Kite was dead.</br>  <br> I find his obsession with Gon adorable even though it isn't healthy and he was a shit and went out of his way to make Gon not know he cared <br> I can't help but find his feeling rejected by Gon doing something that 'I had nothing to do with..' extremely cute. <br>what the fuck is wrong with killuafags</br></br></br>  <br>Deluded beings who are driven by their cock.</br>  <br>This is a reallly interesting point of view to me. I don't frequent HxH threads on here often, and I'd always read the CA arc as Gon pushing away Killua, not Killua abandoning Gon. Huh.</br>  <br> I'd always read the CA arc as Gon pushing away Killua, not Killua abandoning Gon. <br>This is what happens when you take a character's thoughts for actual narration.<br>Same thing happened at the end of the arc, with people believing Ikalgo's thoughts were the moral of the story.</br></br></br>  <br>Gon's behavior in contrast to Killua's in the Election arc gives it more context. Gon learned from his mistakes and tries to make things right with Ging, Kite, and Killua. Killua blames Gon for his mistakes and guilt trips him for them.</br>  <br>But then I suppose you could say from Killua's POV it really was Gon who was pushing him away?<br><br>I wish there'd be some arc of HxH with more of Gon's thoughts, because I'd honestly like to get inside his head.<br><br>But you know.<br><br> hiatus x hiatus </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do you apologize for fucking up THIS badly?</br>  <br>rekt</br>  <br>Of course, but when you look at it objectively, Killua fucked up more than Gon.</br>  <br>that's not ugly</br>   All this talk about kil abandoning gon in CA. <br>What the fuck was he supposed to do in that scenario? Gon was WAY beyond helping. I always saw that part as gon isolating himself and kil just accepting it while knowing that he couldn't do anything to help gon.</br>  <br>Tell Gon Kite was dead and stop letting him delude himself into believing he could save Kite. He only was beyond saving because Killua did absolutely nothing for him.</br>  <br> Gon was WAY beyond helping. <br>Because of Killua. We'll never know if Gon could have been saved because Killua deliberately lied to him.</br></br>  <br>yes he can , chrollo can fight silva and zeno in same times , and he can use some nen with his book , netero can't beat him .</br>  <br>Chrollo would probably die after a couple of hits.</br>  <br><br>You guys act like he was trying to hurt gon by telling him a man he cared about was still alive. <br>You have to remember Kil's just a kid too, in that moment he just wanted to agree with his friend and not put out gon's light which he adored so much. If that's not caring (despite the unforeseen resulting pain) then I don't know what is.</br></br></br>  <br>It did him more wrong than good.<br>You also have to take into account his behavior during the election arc.</br></br>  <br>He was so caring when he emotionally and physically abandoned Gon, shouted at his decaying body, and guilted him after he recovered from his suicide attempt!</br>  <br> It did him more wrong than good <br>Kil had no way of knowing that though, he did what he believed would be best in that situation.<br>My memory's a bit hazy so I can't really remember, what happened in the election ark?</br></br></br>  <br> Kil had no way of knowing that though <br>He did once he realized that Gon was losing it. Off the top of my head, there was the time where they found Kite's puppet corpse thing, Morel was testing Gon, the moment just before the invasion and his confrontation with Pitou where Killua noticed it. Although it probably was too late for the last 2.<br> My memory's a bit hazy so I can't really remember, what happened in the election ark? <br>Go read it again. If you look at it objectively, you'll see how wrong Killua is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He did once he realized that Gon was losing it <br>That's not really something that could be helped. Once Gon started to lose it he was out of kil's reach. That's not his fault.<br> you'll see how wrong kil is <br>I think I'm going to reread the whole thing sometime soon. I miss this series too much.</br></br></br></br>  <br> killua's a major reason why gon got to that point <br> it's not his fault </br></br>  <br> Once Gon started to lose it he was out of kil's reach. <br>He managed to calm him down when he was with Morel, and somewhat let him regain his composure when he was facing Pitou. Gon would have been horribly traumatized either way, but if Killua was the one who told him that Kite was dead instead of Pitou, things wouldn't have gotten out of hand as much as they did.</br></br>  <br>That's fair enough, I just think your trying too hard to blame kil when his intentions where clearly good.</br>  <br>Of course, no one is saying that Killua did it to harm Gon. But the thing is that he never realized he was at fault and instead blamed Gon.</br>  <br> show has 4 fags as the main characters <br> asks why threads are gay <br><br>Do you even smile again?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Leorio is straight.</br>  <br> leorio <br> kurapika <br> killua <br> gay </br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Killua is gay.</br>  <br>Yeah maybe, but I think Gon still would have wanted revenge for Kite's death. And I don't think Kil (or a lot of people) could have told their best friend that the person they admire is most likely dead when you can't say you know for sure and they're trying their best to be positive about an obviously grim scenario.<br><br>I think that failing to prevent something you could have doesn't mean you're at fault. And Gon did go completely insane there at the end (to the point where he regretted his actions) I think Kil is right to scold Gon for that(not blame, scold)<br>There was a lot of wrong doing and a lot that could have been done differently but to blame a child for not doing something that seemed hard and wrong at the time and hate him for it is taking it a bit overboard don't you think?</br></br></br></br>  <br>At this point you're only speculating.<br>The facts are here, Killua fucked up because he was upset he wasn't Gon's center of attention and blamed his own mistakes on him. <br>Gon was experiencing severe trauma and didn't have anyone to help him though it, so he can hardly be blamed either.</br></br></br>  <br>was*</br>  <br>I think I'm speculating about as much as you are. We're both just trying to get inside the characters heads to understand their actions.<br>Gon did have someone to help him through it, he just wouldn't listen because he was so lost.<br>He knew what he wanted and didn't let anything get in the way of that.</br></br></br>  <br> Gon did have someone to help him through it, he just wouldn't listen because he was so lost. <br>Why was he lost? Because it was too late at that point. Killua reacted when it was much too late and got pushed away as a result, and still cried about it.</br></br>  <br>reminder that killua knew gon was losing himself and chose not to do anything about it</br>  <br> Why was he lost <br>Again you just putting blame on kil unfairly<br>These are the facts as you put it so well in your earlier post. Kil tried to keep gon cheerful after they escaped pitou. Gon found out about kite's death in a worse way as a result. Kil let his friend have some space. Gon went on a rampage and blocked everyone out.<br>Stop trying to point the finger at kil for something he didn't do when he thought it was right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't seem to recall the events of the arc properly. When Gon got reunited with Kite's corpse puppet thing, he deluded himself into believing he was still alive and possible to save. However, Killua knew that Kite was dead since they left him behind. Then comes the scene where he has to stop Gon because he's starting to lose it in front of Morel.<br>So at this point, Killua is LETTING Gon delude himself, even knowing it's harmful for him and that it will only make things worse once Gon accepts the fact that Kite is dead.<br>You're not looking at things objectively anon. Killua did abandon Gon emotionally, and still blamed all of it on him.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't see that at all. When Gon saw Kite's corpse puppet thing I took it as Gon realizing that Kite had died back then and him just not wanting to accept it (something common in grieving) This also explains why he actually did lose it in front of Morel, because he knew that Kite was dead and Kil knew that he knew and accepted his grieving by stopping him when he started to lose it and just being by his side as they went on. <br>I guess it's all just speculation though.</br></br>  And Gonfags ruin yet another thread with their ridiculous hyperbole and melodrama.  <br>I don't think Killua knew for sure that Kite was dead either, bro. Both Killua and Palm were shocked when Pitou didn't heal Kite and instead turned on Gon. They weren't expecting it.</br>  <br>Killua didn't expect Pitou to turn on Gon because they had Komugi hostage.</br>  <br> I took it as Gon realizing that Kite had died back then and him just not wanting to accept it <br>Doubtful, see pic related. He only lost it against Morel because he told him "attack me as if i were the one responsible for Kite".<br><br>Killua was only surprised because he didn't know Pouf tricked Pitou.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wah wah why do people realize Killua is shit <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Do you think Gon "always look at the bright side of things" would be that mad at what happened to kite if he didn't know there was no bringing him back?<br>Come on, be real here.</br></br>  <br><br>He also told Gon to calm down and not kill Pitou because they couldn't get Kite back that way. There was no reason to negotiate with Pitou and let Gon go alone with it if it couldn't give them what they wanted, so his actions make no sense if he didn't think there was any chance of Kite being revived.</br></br>  <br>Gon was mad because he felt responsible for what happened to Kite.<br><br>At that point, Gon was about to kill both Pitou and Komugi. Killua realized Komugi was an important person and that Gon would regret killing an innocent.</br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't self anger, that was grief.</br>  <br>That still doesn't explain why the hell he would let Gon go off with Pitou to get Kite healed when that's just putting him in unnecessary danger.</br>  <br>You have to put things into context here. Gon was too weak to help Kite after indirectly causing him to lose his arm (and possibly his fight against Pitou) and too weak to beat Knuckle to be able to go to NGL and "save" Kite. Gon was extremely angry at himself, which is the reason why he let Kite's corpse beat the shit out of him.<br><br> unnecessary danger <br>Killua knew Pitou wouldn't try anything as long as they had Komugi hostage. He didn't even care about Gon being in danger that much, he even wanted to die with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He didn't even care about Gon being in danger that much, he even wanted to die with him. <br>You're interpreting things in an absolutely retarded way. Of course Killua wanted Gon to live, but the situation was dangerous enough that he assumed they were going to get killed by Pitou, in which case he wanted to go out together with Gon. He was not actually wishing death on him.</br></br>  <br>I never said Killua wished death on Gon, what are you talking about? I'm only saying he wasn't set on avoiding "unnecessary danger".</br>  <br>Well again this is all speculation, but the fact that we'd seen gon be mad at himself for being weak can give us an idea that something this extreme is more than that. If you just read into it a little more, the vibe is putting off grief more than anything. But I'm done arguing with you.<br>In the end, this is all speculation.</br></br>  <br>My bad, I assumed that's what you were trying to say since I've seen that same argument thrown around in these threads. <br><br>But even if Pitou wouldn't do anything, there was no point of having Gon go with it if they couldn't get Kite back. They might as well have used Komugi as a bargaining chip for Pitou's own life instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Well when you think about it, it was the ideal situation for Killua. Pitou would have to tell Gon Kite was dead, and if Gon wanted to take his anger out on her then she could do nothing against him because of their hostage.</br>  <br>I love her deep-olution</br>  <br>Can pigs learn nen?</br>  <br> her </br>  <br>I really, highly doubt Killua would've taken all the steps he did and reacted the way he did if he didn't think Kite could come back. Even if Pitou hadn't turned on him, Gon still would have flipped out when Pitou revealed Kite was dead. I doubt Killua thought things through that little.</br>  <br>Pig arc when?</br>  <br>Buhara is a hunter so yes.</br>  <br>Come on anon, Killua explicitely says he let Kite to die and that Gon's optimism was only light hiding the truth. Killua probably only didn't want to be the one to deal with telling Gon Kite was dead, like he didn't want to deal with Nanika.</br>  <br>I understand all of that perfectly well. Didn't I explain that I found him cute despite him not expressing any affection towards Gon? Why are you telling me a bunch of stuff I already know</br>  <br>He said Gon's optimism was light and that it was hard for him to look at directly, meaning he considered himself, the "darkness," unworthy of Gon. I think you're referring to a mistranslation in the scanlations.<br><br>If Killua really was that reluctant to tell Gon that Kite was dead, he wouldn't want it coming from Pitou of all people. It would be much more Killua-like to arrange things so Gon never finds out the truth at all.</br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't give a damn about him if his looks matched his hideous personality.</br>  <br>Different Killuanon here, and jokes on you, anon, it's his personality that I find cute.</br>  <br>I explained that I think his personality is cute though</br>  <br>What's cute about an unhealthy mindset?</br>  <br>It's executed well, makes sense that he ended up that way given his upbringing, and flawed characters are more interesting to watch. Gon isn't exactly flawless either, you know. Most of the cast isn't, and that's why it's so good.</br>  <br>nothing, they just pretend to like his personality 'cause they want to rape him<br><br>same as pitoufags</br></br></br>  <br>So Buhara is a cannibal</br>  <br> tfw no new pika chapters <br>Why live?</br></br>  <br>Killua was clearly trying to delay it as much as he could, but there was a point where Gon had to learn it.<br>You didn't really adress any of my points either. Again, it was the perfect situation for Killua.</br></br>  <br>Nice try. There's only one HxH character I want to fuck, and that's  Palm. </br>  <br>The difference is that Gon realizes his flaws while Killua doesn't, and instead blames him for his own mistakes.<br>Killua's personality is objectively shit.</br></br>  <br> makes sense that he ended up that way given his upbringing <br>Killua can easily reach out to other people, as shown with Palm and Ikalgo. His upbringing is no excuse for what he did to Gon. Shit personality.<br> Gon isn't exactly flawless either, you know. <br>Except Gon acknowledged his flaws and Killua blamed Gon for his. And Gon doesn't have an awful personality paired with his flaws like Killua does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you not find Gon's hopeless, childish optimism cute, even though it ends up causing him horrible grief in the end? Even Killua loved it knowing it was bad</br>  <br>But I did address your point. If the idea is that Killua doesn't want Gon hurt, why would he let their worst enemy be the one to crush his spirit? It doesn't make sense. At least have Morel or whoever the fuck break the news.</br>  <br> the only ant that reproduces is the Queen <br><br>Every ant that isn't the Royal Guard can reproduce. Soldiers are supposed to go off and breed with other species while kings are supposed to produce more queens.</br></br></br>  <br>Killua's thoughts do not match up to the reality, in fact had Killua not been in his head so much he could have helped Gon.<br><br>Killua's thoughts are not the narration for the events.</br></br></br>  <br> If the idea is that Killua doesn't want Gon hurt <br>That wasn't my point, i said he didn't want to be the one to deal with breaking the news to Gon, just like with Nanika. Again, if Pitou was the one breaking the news, Killua might have believed Gon could have taken revenge without any risks thanks to their hostage.</br></br>  <br>Why are you bringing Gon into this? Nobody is talking about not liking Gon, only that they like Killua.<br><br><br><br>What did he do to Gon that was so terrible? Ask for an apology? He was the one who brought Gon back in the end and thanked him for everything he did for him. While he certainly didn't deal with plenty of things well himself, I don't know how you could expect him to not be upset after what happened.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>An apology for what? Being suicidal because he was dealing with something highly traumatizing, and had no one to help him through it? I don't think you realize Killua did absolutely nothing for Gon through the CA arc.</br>  <br> he didn't want to be the one to deal with breaking the news to Gon, just like with Nanika. <br>Uh, what? He didn't avoid breaking any news to Nanika. He told Nanika to go away forever as a roundabout way of protecting her.<br><br>You can speculate that, but there's really no evidence that anybody involved thought it was completely impossible to bring Kite back. If not Killua, someone else would've stopped that shit at the door.</br></br></br></br>  <br>was meant for</br>  <br>Sorry, i think i fucked up my sentence.<br> he didn't want to be the one to deal with breaking the news to Gon, just like he didn't want to deal Nanika. <br>Running away was a huge theme for Killua.<br><br>There are more elements suggesting that Killua knew Kite was dead than the opposite.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, an apology for rushing ahead and doing his own thing without stopping to think of Killua as a partner.<br><br>Saying Killua did nothing for Gon is an exaggeration. He stayed with him, worked with him so they could get Kite back, cried with him, and stopped him when he was getting out of control with Morel. You don't just do things for people with words. Of course it wasn't enough, but acting like Killua willfully abandoned Gon is ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br> Running away was a huge theme for Killua. <br>Oh, yes, I agree with that completely. I just don't think that him knowing Kite was permadead makes any sense, but I suppose we've come to an impasse there.</br></br>  <br>He outright admits to it. Don't take Killua's thoughts as narration, his thoughts don't match up to reality and frequently contradict.</br>  <br> Do you not find Gon's hopeless, childish optimism cute, even though it ends up causing him horrible grief in the end? <br>No, I don't. Why would I?</br></br>  Killua keeping Gon in check was the one thing that kept the friendship equal. The moment Killua allowed Gon to believe his own “Kite is alive” bullshit, their friendship turned unequal with Killua at the bottom of it.<br><br>By letting Gon go unchecked, Killua isn’t doing either of them any favours. Gon starts to slowly but surely lose it, and Killua finds that he disappears under Gon’s shadow, and he can’t handle that emotionally. That leads to a vicious cycle of not voicing his reservations about Kite in fear that Gon would overwhelm him even further, which leads to Gon finding new and creative ways of destroying himself as thoroughly as possible.<br><br>I’ve been having a lot of trouble putting my finger on where Killua failed Gon and putting it into words. On the outside, supporting your friend seems okay. But that’s not Killua supporting Gon, that’s Killua enabling Gon instead of pulling the brakes and telling Gon that there’s no chance in hell Kite is alive.<br><br>In the end, the CA arc was just a terrible turn of events for everyone involved.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that shit wad all in Killua's head. Also Gon didn't run on ahead, Killua left him. Killua did willfully abandon Gon, don't mistake his thoughts as narration.</br>  <br>When does he admit it? I don't recall that at all.</br>  <br>It really comes down to Gon being unable to face failure and the death of a loved one, and Killua needing to be the center of Gon's attention</br>  <br>You what, mate? You're now just denying events that happened on screen.</br>  <br>I'm not it's who is mistaking events and mistaking Killua's thoughts as narration, when they don't even match the events.</br>  <br>The moment Gon wakes up.</br>  <br>Are you referring to when Gon jumped to the building where Pitou was and Killua stayed behind for a few seconds because he was too preoccupied with his thoughts?</br>  <br>You keep repeating "Killua's thoughts aren't narration" without explaining what the hell you mean. The events on screen were as I described, I barely even touched on Killua's personal interpretation of them.</br>    <br>No, I was thinking more of Gon telling Killua to fuck off when he told him not to murder Pitou, telling Killua to shut up and let him do the talking, and overall not consulting Killua in a single decision he made since they started the invasion.</br>  <br>That was right before Gon insisted Kite was alive. Killua then got caught up in Gon's optimism and desperately wanted to believe he was right.</br>  <br> wanted to believe <br>Then you're admitting he knew Kite was dead.</br></br>  <br>Does it need explanation? Killua's thoughts aren't narration, he's over thinking shit and being a drama queen. Hell Killua even knows that's it's not about him, but he wants it to be.</br>  <br>Which was the result of Killua abandoning Gon.</br>  <br>Deep down, he probably had I clue, but I think he ended up in denial just as much as Gon was.<br><br><br>It does need an explanation, because I mentioned events that really happened and all you can is "thoughts aren't narration!" What part of what I mentioned are you claiming didn't happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he didn't do that. Not giving Gon an emotional pep talk is not the same as abandoning him.</br>  I want Killuafags and anti-Killuafags to leave.  <br>In my defense, they started it.</br>  What did he mean?  <br>I think he was talking about Kite's attack pattern.</br>  <br>Except it wasn't, Killua outright admits that he doesn't give a shit about Kite and that he wanted to be Gon's center of attention. Ergo his thoughts which is really just him over thinking and being selfish aren't reliable. Hell we even have a third person narrator so that you can tell the difference.</br>  <br>They talking about how Kite's movements are mechanical like a doll's, and Gon could read the patterns of his attacks. Yet he was actively choosing not to dodge.</br>  <br>I honestly have no clue which of my points you're even referring to now.</br>  <br>It was after Killua had failed to<br> tell Gon Kite was dead <br> enabled his delusion  <br> wanted every thing to be about him <br> abandoned Gon physically </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Togashi ended YYH because of asshole editor.</br></br>  <br> Chrollo would have died very easily in the Yorkshin fight if the godfathers hadn't <br> He wouldn't even be able to react to Netero <br>Are all Ryodanfags this delusional?</br></br></br>  <br> tell Gon Kite was dead <br> enabled his delusion  <br>He fucked up in going along with Gon's delusion, but that's not abandonment. That's poor judgement.<br><br> wanted every thing to be about him <br>He hadn't even said anything to Gon about it at that point. As an anon here likes to point out so often, Killua's thoughts aren't spoken aloud.<br><br> abandoned Gon physically <br>When?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Killua outright admits that all he cares about is being the center of Gon's attention even while knowing what Gon was going through.</br>  <br>Killua ignoring Gon's emotional state to focus on his desire to be the center of Gon's world is emotional abandonment.<br><br>Doesn't change the fact that his motivation is selfish.<br><br>When he got to caught up in his thoughts and left Gon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't say it was all he cares about it. He said he was upset that Gon didn't rely on him as a friend during all of it. That's not being the center of attention, that's just wanting attention.<br><br>He also then admits that he's throwing a bit of a tantrum. But Killua is needy, so of course he feels bad when he's treated like he isn't needed.</br></br></br>  <br>Killua going along with Gon's delusion wasn't related to him wanting to be the center of Gon's world. It was related to him putting Gon on a pedestal and going along with whatever Gon says. Which is still bad, but the kid has problems.<br><br>I don't care about his motivation. It doesn't justify Gon shutting him down like you were trying to claim.<br><br>On the roof? He was one second behind him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> was <br>please, how do you think he's paying for him and Alluka's vacation? <br>he's slutting it up with older men.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes he did, read the fucking manga.<br><br>Killua never once admits that he's throwing a tantrum, you've been reading too much fanfic.</br></br></br>  So are discussions about the CA arc just a contest to see who fucked up the most?  <br>He does. "Tada no dada da." Your translations are bad, broski.</br>  <br>Yep. I think it's kind of a testament to how good Togashi's writing was, honestly.</br>  <br>Yes it was, he even fucking admits to it. He didn't care about Kite being dead, he didn't care about Gon's emotional state what he wanted was to be Gon's center of attention, and then still expects everything to be okay.<br><br>And that was enough for things to go south.<br><br>Gon shut him down because he was traumatized, and at his breaking point. Killua waited until the very last minute to say something to Gon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet you won't post the manga image of him admitting to throwing said tantrum.</br>  <br>I'm on my phone. It's the panel focused on his clenched fists during the hospital monologue.</br>  <br>This one?</br>  <br>Yeah, that one. "I was just a burden" is a mistranslation.</br>  <br>Which was really Killua talking about himself, not him admitting to his failure.<br><br>And if you want to say that that's a mistranslation do you have a better translation?</br></br></br>  <br>Uh, yes? "This is just a tantrum."</br>  So where the fuck was she?  <br><br>auditioning for sao, she got sick of beta kirito</br></br>  <br>Bell is op enough to one shot goliat. She mostlt is not needed.</br>  Out of the dungeon.  <br>oh shit, she left like 2 days before didn't she? I can't believe I forgot that</br>  <br>Freyja also not present i'm dissapointed. It's will be better with proper closure but probably the action and animation takes too much budget for proper ending party or explanation about bells skill.</br>  <br>  implying kirito is not beta </br>  So, can all we agree that vanilla is best flavor?  <br>He can one shot kill goliath level 5 florr boss he is not beta.</br>  <br>I prefer my icecream to be chocolate and mocha flavored.</br>  So it's confirmed in lastest eps that bell stronger than ryuu and mostly at average level 5 adventurer.  S2 when?  But really, is Vanilla actually the best flavor?<br>Or is chocolate objectively superior?</br>  <br>Beru-kun would still get raped by Ryuu and a lot of other adventurers, but he has a nuke for when shit hits the fan.</br>  <br>Vanilla all the way, brother.</br>  <br><br>That sag...</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Never.</br>  <br>What do you mean. Ryuu cannot even scratch goliat let alone killed it. So do 500 people there.</br>   there are people on /a/ RIGHT NOW who wouldn't fuck Hestia <br><br>Explain yourself, homosexuals.</br></br>  <br>500 is over kill. Probably 1 hundred people.</br>  <br><br>It depends whether she is going to be clingy afterwards.

Ryuu cannot even pierce that meat.</br>  <br>Ryuu is merely distractor like the rest of the people there.</br>  <br><br>I don't care about your stupid opinion. I won't even try to state the obvious anymore.</br></br>    <br>Are you stupid. Please watch carefully or try lurking before posting. It's that clear in the anime where the regen try protect the core luckyly bell agi is very high to give a final blow before covered by the regen.</br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Aiz but I feel guilty trying to fuck an autistic girl.</br></br>  <br>Your opinion is stupid and I am not even one of those guys you replied to.</br>  <br>Bell.</br>  <br><br>Bell isn't a woman.</br></br>  <br>No, he's not, your point?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, samefag.</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Is okay if you're autistic yourself?</br>  <br>  more than 1 people disagreeing with you, it's must be samefag <br>Nice logic you have there.<br>Newfag pls</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing bro.</br>  <br>fug</br>  <br>Can't argue with that.</br>  <br>Is there any info what skill bell used against goliath? He make himself pure white or emit light on his entire body.</br>  <br>Argonaut. Now fuck off.</br>  <br>nobody know waht the fuck hapening in this ep</br>  <br>Argonaut cannot make his entire body pure white. It's mostly emit light on his weapon peak if it skill attack or in one of his hand if it's charged firebolt.</br>  Where was the giant skelator?  <br>It's easy. It just mean bell is stronger than any level 4 and mostly stronger than average level 5 adventurer. Espescially in terms of power.</br>  <br>Goliath without full armored regen is in form of skull.
