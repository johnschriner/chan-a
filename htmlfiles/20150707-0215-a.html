[ Is /a/ - iddle activities ready for the comeback of Yona?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=srP<wbr>ER56IQjY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime in less than 10 hours </br></br></br></br>  no hype for shoujos  I'm hyped, m8. Red-haired Cinderella sounds interesting  isn't the manga quite good?  <br>i'm hyped, from the PV the animation looks so beautiful and Bones is doing this</br>  Okay, which one of you are responsible for this garbage?  <br>Wrong thread?</br>  <br>PV 2 looks better<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XzX<wbr>LibJm6GE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> comeback of Yona <br>Fuck off and kill yourself.<br><br>Dont compare the gem that is Akagami to shit like Yona. Its like saying Legend of Galactic Heroes is comeback of Legend of Legendary Heroes (not that the Bones will not fuck up the adaptation)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yona&gt;Akagami.<br>By a mile.</br></br>  <br>Its great. One of best political shoujo period - in line of 12 Kingdoms, Saiunkoku Monogatari, Fushigi Yuugi. But its Bones.</br>  Fuck, they should fire that seiyu, her character doesn't match the voice for the female guard.<br><br><br>And I loved the song, you know the song name anon?</br></br></br>  <br>If its on the same level as 12 kindowms then i'm reading this right the fuck now<br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br> look! i am newfag for whome yona was babies first "historical fantasy" shoujo <br>Yona is infinitely inferior subpar clone of Saiunkoku Monogatari. Not ever worth mentioning unless you are complete newfag that did not watch anything else.</br></br>  A show that actually looks kind of all around good, yeah fat chance getting anyone here to pay any attention.  <br>I would say that Akagami is bereft of the political intrigue in these manga and is hence fundamentally different. There is little lingering conflict and things are a bit more sedate. Still a fun read.</br>  <br> political <br>Dropped</br></br>  <br>It is OP theme of the anime "Yashashii Kibou" by Saori Hayami <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3so<wbr>7XzFbmD0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>There is plenty of political intrigue. Its just the MC does not suddenly become minister of state or something like that having all centuring around her. She is support for Zen, who in turn is pawn of his brother. They get involved in lots of political stuff, just not always on first roles.</br>  Aw man, I was expecting some heavy feels with this, but MC girl basically falls in love with the guy after the first chapter.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Why is that bad?</br>  <br>She is not really anon, they are just friends.</br>  <br>Well, things are clearly not as sinister, complex or heavy in Akagami. It is nevertheless a very comfy manga, but clearly departs from the themes explored by 12 Kingdoms, Saiunkoku and even Yona.</br>  <br>There is no struggle with romance - they love each other and its a fact. The problem is that she`s a simple medic and he`s a prince - there are all kind of problems approaching her to him without causing trouble.<br><br><br>i`d say its very near to Saiunkoku in premise. As far sinister goes - there are assassination plots, plague, war, pirates kidnapping, court intrigues etc. Though indeed, it did not result in anything truly tragic and drastic yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah. They become best friends before any actual romance happens. I kinda like how low-key their relationship is, they just realize they want to be together and it all happens without any misunderstandings or other typical shoujo bullshit. It's refreshing.</br>  <br>They declare their love in a forest and kiss anon. Come on, I've read this, don't pull shit out of your ass.</br>  <br>this is the best kind of romance</br>  <br>Because of Ore Monogatari.</br>  <br>WHAT the fuck does this have to do with Idle Activities?</br>  The only downside of this manga is the typical shoujo one - litterally EVERYONE falls for Shirayuki.<br><br>I get it, she`s cute, nice and has unique hair - but there are two prince ready to marry her, people easily influenced by her right after meeting her etc.<br><br>Though manga does good by showing other side too: some people clearly think little of her, some just consider concubine approached so Zen could play with her, some trow hard checks if she`s worthy and can survive the environment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously. The author even takes a situation that is usually milked for MISUNDERSTANDINGS and drama, and has the female MC just go "Oh, I thought there was probably an explanation for it."</br>  <br>Akagami thankfully does not limit itself to two lovebirds staring each others for dozen chapters. There plenty of stuff happening.<br><br>Hell, the manga even took the most risky turn for shoujo at all - separated them for years.</br></br></br>  <br> litterally EVERYONE <br>Why can't Ameriburgers figure out how to use "literally" correctly?</br></br>  I was reading the first Volume ages ago in a local bookstore, honestly it was pretty fucking neat. Looking forward to the Anime, hoping for some comfy medieval adventure time maybe like a road trip.  <br>I wouldn't say everyone falls for her. Just Zen, Raji, and Obi. And Obi wants Zen's dick, too, so whatever.</br>  Is this 12 ep long or 24?  <br>Why do i get this feeling i've seen this on sadpanda<br>God i hate when this happens</br></br>  It's one of the shoujo manga I'm reading (bc I'm very picky with shoujo and I don't read many) so I'm very hyped about this adaption even though I'm not a big fan of the character design.  <br>Nothing really happens in this version, though. She didn't jump to any conclusions and readily accepts the explanation given.</br>  <br><br> local bookstore <br>You japanese?</br></br></br>  <br> literally <br> 1. in the literal or strict sense <br> 2. in a literal manner; word for word <br> 3. actually; without exaggeration or inaccuracy <br> 4. in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually <br>http://dictionary.reference.com/bro<wbr>wse/literally</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, german. There've been Manga departments for I don't know, 10-15 years in the stores for now ? Sadly most of it is Yaoi or BL stuff since this shit sells to the female teenage crowd like crazy.</br>  <br> her character doesn't match the voice for the female guard. <br>At first I was like you but then it grew on me, now I like the VA for Kiki.</br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-06/snow-white-with-the-re<wbr>d-hair-anime-to-have-2-split-season<wbr>s/.90118</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Nice. I still dont trust Bones until i see it.</br>  <br>Exactly, you're using the word wrong. Saying literally everyone is in love with her would mean characters such as Kiki is in love with her as well, which is blatantly untrue.</br>  Why do I always turn into such a fag when I read stuff like this?  Its a manga where all characters chatter "when will they finally fuq?" behind MCs back.<br><br>In before Zen`s brother actually set`s a demand that if Zen wants to marry Shiroyuki, he needs to make an offspring.</br></br>  People will pick it up for Shiroyuki and stay for Kiki.  Obi reminds me of Hak, forever a cuck.  I can't believe a Shirayuki-hime thread actually took off for once.<br><br> in b4 only 18 posters <br>Still better than usual.</br></br></br>  <br>is shirayuki hime the new argevollen</br>  <br> 4. in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually </br>  <br>I don't know what that is, so probably.</br>  <br>Because you are a fag</br>  <br> idle activties </br>  <br><br><br>Akagami has been translated up to the latest volume in chink. Pity my local Kinokuniya wraps them in plastic. At least each volume costs about 5 bucks. Might buy once completed.</br></br></br>  <br>They did great with Ouran</br>  <br> If its on the same level as 12 kindowms <br><br>it's not, it's boring. 12 kingdoms &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this shit and yona</br></br></br>  <br>Nah that is because she is close with Zen, people wants to know what kind of person she is. And Raji already falls for her since the beginning</br>  <br>Still untrue in context with the story. It was a big exaggaration, no matter how you try to defend it.</br>  <br>I just realize that Zen's brother is voiced by Akira Ishida</br>  <br>No, because argevollen was genuine boring trash.</br>  <br>You are the one who pull shit out of your ass. There is no declaration of love or kiss in first chapter.</br>  <br>I was not talking about the first chapter, but the ones that follow.</br>  <br><br>What is it with red haired heroines that tugs at the sense of fantasy, romance, and adventure?</br></br>  <br> The only downside of this manga is the typical shoujo one - litterally EVERYONE falls for Shirayuki. <br><br>If she's going to be a character like Snow White, a Disney-tier "princess", it hedges closer to the material that everyone falls for her.</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami <br> political </br></br>  <br>Snow White/Cinderella are shit character types. Those are plain and dumb persons that through miracle gets everyoen loving them and attention.<br><br>Shiroyuki is the opposite type - the hard working one, the capable: the one that has to prove all the time she deserves the place she is at.</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami <br> not political </br></br>  Please cover the entire manga, please cover the entire manga. I'm resisting the urge to read this so I can get the best possible experience.  <br>Its two cour, but i doubt it`ll cover entire manga (its still ongoing).<br><br>Saiunkoku Monogatari was 75 episodes long, and it still did not cover the whole novels, stopping at most interesting stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Manga will be inevitably better than anime. So it is worth reading before/during/or after anime regardless.</br>  <br> Its two cour <br>Thank you based BONES</br></br>  <br>That makes me really excited for the show, please let it be a good adaption.<br><br><br>Although I really liked the drawing style of the few pages I've seen so I might read the manga anyway.</br></br></br></br>  Hopefully they'll get to adapt the kidnapping arc. Threads about it gonna be hype.  Sexual intercourse confirmed.  Delayed with days thanks to Funi.  <br>You're kidding me, it says 4h 53m in anichart.</br>  <br>I see, you are new as shit.</br>  <br>Sasuga Funi. Raws it is.</br>  <br>Mondays will never have good anime.</br>  <br> nnb <br> not good </br></br>  <br>It is really not.</br>  <br>anichart is the time it airs in Japan, the subs are delayed by Funi</br>  Maybe someone will sub it instead of waiting for Funi. Maybe.  <br> looks so beautiful  <br> and Bones is doing this </br></br>  <br>They just kiss anon, you never kiss like that, didn't you?</br>  <br>Yes. Get hype.</br>  <br>Have faith in Ando</br>  <br>How delayed? If it's just a two or three days I guess waiting is fine.</br>  <br>Let's hope for the best, anon.</br>  <br>Fuck you Funi</br>  <br>Good</br>  <br>Fine. It's political but without actual politics.</br>  <br>But it's not. It's generic sure as far its premise goes, but its execution is overall decent. One of the better mecha series last year and I liked it far more than the rest.</br>  <br>I'm okay with raw, since we have the translated manga so can at least understand the scenes.</br>  <br>How many days? Where are you seeing this</br>  <br> summer is only a meme </br>  <br>Funi has barely subbed new shows so far, Chaos Dragon, Dandellion and Logos's subs still aren't out yet.<br><br>Anyone who wants to catch the live streaming of episode 1<br>It is in 3 hours 22 minutes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinda wish I'd understand Moon now.</br>  <br> not being able to watch stuff just fine <br>Having seen almost no anime must feel bad.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you Funi. They always do this every season.<br><br><br>I will try and watch it, unless I have stuff to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet they released Game of Laplace on time and they did it by announcing it the very day it aired. In fact, every time they announced a simulcast release they did it on the same they it was released. So I wouldn't count out Akagami from being released today just yet.</br>  <br>I try to avoid stuff that only consists of the usual boring phrases that are repeated endlessly in 90% of the shows. I usually don't even watch stuff that's still airing but this show has picked my interest.</br>  <br>Thanks for your normalfag anime blog. Where do I subscribe?</br>  <br>Do you do anything besides shitposting ?</br>  <br> s-shitposting <br>  ? <br>You should go back to reddit, friend.</br></br></br>  <br>So you don't.</br>  <br>Maybe it depends on distributor, i hope we gets Shirayuki-hime fast too because it is Warner Bro.</br>  <br>huh. since when was shirayukihime any good? i only read it when it first came out. it didn't make that much of an impression.</br>  This is nothing like Yona; this is laidback, slice-of-life-ish and mostly boring and there is no sense of urgency or progression.  What's the point comparing Yona and Akagami?<br>Both of those are  fun   in a different way.  At the very least it's not the usual shoujoshit. Still a snore-fest sometimes though. </br>  <br> slice-of-life-ish and mostly boring and there is no sense of urgency or progression. <br>I have to disagree with you, they just don't make drama out of that and the manga is actually pretty funny too</br></br>  Which is better, this or Yona?  <br>I like this better</br>  While I get why people are comparing this to Yona, it's more like Horimiya romance and pace-wise than Yona, in my opinion. <br><br>The fantasy and political background is of the same vein as Yona but the way the story is told is more slice-of-lifey, non-dramatic like Horimiya. <br><br>Yona's a tad more dramatic than Akagami. It's both good and bad. People might say it's boring because there's really no drama when it comes to Shirayuki and Zen's relationship. There's no third party trying to interfere (Obi's in love with both Shirayuki and Zen and has no intentions of ever breaking them up), Izana's on the Zen x Shirayuki wagon after quibbling a bit and that's only because he wanted Zen to be absolutely sure Shirayuki's who he wanted, Kiki and Mitsuhide have a lovely side romance going on.<br><br>Honestly, it's just a really comfy slice-of-life of royalty with a splash of political and medical/pharmaceutical issues. <br><br>Plus, I'm a sucker for big brothers who dote on their little brothers. Izana and Zen are good siblings to each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the low-key drama makes dramatic moments stand out that much more - the MC isn't constantly having to deal with attacks on her life, so the one time she gets a warning crossbow shot (with helpful description attached), it's more of a big deal.</br>  <br>Got any proof?</br>  First episode in 1 hour<br><br>neetball will stream it</br></br>  <br>What about Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii, could it be compared to that?</br>    <br>I guess it's just an assumption that Funi simulcast will be delayed like some of their series and Funi still hasn't announced the schedule for this.</br>  <br> Mentioning Fushigi Yuugi at all </br>  <br><br>Fuck is the main guy the "I always fight with my sword's scabbard on cuz I'm that good hurr" guy?</br></br>  <br>Definitely. Probably even more than Horimiya, considering the setting. The MCs in Akagami are probably just a little less dramatic than Soredemo. Really, Zen and Shirayuki are probably one of the most drama-free couples I've come across. I don't know about the future but up to the most current chapter, they've never even had a disagreement that's threatened to break them up. I tend to like my romance drama free so it's probably why I rate them high (along with Horimiya's MCs).<br><br>Story-wise, both Soredemo and Akagami deal with royalty. Soredemo's probably more political, what with the main lead the actual king of a country while Zen's just the king's younger brother.<br><br><br>Shirayuki deals with the attempts on her life nmuch better than I would. But then, she's a lot calmer than me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like  that midget. </br>  <br>When Zen fights for real, there's no scabbard. It's not that kind of series where he shows off his sword skills. He's a prince. Everyone expects him to be that good. He HAS to be that good or his brother would confine him to the castle at all costs.</br>  <br>I think it's more "I only draw my sword against equals, not commoners like you". Snobbery based on status, not skills.</br>  So there's the mouth, the vagina, and the ass. What's the fourth hole?  armpit  cleavage  PM won't allow me to disclose it OP.  <br> being this much of a virgin </br>  You can use the nostrils, but that's more of a nigger thing.

Pay attention.</br></br>  <br>So is P.A. Works gonna deliver again? People were shitting on them for taking some manga adaptation after Shirobako.</br>  <br>No she won't.<br>A secondary character and a little sister who has at most 2 possible uses:<br>Plot device and cheap drama.</br></br></br>  <br><br>wasn't this meant to be an original series?</br></br>  <br> P.A. Works gonna deliver again <br><br>They always do. Even if Glasslip just delivered fluffy and a god-tier OST.</br></br></br>  <br>It is. Don't believe those blatant lies.</br>  <br>No wrinkles here.</br>  Characters that deserve death:<br>Charlotte<br>Imouto<br><br>Characters that will probably live:<br>Charlotte</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this speculation. It's an anime-original work, after all. I'll take a crack at it.<br><br> The student council is actually a group of students that the government is trying to weaponize.  <br> They are placed on the student council to separate them from the rest of the student body so that they can leave class at convenient times to do missions and shit for the government  <br> The brother imouto and MC think they hazily remember isn't actually a brother, it's their sister, charlotte (who is currently disguised as Yumi).  <br> Charlotte has the ability to alter people's memories and outright erase them if she chooses to do so. <br> Alters MC and imouto's memories to forget her when she runs away from the school for super powered people (she was placed on the "student council" too) <br> Charlotte's power is flawed in that she ages backwards for every minute of memories that she alters <br> As such, she never graduates and loses the power because she always has to use it for government jobs which means she is never actually aging. <br> Can't take it anymore and runs away <br><br>and now depressing backstory because muh feels<br> Their parents died when they were little <br> MC always wished he was someone else (because then he'd have parents) <br> Charlotte alters their memories to become their single mother to get them out of their depression. Takes care of them <br> MC still longs to be someone else but doesn't know why, hence that opening scene  <br> Ends up having to leave them and make them harbor animosity towards her as the mother that foisted child custody on their uncle because she could never graduate super power school <br><br> Why is it even semi-plausible that Yumi/Charlotte is actually their sister? <br><br>Imouto and yumi have same ridiculous purple eyes. Their hair is similar (imouto always took after nee-chan, after all) in style/color. Yumi had to do bangs instead of parting it down the middle to hide her identity better. she also dyed it darker to hide her identity better. <br><br>Your turn, /a/nons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just realized charlotte is already some blonde chick. disregard that part about yumi being charlotte. yumi is still their sister for the purposes of my speculation though.</br>  <br>fuck off faggot</br>  <br>Elaborate.</br>  <br> best imouto <br><br>What</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this semen vacuum?</br>  <br> semen vacuum <br>I'd play video games (Halo ODST) with, eat ice cream with, play Monopoly with, and maybe cuddle with, but never would I do something so lewd. Maybe even  hold hands with  while we talk about the secrets of the universe.</br></br>  <br>I once saw a screenshot with this green hair making a similar pose like this one; can someone post it?</br>  <br>please respond.</br>  <br>Komachi has a name you fucking pleb.<br><br><br>Nah, i was about to post it but nah. Impatient fuckwit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry</br>  <br>Patience is a virtue. One a lot of people around here should utilize every now and then.</br>  So how many Key anime VA cameos will we get?<br><br>So far we've had Mai Nakahara and Tomoe Tamiyasu.</br></br>  What if something bad happens to imouto?  <br>I think you mean game. Also, it still baffles me how Tomoe voiced Riki, Rin, and Sasasegawa Sasami all at the same time.</br>  <br><br>Here's a bonus since I'm such a nice guy</br></br>  <br>Almost positive something bad will happen to imouto since she is the only decent character in the show.<br>When she dies, the anime will truly become worthless.</br></br>  <br>Was Clannad voiced in the original release?</br>  <br><br>If imouto get hurt, we riot</br></br>  <br> .gif <br>I'll probably end up watching the show and make some proper .webm out of it. How shit is it anyway?</br></br>  <br>It came out in 04, there was a rerelease in 06, and the anime was in 07, so I assume one of the games had voices before the anime.</br>  <br>First season was actually pretty good.</br>  <br>Maeda has not killed major characters in his stories since Little Busters, no idea why faggots still pretend he is some sort of edgemaster like le butcher</br>  <br>Can we please not turn this into another brand of generals? Like what happened to shitters such as <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127656472 </br>  Kinda on the fence with this one. The characters haven't interested me at all. MC is just a faggot with insecurity issues that likes to talk big. Imouto is cute though.  <br> Imouto is cute <br>This is reason enough</br></br>  <br>The MC is basically Kanye, with the same voice actor to boot.</br>  <br>Stop trying to police shit. Let the faggot talk about what he wants.</br>  <br>Look, I'm sorry. I just saw the "New thread" and "edition" in the OP and feared we were already devolving into generals.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127656472 <br> This is now an Oregairu thread. <br>No. My thread, you slut. I created this for the discussion of Charlotte &amp; the ever-cheerful &amp; chipper Ayu!</br></br>  <br><br>Don't worry anon, these threads have been pretty descent and anons are polite enough to let the thread reach page 10 before making another unlike yahari threads last season.</br></br>  MC is funny as fuck, I don't get why some of you guys have an issue with him. It's pretty obvious he's going to get a lot of character development.  <br>The imouto is too young to have any powers.<br> a small percent of children manifest super powers upon reaching puberty </br></br>  <br>Of course, Im glad Nao stopped him on his tracks right away. She just saved us from the generic antics of another light/lelouche gary stu.</br>  <br>Funny? In what way, anon?<br><br>People in the last thread were bitching about the MC being "edgy" for cheating in school and manipulating people. Peep the archive if you want a better idea but that's the gist of it. <br><br><br> gary stu  <br>How am I supposed to self insert as a good looking, semi-insane MC with subpar superpowers?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Fuck that bitch and fuck her derailing my fun plot for some generic magical school bullshit.<br>I would have been fine if it was just him manipulating people with super powers and regular folks trying to catch him in the act, or how he would adjust his powers.<br>But then this bitch comes in and was like "nope, I'm the boss of you and you go to join the xmen"<br>Fuck this show, fuck her, and fuck you.<br>Yes, I'm mad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me what you expect from the next episode then, because you likely have the wrong impression.</br>  <br>I liked him too, and I hate Gary Stu characters. Gary Stu and Mary Sue were used to describe super idealized characters without flaws. But it was obvious from the beginning that the anime was painting him as a douchebag, that his hubris is, and evidently was, his downfall.</br>  <br>And it's also called a Tehepero you fucking fag.</br>  <br> not submitting to Nao-sama's will <br>Anon pls. Yu clearly lacks focus and insight, thats why he got caught. Inside the group he will develop and even learn how to use his power more effectively.</br></br>  <br>Go back to watching Death Note edgemaster.</br>  <br>But if she didn't stop him, he would have died of ClannAIDS or something. Now he gets to make lots of friends and watch one or two of them die of ClannAIDS instead.</br>  We're going to see her again, right? They didn't waste time designing her just to give her a minute's worth of screentime, right?  <br>Shut the fuck up already about that fucking bitch you fucking cunt.</br>  <br>Sure thing. This girl will be back too.</br>  This is obviously going to get dark and edgy, could be interesting.<br><br>From the looks of this, this appears to be the consequence of misusing your powers. Seems kind of extreme considering the powers we've seen so far are far too impractical to be used for anything big.</br></br>  <br>When I was in Akihabara and looking at all the advertisements for it, I thought it was a horror anime.</br>  <br>Why, don't you like pathetic main characters?</br>  <br>Looks more to me like the ones with proper and useful powers are taken away to experimentation, or otherwise are experimented on to make the powers stick or be more powerful, kind of like the level 6 program. I think they get anyone who abuses their powers pretty quick.</br>  <br>They shouldn't spoil, in my opinion. Just watching the first episode without looking into it (well I did know the studios involved in it so they are sort of a big hint but that aside) it looks like just looks like comedy chuuni stuff. Would have made a decent "surprise" I guess.<br><br>I really don't want imouto to get hurt. I know she will, though.<br><br><br>That's also certainly a possibility. Otherwise chances are Kanye might have already been hauled off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>delusions<br>Its the same everywhere, you get those who binge on all the material possessions and then you have the few who prepare for the future they want.</br></br>  <br> being this retarded <br>I honestly don't understand why everyone hates the MC. Aside from that stupid maniacal laugh and fake disguise, everything he's done has been pretty understandable. So the guy thinks he's the only one with powers. He is able to cheat his way through school and life in general, and he is physically attractive to boot. Would this not go to your head, anon? Would highschool you not think you were the shit? Then all of the sudden his world gets turned upside down when he gets busted (he loses his confidence in front of Yumi). And to top it all off he's forced to move. That's why he seems like a meek shithead now. Why is that pathetic?</br></br>  <br>People either like absolute betas that they can feel superior to, or powerful self-inserts that get everything they want while being a paragon of virtue.</br>  <br><br><br>God damn these qts.</br></br></br>  Good subs fucking when?  <br><br>Nigga, the protagonists of great fiction aren't great because of how they measure up to the viewer. Great protagonists are great because they are sympathetic characters. Because the audience can identify with them and understand their struggles. That's all that needs to happen. So far I've seen a protaginast who had a nasty reality check (who didn't think, at some point in highschool, that they weren't the shit?) and is struggling to control his surroundings. How the fuck can you not relate to that?</br></br>  <br><br>He's a pittiable douche in many ways, but the part where he stages the accident so he can save the girl was outright selfish and ridiculous. People keep overlooking this when they try an defend him. <br> b-but you would do the same thing too <br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Way to take what I said out of context, friend. I'm talking about him being pathetic. Not about him being a douche. I never said he's a great guy.<br><br>He thinks he's the shit and he wants other people to feel the same way. So he rescues a girl from a speeding truck. Anybody with half a brain wouldn't do something that risky but its a testament to how full of himself he is.</br></br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. What you described is what makes a good protagonist. I'm talking about the sort of people who hate the MC.</br>  <br>And since this is a Key anime, the truck driver probably killed a father of four beautiful children, who are now orphans, and will have to be sold into sex slavery to avoid starving.<br><br>That's right, folks. Kanye is behind all the Japanese Truck killings you've ever seen. He deserves none of your sympathy.</br></br></br>  <br>... so the sort of people who hate the MC don't know what a good protagonist is. That's my point.</br>  <br> QC finishing now. </br>  <br>Mazui?</br>  <br>Fyurie pls go.</br>  <br>This is at least the third time I see someone mentioning Mazui in these threads, what gives?</br>  <br>Right, but you replied and addressed me as though those were my views.<br><br> ... <br>Don't do that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have to post this on every single Charlotte thread?</br>  <br>That happened,he was busted, and he acted pathetic because of that, he wouldn't be pathetic if there was no reason.Was it bad? No, and I will keep watching.</br>  <br>My bad, m8. When you said "people" I thought you were trying to speak for everyone (including yourself, of course). That didn't read like you were only trying to speak for the people that did not like him. <br><br>I did that so that I wouldn't have to start the sentence with "So." It suited my autism at the time. I'll see what I can do.</br></br></br>  I like the MC, at least he isn't a disgusting beta like bell from danmachi  The MC treats women like shit and he's a manipulative arsehole.<br><br>Don't really think I can enjoy this anime.</br></br>  The MC treats women like shit and he's a manipulative arsehole.<br><br>I really think I'm going to enjoy this anime.</br></br>  <br>Do you really think he'll stay that way, anon? After having such a rude awakening from Yumi snd learning that he isn't the only special snowflake with powers?</br>  <br>I can see why you'd think that. No worries, it just keeps popping up a lot the past week.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, it's just me. <br><br> [GJM-Mezashite] Charlotte - 01 [40A3E193].mkv </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks baby.</br>  <br>Well considering all the edgelords here would be disappointed if he started acting normal I really don't expect him to change.</br>  <br> not expecting character development <br>why am I taking this bait</br></br>  <br><br>I just want my smug MC, my smug FeMC and that qt redhead.</br></br>  I like this asshole mc.

Look at this face. Is this the face of evil?  Is this going to be another anime where nobody in the threads refer to the characters by their real names?

Cocky MC gets a reality check and is uprooted from everything that's familiar to him.

Basically, only within quotation marks. In addition, they should be used sparingly. The use of ellipses as a sort of pause, as a replacement for another punctuation mark, or within the narration (i.e. out of quotes) is almost always wrong, unless used in a poetic sense. Furthermore, ellipses should never begin a sentence. The valid situations I listed above occur after a word.<br><br>Most importantly, using ellipses incorrectly makes you look like you're 12.</br></br></br>  <br> high and mighty <br>She was extremely nonchalant when she busted the MC for cheating and shit aside from the part about his medical exams where she said that he was lying about being narcoleptic. She could have way more in his face though. If anything, she seems very goal oriented. She did what her school (probably) told her to do. Investigate MC and relocate him if needed. She never said or implied that what he was doing is wrong.</br></br>  Nice.  Wait, KEY is involved? Dropped. It could have been interesting but I now know that it will be garbage no matter how good it will be perceived as being.  <br>NOTHING is wrong WITH ellipses. There IS also nothing WRONG with random CAPITALIZATION to act as IF you're yelling WHEN this is just TEXT.

In this context, anons are just calling him alpha because he has self-confidence.<br><br>Tired of MC's who call themselves losers or weak all the time.

It's interesting when someone subverts that by turning their selflessness into a selfish desire like in Kokoro Connect though.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, the dream he had about the missing sibling can't be false because according to Descartes "You cannot have a self-contradictory image in your dreams"</br>  <br> this is what reddit cancer actually believe </br>  <br>It was the MC's monologue in the beginning, he started with Descartes, then ventured off into Kantian phenomenon, and wrapped it up with some Hume-style naturalism and free will.<br><br>As for the ellipses thing... who the fuck cares. It's an indicator of a pause or a tonality or a combination of both, and it really shouldn't get anyone's panties in a bunch so badly that every single instance of it on /a/ gets called out by a dozen "Fuck offs," which are ten times as annoying as the ellipses was to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br> this is what faggots with shit tier taste actually believe </br>  <br>Self-confidence?

If he wasn't confident, he'd be sitting in a corner calling himself worthless like that faggot from Mirai Nikki. He still thinks he's clever and deserves shit. He'll continue to act in his own interests.</br>  <br>  Did you see how crushed he was after he was dumped? <br>His ego got damaged but recovered quickly, after all he didn't care for the girl that much.</br></br>  <br> trying to fit in <br><br>You just did all the work for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, faggot.

Regardless though, I still misused it. <br><br>Just because something didn't happen does not necessarily mean the other did. I could just as easily say that because he didn't have a monologue psyching himself up afterward, he's no longer confident. <br><br>He didn't even notice blondie letting herself into his apartment or whatever because he was still thinking about getting dumped. That's not a quick recovery or a girl that he didn't care about.<br><br>You may have the support of trips but a few posts here saves a shit load elsewhere if I were to do the same thing in a bigger thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking pedo. How could u get off to the idea of removing a little girl's clothes and licking her tiny body all over, nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples? Only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva, pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts, the cum more than her little throat can swallow. The idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down her chin over her flat chest, her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to her pure, tight, virginal pussy, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum, while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one quick stroke.<br>I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours. It is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her, feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest, her neck and her armpits, savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax, hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her, pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her freshly-deflowered pussy for the first time, filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop her flushed body, she sighs breathlessly and her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside her again. Sick fuck.</br></br>  <br>Thank you so much.

The only thing similar about the two characters is that their special power bullshit allows them to compel others to do something (and even then, Lelouche's was way stronger in every way) and both of them have visual cues on the eyes to tell the audience when it's used. Their personality, motivations, and everything else that matters are very different. <br><br>Yes I'm the same guy from the other thread. Prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah she turned cold as fuck in an instant.</br>  <br> Best girl will never win the hentaibowl <br>I don't understand why shows like that exist. What's the point of getting a bunch of cute girls who want the MC's dick when he just chooses the worst one and the rest all suffer?</br></br>  <br>I felt so pissed when that student council bitch ruined everything, hoping she suffers. But I guess he gets to suffer for getting caught</br>  <br>bitch just showed her true colors.</br>  <br>Is this logical thinking?</br>  <br>This, I hope the studio burns.</br>  <br>She was nice to him and took him out for lunch because he just saved her life. Then he ditches her and runs away, and all of a sudden he's acting like they should be together when they barely know each other, because it was part of his plan. Nigga came across as creepy as shit.</br>  Tomori is a bitch  <br>Do you think she makes "home videos"?</br>  <br> wanting P.A. Works to burn <br>I want you to burn.</br></br>  <br><br>This is just my crazy theory but I think her red-haired friend has a power that lets her control minds to some extent, as in making them believe what she says. Yumi didn´t quite realize what happened at the beggining then immedeatly starts lusting for MC's dick, as in begging him to come to eat pancakes. That'd explain her change of personality because red-haired friend's influence faded.</br></br>      <br>I don't know about that, but while I do think Yumi's going to become irrelevant, I'm almost certain Red is going to come back.</br>  <br>Just noticed the Houshinoumi logo in her uniform. Nice.<br><br>Awesome premise, music and animation all around, PA Works is finally back to its top form.</br></br></br>  <br> PA Works is finally back to its top form <br><br>What about Shirobako?</br></br></br>  Is this 13 episodes? We all saw what happened to Angel Beats...  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=D3r<wbr>NBAMt-kg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Mediocre, visually unimpressive and also unrealistic considering the setting it had.</br>   tfw i have no sister <br><br>;_;</br></br>  <br> We all saw what happened to Angel Beats.. <br> Top selling and most popular Key IP <br> Top selling and most popular PAWorks IP <br><br>Why do you think Charlotte even came to exist?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she makes animal videos.</br>  <br> best imouto ever <br> not even a best imouto this season </br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean it was handled well.</br>  <br>It means hipster opinions mean jackshit beyond the hipster bubble that is this shithole.</br>  <br>Not him but just because it sold well doesn't mean the show was good, retard. It had potential and some moments, but nothing ever delivered and had no sense of direction at all.</br>  They clearly gave the most OP half assed ability to the MC, HOW FUCKING UNCOMMON.<br><br>He can easily just kill them if he wants too, 5 seconds is enough.</br></br>  <br>I imagine she'd have this expression during sex.</br>  <br>she looks like a shit potato</br>  <br><br>yu's power have so much more potential than Light's death note you faggot<br>I'm mad because first it looks like a better version of Death Note but then it becomes some magic high school bull shit</br></br></br>  <br>What happens if he kills himself in the 5 seconds?</br>  Why does she speak like this?  From the shadow of SMUG, a new empress is born  <br>She's got a long way to go if she wants to overthrow last season's queen of smug.</br>  <br> MC would have been a real criminal if he wasn't so fucking retarded <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>She did.</br>  <br>I would totally have.</br>  <br>n-nano desu</br>  Anyone realize that the imouto speaks with "de gozaru" at the end of her sentences?<br>Do you think she's just eccentric or is it related to her power?</br>  <br>I feel you bro, say goodbye to your "easy" life, public life that is.At least he didn't go full crazy and tried to kill the girl using the dude.</br>  <br>How will that happen? He's controlling the other guy.</br>  <br> Lelouche's was way stronger in every way </br>  <br>my Dad remarried a nip and I can confirm this, and that he's a beta faggot because of it</br>  <br> trying to kill her using glasses-kun <br> Tomori just turns off glasses-kun visual perception until the 5 seconds are over <br><br>Tomori is super effective against Yu, he has zero chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Moe as fuck</br>  <br>The last thread had more buttmad people. You might have liked that one more. <br><br>He can't control someone that he can't see and he can't see invisibitch or the teleporting guy if they activate their abilities. He also cabt control more than one person at a time so the chances kf him killing 2 people are slim. Also why would he kill them? That'd be pretty out of character for him.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just tap into Tomori and make her jump from the building.<br>Surely those 5 seconds will be over before she falls.</br></br>  <br>a bitch heroine and a faggot MC<br>please staph Maeda, please</br></br>  <br>That wasn't confidence. That was an ego.<br>The MC strikes me as cowardly and weak person, and that's before the student council showed up.</br></br>  <br>When?</br>  How many commercial trucks have been SUPPORTING CHARACTERS in anime so far?  <br>When he was in the student council room retaking his exam? That wouldn't be a very far fall. The pavement is pretty much horizontal from the window's view.</br>  <br>I meant from his new house</br>  <br>It'd be a little late to murder them at that point, anon. His secret was already out.</br>  Is there going to be incest in this?  How old is imouto?  <br>Then maybe in the lake?<br>Could he possibly make her drown in 5 seconds?</br></br>  <br> Key <br>What do you think?</br></br>  <br>old enough.</br>  <br>Is that a no or a yes?</br>  <br>Not unless he conveniently already had a ton of cinder blocks tied to some netting laid out on some dock that he could roll her up in and jump into the lake with, all in 5 seconds.<br><br>And last I checked he didn't plan on skydiving into that lake with glasses kun.</br></br></br>  Best girl.  I want to beat her up, rape her and then steal her camcorder.  <br> not stealing the camcorder then filming you fuck her <br>You had one job.</br></br>  <br><br>I like your theory.</br></br>  <br>He can control the dude and kill the invisible chick. It's not like they have their habilitied activated all the time</br>  <br>The invisible chick can then make herself invisible to the dude and kill him.</br>  <br>Did she came from Air?</br>  <br>Alright how about this, get a gun into the hand of the teleport dude, take his body over, shoot Sue Storm in the fucking face, toss gun back to self just in time to pick it up and shoot teleporting dude as he's briefly stunned by the sight of the chick with the top of her head blown off.</br>  The exam didn't even seem to be mathematical.<br>Did he not even look at the questions he answered?</br>  <br>Yeah that was a total scrub move, if you take an exam once and learn the answer to every single question, you should really be able to do it again without cheating and at least get a 90.</br>  <br>Good luck shooting someone you can't see.</br>  <br> shoot Sue Storm in the fucking face <br>How? She already became invisible</br></br>  <br><br>But if she made herself invisible to MC, he would be able to see her from teleporter dude's body, wouldn't he?</br></br>  <br>We'll see. If her power targets the "soul" rather than a physical body, then even if MC were to keep switching he wouldn't see her. In this episode, for example, he hadn't seen her before she revealed herself to him despite him switching with other people in the same room as her.</br>  Just watched the first episode and holy shit was that first have up to Nao's introduction fantastic. MC was a smug Kanye and a complete piece of shit. I loved it.<br><br>Second half with the changing of schools was kind of a bummer, overall this starter episode was a perfect hook.<br><br>MC needs to stay a smug bastard until the end or I will wind up very disappointed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope we get a good balance of the MC being a smug little shit and messing with people and him falling on his ass and getting slapped around by the other people in the school council.</br>  <br>That's a good point, I forgot he didn't see her when he took over the seitokaicho's body. That must be how it works then, unless he was really just that distracted by the porn he was holding.</br>  <br>It's been this way for a LONG time.</br>  <br>I have to wonder why /a/ keeps going back to anime that has the same themes. It's like women who constantly get into relationships with guys who drink a lot and beat them. You would think "we" would learn our lesson eventually, but we keep coming back to the same ol' same old shit.<br><br>Moefags didn't ruin the industry, it was people who kept giving the illusion that it was popular. People who wanted more quirky grills in their Chinese cartoons. People in general.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty funny that "school" is a genre. I can't really think of any other medium where you'll find that as a genre tag in like half the entries in that medium.</br>  <br>She's already imouto of the season. Maybe even loli of the season too.<br><br>Also, her third person speech is moe as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense for Japan to have "school" be a genre. That's half their life, doing shit in school for university. Going through hell of exams, just to be another number in a box designed to be just as bad as school. Dogs and Demons is an excellent book, but it puts it all into perspective what kind of messed up culture Japan has. I honestly cannot find it in my heart to blame anyone there for being a social outcast, since it's almost impossible to make it the legitimate way.</br>  <br>It's not really cute, since it smacks of "special snowflake" crap that most moé shit is.</br>  <br>Nah her 3rd person speech is fucking retarded. If I knew a girl like that in real life I would avoid her like the plague.</br>  <br>She'll grow fox ears and tail soon enough.</br>  If I take away the camcorder, will she die?  <br>I think it would [REC] her badly.</br>  <br>I hope the MC possesses her and just fucking hurls it against a wall or something.</br>  <br>It's called 3DPD for a reason</br>  <br>top rek</br>  <br>trips confirm.</br>   there are people who wouldn't watch a show because they don't like the MC <br>Do you watch shows for a good story or to make imaginary friends?</br>  <br>to self-insert, is there other reason?</br>  I don't really get you guys, /a/.<br><br>You're always going on about how you all hate generic SAO male protagonists, but then an MC comes up who looks like he's going to veer away from the norm, and everyone shouts 'Edgy!'.</br></br>  <br>People watch fate, and that one have no good story, but it has a harem. So yeah, people watch things to self-insert.</br>  <br>Not "everyone", just a vocal minority.<br>This is probably the best rated first episode of the new season so far.</br></br>  Kinda unrelated but can anyone here read japanese?<br><br> I'm trying to communicate with a seller and I think I said something really fucked up or something happened and I don't know whats going on any more.</br></br>  <br>It would be extremely painful.</br>  <br>For you.</br>  <br>possesses her and break her virginity<br>now that would be both extremely painful AND fun</br></br>  <br>If she turns invisible while youre fucking her, will your dick be visible or not?</br>  <br/>  Why does she look like GGO kirito  <br> he was manipulating Yumi to love him <br>He really wasn't. At best, what he did was a rather elaborate trick to break the ice and have them meet. Aside from its scale, it's really not much different from spilling a drink or tripping or whatever else people do to accidentally™ start talking with a girl. <br><br>The only deceitful thing are his grades. Yumi may have found his grades and the supposed effort he puts towards achieving them to be attractive when it's in fact nothing but a hoax. Cheating is a very real life skill in the world though, and I am sure it could have been cleared up later some time down the line eventually. <br><br>But that's aside the point. The point is that he never manipulated her. He just presented himself as a man with achievements he doesn't technically have.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are Megashite's subs better than CR's?  <br> is anything better than CR <br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>As long as they aren't localised to shit like CR's were I'll be happy  de gozaru </br>  So what's with the comet(?) in the logo?

This is an Aniplex's script, not an in-house translation, this is just the production company not knowing their own materials.</br></br></br></br>  Just watched nico stream and find out there's episode 2 preview, seems preview will release after nico aired  <br> when it's used. <br>They both have a real soft spot for their little sisters who they consider to be their only real family. <br>They both grin, smile, and laugh manically. <br>They were both confident to a fault. <br>And the way he tries to analyze everything bis also reminiscent of Lelouch. <br>Not to mention how they aren't too dissimilar visually. <br><br>I don't even care much for Lelouch and Yu has in one episode almost been more entertaining already. But you can't honestly argue that there are no similarities, can you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Tomori going to be the new Kanade?

ZEHAHAHAHA     <br> What topics do you hope will be brought up in this post/pre arc period? <br><br>I want them to go to Wano and discovering that Kaido is abusing people here as sex slaves. Both males and females</br></br></br>  Reminder that law doesn't know that they have to deal with big mom right now  <br> law wakes up <br> learns about Big mom rampaging on Dressrosa's coast <br> goes back to sleep <br>Somehow I got the feeling that at this point he won't even find it in himself to care.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy won the lawbowl so now law just has to accept things like this</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>FemApoo always turns me on for some reason.</br>  <br> 5 years from now a coverstory about Bon chan and Doflamingo breaking out of Impel Down will start <br>Yes, please.</br></br>  <br>It's the teeth</br>  <br>and the glasses</br>    <br>I wish to know how many of the people/crews on the island will pledge allegiance/fealty to the Strawhats and/or Law Pirates. Specifically Cabbage and Barto. <br><br>I want CP0 to be addressed as well.<br><br>Lastly would be nice for Doffy to talk about the Treasure of the Celestial Dragons back at the Holy land.</br></br></br></br></br>  So we know there will be another female crew member. The question is will she be able to top Nami and Robin in lewdness?  <br>Robin is lewd, but there is nothing lewd about Nami. <br><br>She's a slut that would fuck a aids ridden fat old guy for money and her bitchy attitude is a turn off.</br></br></br>  <br> I wish to know how many of the people/crews on the island will pledge allegiance/fealty to the Strawhats and/or Law Pirates <br>All of them. Though there will be various degrees of honesty and tsun about these pledges.</br></br>  <br>CP0'S GONE. THEY LEFT DRESSROSA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ARC.</br>  <br>I just hope for a different body type. Flat or fat, loli or granny, lewd or not, I don't care, I'm just tired of hourglasses.</br>  Well Doffy brought up some secret the Gorosei are keeping under wraps that he was after.<br><br>Also the implication that the ope ope fruit was used before to make people immortal kinda hints at the Gorosei being alive since the void century. <br><br>Also the D clan thing would be interesting to hear about more.<br><br>Hopefully Dragon will now pop up in the story more since we have Sabo reconnecting with Luffy.<br><br>I think that realistically the Big Mom situation will make the strawhats rush off the island real fast so we won't get much in the way of exposition and small talk.<br><br>I'm hoping that Jinbei catches up with the crew since he's awesome and it's about time he joins up proper.<br><br>On top of that it would be good to find out about the remaining admiral and shichibukai and see Akainu react to Fuji's behavior on Dresrossa.<br><br>No to mention that it's a perfect time to introduce Kaido as he reacts to the SMILE operation being wiped out by the strawhats.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   sabo doesn't murder burgess <br><br>o-okay</br></br>  God I wish you newfags would just realize the truth. I don't know why people still watch this series. Every arc is just a ripoff of a Disney movie. Do you people really like this?  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127656377 <br> tripfags </br></br>  <br>Hopefully more about the Will of the D.</br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  <br><br><br>I like how Law becomes utterly confused with the chaos that is Strawhat, but ends up being overpowered by Luffy's will anyway. I almost want him to stay as the only sane member of the crew just to watch him go nuts and try to keep up because "I owe this kid. I owe this kid. God, I owe this kid. WHY" Not gonna happen, though. He has his own crew whose hearts I don't want to be broken.</br></br></br>  what if luffy grew up around doffy instead of shanks?  <br>Law doesn't owe him shit</br>  <br>Well, maybe. It's just fun to think about.</br>  <br>He would be just as insane as he is now, just not as nice.</br>  <br> <br>Kid sure is a lewd girl</br></br>  we need to know more about that secret national treasure in mariejois.  <br>You have plenty of time to guess cause we're not seeing it until the Reverie most likely.</br>  Hardcore Chopper.   "Quick Robin, distract them with your fat tits!"     <br> that hammer going through the trophy </br>  <br>i need some nude filter action like with nami and rebecca</br>   Robin qualified for dominant lead heroine <br> you will never have even an alternate universe manga with Robin as the lead heroine <br> Robin wont guide your way in that manga </br></br>  I'm supposed to be watching OP with a friend so he can enjoy the series (I already read the manga), but I watched the Davy Back fights without him and don't wanna rewatch them. It's been a while since I've been through that part. If we just skip that part and jump straight to aokiji, is there anything my friend would be missing out on that's important? I don't remember Foxy having any point at all besides silly fun shit.  <br>Then One Piece would be about the Sunglasses Pirates and their captain Monkey D. Luffy, wielder of the Ope Ope no mi.</br>  <br>I mean I guess not anything crazy, it's an off part of the story but I feel it's still pretty crucial to what One Piece is<br> Kuzan ties together the long ring island arc and you would just be skipping the meat in the middle <br><br>But up to you</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you just have him watch that part without you? Or fucking whip out your phone or something and dick around while he watches, I dunno, man. Why deprive your friend from any element of One Piece just because you already saw it.</br>  <br>Skip it it really doesn't affect the story in any way</br>  <br>Anime actually makes Kuzan happen on a separate filler island, so skipping to him would literally leave out nothing of the Water 7 arc.<br><br><br>I told him he could borrow my dvds but he was the one that suggested skipping it for now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, there's that fight with Aojiki right after<br><br>It introduces some of the bigger concepts for the next arc and backstory for others</br></br></br>  <br>Such as? I can't remember the details, it's been a long time since I read through water 7. That's why I asked.</br>  <br>poor Romeo looks like a piece of paper<br><br>Why doesnt Barto get Dynamic Abs Shading Toei?</br></br></br>  <br>love where the budget goes to</br>  ITT : Stuff that Oda manages to hide perfectly<br>Her being a mermaid</br>  <br>Sabo?</br>  What if the Strawhat is One Piece?  <br><br> Recently reading a physical copy of the manga at the library for kicks <br> Read one of Oda's answers to questions <br> One of them mentions how hidden behind some promotional text on the cover story for ace's grave there are three sake cups </br></br></br></br>  Start getting hype.  <br>Sanji's eye<br><br>no one had ANY idea what was going on behind that fringe until Oda decided to move it</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy versus Drake imminent?<br><br>i'm down</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy ripping Drake's jaw off in g4 confirmed</br>  <br>Law being a D?</br>  <br> ITT : Stuff that Oda manages to hide perfectly <br><br>his true nature</br></br></br>  <br>He's not even looking anywhere near his ass.</br>  <br> manages to hide perfectly </br>  <br>im sorry for having started the ant zoan thing...now this fucker posts in every single thread</br>  Im keeping up with the manga but forgot everything relating to drake. Can someone bring me up to date on any backstory,his past etc?  <br>used to be a marine<br>now he's a dinosaur who may or may not be riding Kaido's dick</br></br>  <br>How do i forget moments like this, this is awesome, why did he have the sword again? Any other forgotten awesome moments out there?</br>  <br>Zoro got rekt (by Lucci iirc) and dropped his sword while falling to some far place</br>  <br>His papa was a meanie pirate who tried to sell the Ope-ope fruit. They got fucked over, Drake was rescued by the marines and he joined them. When he was a rear admiral he realized that WG is fucked up and became a pirate instead. Then he fucked around on one of Kaido's islands, then joined him.</br>  <br> tripfag <br> pasta <br>ayy lmao</br></br></br>  I don't understand what Cobra realized at that moment  <br>He realized that the killing of people who could read the poneglyphs might have been dumb?</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>I wasn't telling you, I was suggesting it. Hence the question mark.</br>  <br>Then why did we protect something potentially dangerous from the WG even though we're supposed to e on their side. <br>That's because his family was a mole/on the Ancient Kingdom's side, the Alabasta royal family refusing to go to Mariejois after the void century is enough proof of that.</br></br>  <br>Chimney</br>  <br>we dont talk about that</br>  So, since ope ope users obviously are able to operate on themselves, and they are able to give their life to perform an immortality operation: could Law make himself immortal by dying for himself?  <br>No, he's not Jesus.</br>  <br> could Law make himself immortal by dying <br> immortal by dying <br><br>Somehow I don't think it works that way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No no, Jesus did it differently: he got himself killed for himself to make everyone else immortal since he would just resurrect and is immortal anyway.<br>Or maybe Jesus does have the ope ope no mi. Makes you think, hu?<br><br><br>Not with that attitude, atleast.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's like, Jesus died for other people so he could be immortal and then make others "immortal" after they died.</br>  <br>But he died so God would forgive the primeval sin, or sin in general, since he took all of Earth's sin on himself. Like, he was Kuma'ing the sin out of everyone who folloed him and went full Zoro on it, which he could do since he was God. So he sacrificed himself to himself.</br>  <br>Yes, he sacrificed himself to himself for others. He also used the Ope Ope fruit to perform all of his miracles. And that is the end of the theological discussion.</br>  <br>So, basically he used the immortality operation on himself, died, became immortal, and can now grant eternal life since he wouldn't die anymore during the immortality operation. Clever bastard.<br><br>For real though, the gonosei, did they get immortality treatment?</br></br></br>  <br>The Gorosei are just five dudes with a lot of power, politically speaking.</br>  <br>Yeah, but that'd be boring. I imagine them to be somewhat like the father of the homunculi of FMA or something.</br>  <br>You're free to imagine.</br>  <br>Oh god, me too. And then Law starts acting strange until eventually he reaches his breaking point and we find out Doffy used to rape him.<br> Including detailed flashback, please. </br></br>  <br>im fairly certain someone has already done that doujin</br>  <br>I know, I've read them all.

You can partially see the kid in that pic, too.</br>  <br><br><br>I'm really hoping either "difficult/shichibukai" (https://<span>youtu.be/e4K69gXQHNg)  [ ] or "lets battle" (https://<span>youtu.be/TI42KgLcaWY)  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I always thought she was Mexican pre TS.</br>  <br>I don't think 'Difficult' would play for Luffy winning. It's more of an 'oh shit' moment theme. 'Luffy vs Ratchet', however would be fucking badass if they do it right. Like Luffy's Red Hawk against Hody. The anime did that scene major justice.<br><br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ofoJx<wbr>hLHPN8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>They might use this too, since they seem to like using this a little. Kyros beheading Doffy with this was amazing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm hoping it's a brand new OST</br></br>  I can see them playing Augus' Theme again. (Dunno what it is called in One Piece, and I also don't know what the original composition is called. So I just remember the name it had in Asura's Wrath.)  <br>When was it played ?<br><br><br>Their new soundtracks are awesome but I'm worried if they'll fuck it up. I know they're pretty good with soundtracks for the most part but still.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You obviously refer New World Symphony, 4th Movement.</br>  <br>When Croc was kill. There were quite a few parallels between Doff and Croc, so I can see them putting the icing on the cake.<br><br><br>I guess.

Why didn't he make them train more? How could he hope to become the Pirate King with weaklings like that?  <br>kuina<br> strong <br> cheeky  <br> confident  <br>tashigi <br> stupid <br> clumsy  <br> not confident at all <br> glasses </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kuina herself believed that she'd get weaker.</br>  <br>He's the ban evading Luccifag.</br>  <br>No, seriously, weaker obviously, that's why her father killed her</br>   #1 swordsman is european style <br> #2 swordsman is european style too </br>  <br>Who's number 2?</br>  <br>vista</br>  <br>Since when?</br>  <br>Bullshit nigger, I started it</br>  <br>Vista is trash.<br><br>Mihawk literally slapped Vista's shit while thinking long and hard about Luffy's secret power.<br><br>Mihawk fully concentrated on Zoro at beginning of the series.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How could he hope to become the Pirate King with weaklings like that? <br>I'm pretty sure the seats thought they were grooming him to become the PK while Doffy was just interested in destroying the world, Law even mocks Trebol by saying Doffy is just using them like puppets after his "muh King Doffy" flashback</br></br>  When momo grows up well be be the most powerful zoan type?  <br>No, she'd be weaker because she's a female and this is a brutal world where men reign and women know their place<br><br>Yes, Oda is that sexist</br></br></br>  <br> that's why her father killed her </br>  <br>There is nothing sexist about actual facts. Women have 30% less muscles than men, they're physically fragile. Swordsmanship is all about reflex, agility etc, women who perform that are doomed on arrival.</br>  Wait.<br><br>Wait.<br><br>Koala is Koala. As in, Fisher Tiger's Koala. How the fuck did I not see that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her father killed her because he didn't want to give his top sword to a woman.<br><br><br>All we know is that she was in fact older than him, and for smaller children even one year is a world of a difference.<br>Only thing we can know about Zoro's strength is that it would probably be much smaller, due to the missing motivation.<br><br><br>He ate the stair stair no mi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that stupid slave girl who never stopped smiling.</br>  <br> Mihawk fully concentrated on Zoro at beginning of the series. <br>u wot m8</br></br>  <br> men have more muscles, they're stronger <br> swordsmanship relies on reflex, agility, etc <br> thus women are doomed when it comes to swordmanship <br>I don't think reflex and agility are brute strength dependent.<br>But let's not get technical here. Whatever the truth, I still think it's stupid to give women such a handicap in a series where people can turn into gum or fire and create earthquakes. Moreover the most potent force in One Piece is willpower. Anyone is able to overcome their shortcomings with sheer willpower, so why wouldn't women be able to overcome their lack of muscles ? When I look at Tashigi and her resolve, I think she should be strong, yet Oda keeps shitting on her.</br></br></br></br></br>   Trafalgar D. Water Law <br> Water Law <br> Waterloo </br></br>  Am I the only one who genuinely thinks that Rebecca will join the SH crew?  <br>Welcome to 8 months ago.</br>  <br>You don't believe it either, so the mathematical answer to your question can only be no.</br>  <br>More like 10 months ago<br><br>Damn it feels like yesterday</br></br></br>  <br>Tashigi ? What's her resolve ? To get a bunch of swords from criminals. What's Zoro's ? To be the best in the goddamn World. Better than literally anyone. Of course Tashigi is going to get shat on. Her dream doesn't compare to Zoro's. And Kuina had already pretty much given up. She was crying, claiming that she'd definitely be weaker. She had no will at all. If you want to see strong willed women, look at Rouge. What she did was fucking impossible and even Sengoku knows it.</br>  <br>Still one of the worst names in One Piece. Just Trafalgar Law was fine.</br>  <br> Trafalgar Law <br> Trafalgar <br><br>HOLY SHIT GUYS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and that's why Kaido is likely to have a Napoleon theme</br>  <br>It's going to be Gaimon's fucking brother, isn't it.</br>  <br>He already has a beast theme.<br><br><br>Yuwhat m8?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyros said that he protected Rebecca so that she won't have to fight anymore,</br>  <br>He can have a beast theme and be based on napolen....both Scotch and Drake wear french musketeer like hats.</br>  <br>If he is french he will likely be a dolphin, since the gayest animal on earth was already defeated.</br>  <br>Dolphins are smart enough to enjoy rape. Surely they have nothing in common with the French.</br>  <br>Gaimon, the short midget stuck in a box ?</br>  <br>Didn't Gen say something similar about Nami?</br>  <br>Nami doesn't really fight anything though. She is only involved in soapy rapes.</br>  <br>I think he made Luffy promise to protect her smile.<br>Or something.</br></br>  <br>Box midget is Kaido's brother? What're you basing this on?</br>  That giant who was with Rayleigh during the human auction, did he ever show up again?  <br>It was a joke, you funless bastard. A joke on being short.</br>  <br>Didn't he join Magneto?</br>  <br>Well he said he's going to pay back his debt to the strawhats or something.</br>  <br>I think that's kinda the problem with One Piece now. I sure as fuck can't remember what happened two hundred chapters ago. I'm pretty hazy on what happened to Sunny/Sanji&amp;co to be honest and that can't've been more than a couple of dozen chapters ago. Problem is that amounts to about half a year in real time.</br>  <br>There is no proof he joined kaido</br>  Is Oda a hack?<br><br>Why does he get so much praise for milking his One Piece of SHIT.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Here.<br><br><br>That's why you go back and re-read stuff. It goes by pretty quickly and you tend to notice stuff as long as you don't blitz through it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll be at Elbaf for sure</br>  <br>Nami was so fucking sexy.</br>  <br>Here's a reply.</br>  <br> Tfw Elbaf is just a troll and will never be expanded upon. </br>  <br>You lying piece of shit, I started it.</br>  <br> Napoleon theme <br> King of the beasts <br><br>Guys<br>GUYS<br>What if he's a fucking imperial eagle?<br>A cruel strong naturalborn killer,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He could be a Griffin since the lion part could be the king of beasts.</br>  So who do you all actually think might not be straight? Not in your fujoshit minds, but like, genuinely. Let's hear your shitty headcanons.  <br>Nami. She got turned on by Kalifa and kinda sorta eyed up Vivi.</br>  <br>No romance in One Piece. Shippers out.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese need their own version of Disney movies</br>  <br>Yeah, Studio Ghibli.</br>  <br>Never gonna happen. Giants and Elbaf are the one thing that's always popped up somewhat consistently. The chance of it being a troll is the same as Wano being one.</br>  <br>That was Jean Bart<br>And he joined the Heart pirates not Kidd<br><br>The giant from auction house just dipsetted, I don't think we even get his name</br></br></br></br>  <br>But we sure as shit are gonna see him and Usopp talking about something in the future.</br>  <br> tripfag <br><br>-He attacked kaidos man on favorite island to clearly get attention from him<br>-was former marine so used to working under people<br>-is a trex which would fit perfectly into kaidos theme<br>-places another supernova in luffys path down grand line and was slightly foreshadowed by laws flashback that we will be seeing more of drake<br><br>Can't be proven and could very well not be true but I say it's a good chance</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jean Bart and Usopp talking about something in the future <br><br>Enlighten me. Why will Jean Bart and Usopp talk in the future and what will it be about?????</br></br></br>  <br><br>So... Napoleon lost at Waterloo, right? Against two allied fleets? Am I right?</br></br>  Any news on the status of the digital coloured manga? <br>Last thing i heard was someone mentioning that it would continue once Jump would be done with colouring some other manga.</br>  Dragon is the worst designed OP character. I hope he gets a redesign  <br>I meant Giant, bro.</br>  <br>Battle of Trafalgar = English defeating the Spanish (Doflaming) and French (Napoleon) alliance</br>  <br> those two guys from Enies Lobby <br> Hadjrudin <br> Slave giant  <br> connection to Dorry and Brogy <br>I never see this posted, but the Elbaf warriors are almost guaranteed to be Luffy's allies in the end. <br>I hope Elbaf is a Skypeia type arc, just a depress adventure from the rest of the world</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will Bartolomeo join the Crew?<br><br>What do YOU think, and why?</br></br>  <br>I honestly think the Elbaf arc will involve the unknown shichibukai, it would be strange to have a Yonko have Elbaf as their territory but who knows how their society works.</br>  <br>Thank you, anon. I'm glad I got it right somehow.</br>  <br>So Law will die (some anon said so about the historical character he's impersonating, lost arm etc) but luffy will win?<br>Can anyone confirm the Law's death theory?</br></br>  <br>No he won't, he has his own crew and abandoning it would go completely against the ideals he so greatly looks up to in Luffy.</br>  <br>Do you stupid cunts even read One Piece</br>  <br> start of elbaf arc <br> elbaf turns out to actually be a pretty tiny island filled to the brim with giants <br> all the giants just standing around shoulder on shoulder, the ones on the coast trying not to fall into the sea <br> the sunny just sails past it and the giants with ties to the strawhats are waving <br> end of elbaf arc <br><br>Do it Oda!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, okay. My bad.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Okay, I can't take it anymore. Someone explain this to me. Which historic guy is Law parallel to?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would it be strange for a Yonko to have control over Elbaf ? Even Luffy could solo a giant pre-TS.</br>  <br>Jean Dark</br>  <br>Dory and Broggy are proud of Elbaf and it didn't seem opressed by the way they described it, then again they are very old.<br><br>The Enies Lobby giants didn't mention it either.<br><br>Giants are proud warriors and I'm sure there'll be strong ones at Elbaf, also Hajrudin wants to be the Giant King, meaning they have some sort of a king or a respected title given to the strongest Giant. Then again the Giant King could be controlled by a Yonko so who knows honestly...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He attacked scotch because he wanted to meet kaido and take him down</br>  <br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2014/12/<wbr>16/chao-time-the-meaning-behind-tra<wbr>falgar-law/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Oh, right. Yea, I think it might be a little like Wano, in that regard. I guess most Islands are under a Yonko's flag for protection and Elbaf most likely don't need said protection. <br><br>I just can't properly imagine a Giant as an antagonist though. I'm sure Oda could deliver but I'm guessing Luffy will have some kinda 'overmind'-ish villain, who isn't a giant. <br><br>Just speculation, of course.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Presumably. Or he just wanted to show Kaido that he was strong enough to be an ally. He defeated Caribou after Caribou defeated Scotch.</br>  <br> those vagina bones <br> on a boy </br></br>  <br>I'm still mad that Drake lost his hat</br>  <br>What was Caribou's bounty again?<br><br>300 hajchumonkee belly?</br></br></br>  <br>$$210,000,000</br>  <br>Oh I swear I thought it was around 300 to 310 hajchumonkee bellies.<br><br>Caribou is weak as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>He might still have it on standby if his hair gets messed up.<br><br><br>210m.

There was a thread on it a while ago  </br>    <br>Nah, he made it pretty clear to her even after she confessed her love for him as a man that he only sees her as his cute sister but that he would never abandon her or leave her side. He said he'd try to see her as more than his sister but makes no guarantee. In his head, no matter how much they've been altered genetically so that even their kids won't have defects, he says the fact that we are brother and sister from the same parents doesn't change. He can't reconcile this fact and he isn't capable of romantic love thus far.</br>  <br>Yet he doesn't because he only sees her as a sister. He can really fuck any girl he wants really with as many that like him in the series. Mayumi practically offered herself in a hotel room to him, he just undressed her quickly and left.</br>  <br>Why is he holding a silly toy gun.</br>  <br>not be a faggot gary stu</br>  <br>He can't post translations on BT</br>  <br>He teases him about it for sure:<br><br>The wheel fell out at the same time. The barrels fell and guns displaced. Armorplate peeled of all at once. These all happened in the same time at the 4 tanks.<br><br>Fuel leaked from the engines.<br><br>It ascended to the sky and vaporized prior to ignition, as it mixed and diffused tothe atmosphere.<br><br>“Good work”<br><br>“It doesn’t make me happy tobe complemented by you”<br><br>Towards Masaki’s cold attitude, Tatsuya smirked wickedly.<br><br>“Should I ask Miyuki to complement you?”<br><br>“Do-don’t joke around! It’s not the time for that!”<br><br>Masaki was upset about an interesting thing.<br><br>“At any rate, let’s go! Zhou Gongjin is escaping.... It’s him!”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>Tatsuya extended his ‘eye’ towards the direction of Masaki’s sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  is that psychopass... just kidding  <br>That's because he knows that he already belongs to the Miyuki.</br>  <br>Not in the way she wants. Tatsuya isn't her doormat, he clearly runs the show and Maya knows it.</br>  <br> Adopted grandson.  </br>  <br>Wait he undressed her? So he got her down to her underwear or nude and just said "no thanks" and left her there thinking they were going to bang?</br>  <br><br> Not in the way she wants. <br>He hasn't realized that yet. It's only a matter of time.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, got her down to her underwear and roughly threw her in bed then left. The next day she complained that he undressed her too roughly.</br>  <br>That's how hard she lost, huh? Not even surprised. That explains why Mayumifags are so mad.</br>  <br>If he hasn't realized it in 16 volumes, he isn't going to realize it any more than he has. He's got limited emotions and he already said he'd be by her side and never abandon her. As far as he's concerned, he's complying with her wishes and doing what he wants at the same time. He's happy seeing her as his cute little sister, he doesn't need anything else. And she's fine as long as he never abandons her or thinks she'd abnormal. Really, their relationship hasn't changed one bit since the beginning. Read the translations for volume 16, despite their engagement, they have remained the same. It's others who are perceiving it differently. <br><br>What I don't get is why Maya announced him as her son to the TMC. Isn't her ex going to know that's a load of bullshit?</br></br></br>  Cut inside  <br>Wow Tatsuya is a gives no fucks dick and Mayumi is absolutely pathetic</br>  President ends up with him right? Not that Jumanji scum  <br>Jumanji is based as fuck</br>  <br>"I can't hold my liquor much, but I'm the type who remembers everything" <br><br>Tatsuya wanted to flee that place in that very moment. Unfortunately for him, he understood that he couldn't do that in such situation as a man . <br><br>"…though I feel that you don't have to be that rough" <br><br>Certainly, he did shove Mayumi to the bed roughly. However, could he be blamed because of that? He questioned himself when he recalled. Yet, to say 'you're the one who want to strip to your underwear' be a king cobra grade boomerang. <br><br>Mayumi was still looking at Tatsuya shyly. <br><br>In this very awkward atmosphere, it was a mental hard work to send Mayumi back to the nearest station to go home, while Tatsuya waited at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We aren't sure who ends up with who at this point, though wouldn't surprise me if her father makes her engagement to Juumonji official next volume.</br>  He can't stop being a fag long enough to fuck his sister that's for sure  How can such an old man make such a great LN?  <br>Ok so she was coming on to him while wasted and wanted to ride his baloney pony and he didn't want to take advantage of a drunk chick who wasn't his immuto</br>  <br>He's a 58 year old chuuni. Some just never grow up.</br>  <br> tfw his new editor made him drop the public transport system of the future </br>  <br>I don't think he would have slept with her even if she was sober. And he doesn't want to fuck his sister either. He was in Kyoto on a specific mission, he has no time for silly grills and their whims.</br>  <br>Not a chance, it's still going strong as of the latest volume. Public transport end is one we can safely say will happen.</br>  <br>He got a new editor?</br>  <br>that's what i heard from 2ch</br>  <br>Since when?</br>  <br>Updated to reflect the loss then.</br>  <br>I think his old editor was the Oreimo one so we have no clue about this new one.</br>  <br>Yeah, it was the man who helped our lord and savior with the Oreo. Pretty much confirms to me that Miyuki won't be winning.</br>  <br>Mahouka will turn into a wholesome family values LN about what it means to be a true patriot.</br>   Kirito smacks tats a little <br> He straight up breaks the game code <br>Calm down nigga</br></br>  <br>Is that what happens in the crossover?</br>  <br>Yeah, Tatsuya was pretty upset he lost and wanted a rematch with the Blackswordsman.</br>  <br>Doushio~</br>  <br>What did Tatsuya think would happen? He can't beat somebody in a video game, he's a total scrub, that's one of his only weaknesses.</br>  <br>Don't forget Kirito's VR reflexes are the best in the world save for Aids-chan. Kirito can reflect whatever magic bullshit Oniisama can throw his way right back at him, at speeds that would make Accelerator and the Flash jealous.</br>  <br>I guess Tatsuya really doesn't like to lose either. He admits right before that he sucks at fighting with weapons.</br>  <br>Transform into a magical girl</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br>Magical Lyrical Moon Prism BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL ACTIVATE and make it double!<br>Now you can't get it out of your head.</br></br></br>  <br>Be an actually interesting and likeable character</br>  he cannot beat demonbane  <br>Onii-sama is the greatest.<br>He is made out of pure thoughts and righteous anger.<br><br>Now lets listen to some quality music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sEb<wbr>4yh1tObM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>In all fairness Mayumi was rather rude this entire volume and acting like everyone owed her something to help her out, I don't recall her thanking Miyuki or Ichijou for their help in the Nakura investigation. She was being too forward and pushy with Tatsuya and that clearly didn't sit well with him.</br>  <br>I have seen the light. Sasuga Onii-sama.</br>  Is the scene where Tatsuya admires Jumanji body the funniest scene?  <br>Will she shit bricks when she learns that he's Yotsuba?</br>  <br> translations for volume 16 <br>NANI?!?!</br></br>  <br>You're late, translations for both 15 &amp; 16 are available albeit not edited and checked.</br>  <br>Will her father shit bricks when he learns that Maya has a "son" when she was supposedly infertile after his sorry ass couldn't protect her in Dahan? <br><br>I think that Mikihiko, Honoka, and some others at 1st high will be the mist shocked. Erika already guessed they are Yotsuba, Masaki pretty much figured as much even though Tatsuya denied it, and Mayumi already thought he was a Yotsuba "extra" so probably not as surprised. The big surprise seems to be their engagement.</br></br></br>  <br>Tatsuya commenting on other guys is always hilarious, but nothing beats that Juumonji scene, even the manga kept it.</br>  Here is the Google Doc for volume 16 for those interested.<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9<wbr>Ij40wbH06gR2dBT3dmTFRVT2M/view</wbr></br></br>  <br>http://www.docdroid.net/file/downlo<wbr>ad/15irx/15.pdf<br><br>Unedited 15, there's a part that is missing near the end, I'll repost that part here.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>chapter 9 part 2 mahouka v15<br><br> Tatsuya headed to a hotel, smaller than CR hotel where First High students stayed, but inconspicuous. It was a hotel that was frequently used by Kuroba-ka for work purposes.<br> “Good afternoon, Tatsuya-niisan”<br> “Tatsuya-san, we have expecting you”<br> Fumiya and Ayako was waiting for him in the lobby.<br> “I’m sorry for asking you to come all the way here”<br> “No, the case was originally brought to us after all”<br> <br> “We can’t keep talking while standing up like this, Tatsuya-san, why don’t you sit?”<br> Ayako welcomed Tatsuya to the sofa. After Tatsuya was seated, Ayako sat at the opposite end of the table, while Fumiya brought in some drinks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was wondering if it was allowed to eat or drink here, before he noticed a 3H wiping another table. No, it was a business type ‘Humanoid Servant’, it was similar to the type found in the aircraft which was called “Servanoid”. Since Tatsuya determined that it was not a problem, he received the drink without refrain.<br> Ayako expanded sound barrier. There was no warning against unauthorized use of magic. Seemed like this hotel was not only at the level of Kuroba-ka’s work, like what he had been told, but also completely modified for the work of Kuroba--- no, Yotsuba.<br> “This will do, and. Tatsuya-san, here are the things that you’ve requested”<br> “The bike is the same model with the one that Tatsuya-san has been using. It is parked in the parking lot”<br> “The clothing is stab-proffed and also bulletproof, do you want to change into it?”<br> “Boots, gloves, and helmet, all of the combat requirements are fulfilled”<br> “how gracious….”<br> They put much more effort than he expected, Tatsuya was about to laugh. Of course, he didn’t actually laugh, since he knew what the 2 of them think about him seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you. I’ll use them well”<br> Hearing this response, Fumiya and Ayako showed a really happy smile.<br> “Then, we will guide you to your room”<br> Ayako put down her tea cup and rose. Fumiya stood and left the drink at the table, hence Tatsuya followed him.<br> The change clothes that were prepared was really fit into Tatsuya’s body that it felt creepy. Tatsuya wanted to ask, where did they get his measurement from, but in the end he decided that it’s best not to ask, so it stopped him from asking.<br> “How far have you narrowed it down to?”<br> Tatsuya asked about the hiding place of Zhou Gongjin.<br> Hayama had been sharing the information that he got on Monday to Kuroba-ka. Based on that information, Kurobas had been investigating around the hideouts of Zhou Gongjin this week.<br> “We are almost certain of this”<br> “I see, as expected of Kuroba. Then?”<br> At Tatsuya’s question, Fumiya showed a slight hesitation.<br> “That, it’s hard to believe, but….”<br> <br> “JSDF, Uji second supply base. There is almost no other place to shelter him in this area”<br> In place of Fumiya who couldn’t speak about this so lightly, Ayako answered him.<br> Tatsuya failed to say, ‘no way’.<br> “I see. It is indeed quite a hideouts”<br> After he wore an antiglare, Tatsuya move to take the communication console.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>* “Thank you. I’ll use them well”</br>  <br>Sweet. Been looking for that for a while.</br>  <br> “Fumiya”<br> “Yes-”<br> After being called with a hard appalling voice, Fumiya answered with a louder than necessary voice.<br> This voice was evidently showing that Tatsuya’s feeling had reached a critical level. Since Tatsuya was not able to have high level of strong emotions, the moment it reached a certain stage, he would show it as an non-emotional intention on the surface.<br> The treachery of national defense force, was way over his tolerable limit. Since the rebels was attacking Miyuki in Okinawa, he was especially intolerate against betrayer.<br> There was a phrase called ‘nukeba tamachiru mizu no ha. It was a representation to say that Japanese sword would shine coldly eerie when it was sharpened. Tatsuya who lost his feelings in anger, was reminiscenting on this phrase.<br> “Is it possible to do external communication?”<br> “Please wait for a second”<br> Fumiya outstretched his hand beside Tatsuya, and keyed in the security code in the keyboard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a doc or something so I can insert missing text?</br>  <br> Tatsuya was prompted by Fumiya, sat down in front of the console.<br> Tatsuya entered the complex code. He waited for about 5 seconds before a female officer appeared on the monitor.<br> “Tatsuya-kun, what’s wrong, suddenly?<br> Tatsuya entered the code for emergency calls that are assigned to Fujibayashi’s own line.<br> “Lieutenant, I’m in Kyoto now”<br> “I see…”<br> With only those words, Fujibayashi seemed to understand him.<br> “Did you find out?”<br> She intentionally omitting words in her question, Fujibayashi sighed in the midst of resignation.<br> “I have an idea of Zhou Gongjin’s hideouts”<br> Tatsuya did not share the information from the traditionalists at Kiyomizu Temple and Mt. Arashi to Hayama only, he also shared them to Fujibayashi. It was a serious crime for this country’s army to assist Zhou Gongjin who led the foreign troops in this land. Tatsuya could not afford to avert his eyes even if he’s asked to. Tatsuya was going to use that.<br> “Where is it?”<br> Fujibayashi showed a painful expression in response to Tatsuya’s straightforward question.<br> “The military police is scheduled to be dispatched. Special lieutenant Oogura must not intervere.”<br> “This is not subjected to the military rule of secrecy. Fujibayashi-san, where is Zhou Gongjin? You’re part of Kudou-ka who promised for cooperation, please answer me”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “… he’s inside the JSDF, Uji second supply base. Tatsuya-kun, leave the rest to the Armed Forces. Even if it is you, you won’t be left unexcused if you trespass on the base”<br> “I understood. See you”<br> “Tatsuya-kun!?”<br> Without clearly saying what he ‘understood’, Tatsuya cut off the communication. Additionally, he locked the line via the console.<br> He looked back, behind hime Fumiya and Ayako had seen his exchange with Fujibayashi with rounded eyes.<br> “Support is cut off. How about the plan?”<br> “Start at sunset, and we get into the base”<br> Fumiya who just regained his sense answered Tatsuya.<br> “How about the intrusion path?”<br> “We’ll enter proudly from multiple gate. It is not a big problem to overcome such a plain fence.”<br> “of course, we have to have someone to standby by the gate”<br> “We don’t have the number”<br> Tatsuya stood up while glaring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The background for that card makes it seem so. The other wedding cards cards have clean background like this one.</br>  <br> “Fumiya, Ayako, I will get someone to help us. I might not be able to enter the base on time, but I will do so if the time allows me to”<br> “understood. Tatsuya-niisan, the communication device will not be connected at that time”<br> “Tatsuya-san, becareful”<br> “Fumiya and Ayako, you too, don’t let your guard down”<br> “Yes”<br> “Of course”<br> After hearing their repies, Tatsuya proceeded to the bike that had been parked at the park lot.<br> He immediately recognized the bike. However, he rode the bike in the different direction than what was shown by the arrow.<br> The west sky had started to color red. Not much time until the start of the operation. Tatsuya called Masaki while riding the bike, he used the radio interface from information terminal that was charged in the helmet.<br> “Shiba? Do you have something?”<br> For masaki, a phone call from Tatsuya seemed to be a surprised. On the other hand, Tatsuya might show a similar reaction if he receive a phone call from Masaki. Since he knew that himself, Tatsuya did not say anything unnecessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh damn, I haven't been reading since like v12. Are the volumes before this translated too?</br>  <br> “Ichijou, I narrowed down Zhou Gongjin’s hiding place”<br> “Really!?”<br> “Yes, where are you now?”<br> “Nearby Kamigamo Shrine”<br> As Tatsuya thought, he came. Third High usually come in the day of the thesis competition itself, not a day before. However, Masaki should have come earlier for preliminary inspection when he considered last week’s situation.<br> “Let’s meet up at the southwest entrance of Uji Park at 1700”<br> “1700? Understood. I will be there”<br> Masaki probably thought that there was no more time. However he understood immediately the meaning of the specified time. Despite the unfriendliness of their communication, he still immediately took action.<br> He would be a formidable adversary, but a reliable ally. He understood well that Masaki was a good man, that was why Tatsuya preferred to contact him.<br> (I should hurry up myself)<br> It would be awkward if Masaki managed to get there on time while he’s late. Tatsuya increased the speed of the bike.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that's it from the part that was missing from the docdroid file.</br>  <br>Everything is now translated except the side stories.</br>  Don't mind me, just oniisama TL leader here. Shamelessly shilling for new members.  <br>You're reading too much into these cards. There's also a Miyuki and Masaki card that isn't just a Masaki card so take it however you want. There's also also a Lina one card and a Masaki alone card.</br>  <br>Is there a google doc for them?</br>  <br>For the side stories? No.</br>  <br>No the main volumes</br>  <br>Who all is working on the translations? Aren't there 2 people doing 16? <br><br>I'd be happy to apply to edit and fill in translations where needed as long as it's not through that fb group.</br></br></br>  <br>There is but it's not edited and anons here posted the cleanest versions available.</br>  <br>That's fine. just an email will do, or you can contact me on jcafe forums. I am Mknr_Rec and you can find me in the novel shoppu thread. What kind of skills and/or experience do you have?</br>  Is v13 translated too?  <br>Sometimes I forgot how broken Fiamma was</br>  <br> defeated by touma </br>  <br>Took 4 years of nip in college but it's been a while since, English teacher for middle school atm, got some time now before school starts. I'll check it out on jcafe.</br>  <br>Thread</br>  <br>Very nice. I'll send you the details after you PM me.<br>Do you have IRC?</br></br>  <br>Haven't used IRC in ages but it's not a problem. I'll contact you on jcafe.</br>  <br>Yes, and 14.</br>  <br>Would you be kind enough to post it?</br>  <br>Volume 14 is still on Baka Tsuki<br><br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Mahouka_Koukou_no_Re<wbr>ttousei:Volume_14_Chapter_1</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I meant 13 actually but still thanks.</br>  <br>huh what the hell?<br>Miyuki confirmed as non-related to Tatsuya?<br>I need to read about this more.</br></br></br>  <br> Today is February 25, 2096 CE, Tuesday. The day the second semester for the year <br>2096 ends.<br><br> Merry Christmas! <br><br> February 25 <br><br>You might want to check the raws.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>what is this crossover?<br>a manga or what?</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 16 does some crazy shit with the plot. there's a reason the community exploded on its release.</br>  <br>where can I read more about it, mate?<br>or you mean here? if that's the case I guess I can check the archive.<br>But I need an answer to the whole Miyuki not sister thing before I start checking the archive and get tired before finding a preper answer to my questions.</br></br></br>  <br>You can read V16 like anon posted here </br>  <br>There's this one. Don't have screenshots of the Lina one right now.</br>  <br>Can Shiki kill him?</br>  <br><br>If you're fine with spoilers then I'll just explain.<br><br>Miyuki is a genetically modified magician like Minami. Unlike Minami however, she had the divine luck of not having any genetic defects whatsoever despite heavy alterations. Though Miyuki's base material are the same as Tatsuya's, they have been changed to a point that they are genetically strangers.<br><br>Basically, they're siblings, but science has made them blood strangers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a work in progress. Though prior threads have translated the important explanation pages, they are not part of the Google Doc yet.</br>  <br>To summarize, she is his sister, same mother Miya and father Tatsurou. However, Miyuki was a test tube baby unlike Tatsuya and she was genetically modified to have a magic meant to be his limiter. Their aunt Maya says that she's a perfect masterpiece unlike Kudou's Minoru. Also that due to the extensive genetic alterations done to Miyuki, her and Tatsuya genetically are more like cousins so their children wouldn't have any defects. Of course, this is all coming from Maya so you can either believe her or not, some people are still questioning her motives because it seems too perfect, too soon. Time will tell.</br>  Tatsuya can do 2 things destroy all matter and rebuild all matter.  <br>can he kill himself?</br>  Why did this woman arouse Tatsuya-kun? She is just a horny bitch that is deceiving Tsugu-aniue.  <br>Unless the matter is already dead or has run out of psions. Or it happened more than 24 hours ago. There are limitations to his Regrowth.</br>  <br>Erika go and stay go, you ginger bimbo.</br>  <br>She reminds me of Maki the actress. She's supposed to be so beautiful but actually looked like shit. Somehow Mari turned him on yet a Mayumi in her underwear didn't. Miyuki and Minoru are both supposed to be otherwordly beautiful but they look about average. Erika is supposed to be less beautiful than Minoru. In conclusion, Satou has horrible shit taste or the illustrator isn't paying proper attention to the story.</br>  <br>You know, Tatsuya may just like tomboys.</br>  <br>Oh I read the summary on wikia<br>Firstly Tatsuya duels Kirito but when he is about to lose he uses his power to destroy the game world<br>In their second encounter he uses his incredible math ability to get out of their predicement.<br><br>In other words Kirito is a better player than Tatsuya, being on the upper level, while Tatsuya is a hack.<br>I think Kirito = Shirou and Tatsuya = a serious Gil, fighting in UBW sounds like a good simulation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hmm interesting But still it doesn't make it okay morally though.<br>Thanks based anons.</br></br></br>  <br>Gil(Tatsuya) is fated to lose in UBW(game world) but uses EA/Decompose to get the fuck out of it.</br>  <br>I think he likes mature girls and Mari is a more serious and responsible girl compared with Mayumi or any of the 1st year girls. Suzune too but she's almost too serious like Katsuto.</br>  <br>Miyuki is the most beautiful of the lot.</br>  <br>Masaki pls.</br>  <br>Are you saying she is not? Then should I wait for this blonde bimbo that Tatsuya told me is as beautiful as his sister?</br>  <br>Yeah there were 2 cards for the last week of the wedding event. The Masaki one with Miyuki already posted and a Miyuki one with Masaki, didn't bother to save them but if I come across it again I'll post it. The Lina and the rest are in the archives from the first week of the event.</br>  The imouto is always the best girl.  <br>Tatsuya is overall more powerful but Kirito is more skillful.<br>Kirito can beat him unless Tatsuya activates his God mode where he can destroy anything and everything.<br>Also give Tats enough time and he can catch up to Kirito's level easily as well.</br></br></br>  <br>See, even Tatsuya can appreciate that other beautiful girls exist.</br>  <br>He likes girls with toned bodies. Reminder that Mari is one of the only female with enough grip strength to stop him. He might have been aroused by Mayumi but it was not described, he still lost his shit and ran like a puppy, when Tatsuya gets aroused it disappears in an instant.</br>  <br>There is only one Masaki and Miyuki card, the other ones are Masaki and Lina.</br>  <br>Touma literally has a jobber aura built into his powerset. You cannot beat him as long as you are living your life one bit incorrectly.</br>  <br>Miyuki looks plain, many girls are prettier and hotter.</br>  <br><br>Tatsuya often finds himself admiring Miyuki and admits to himself in V16 that thinking of Miyuki that way is like dancing on Maya's palm.<br><br>Also the reason why Tatsuya was aroused by Mari is because of her perfume, if you her magic you should know that she manipulates the mental state with mixes of pheromones and scents.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirito wins by merit of his game stats and the Incarnate System. Tatsuya is actually the better fighter, but Kirito is much faster.</br>   Upon seeing that he had been unable to keep up with the elimination of his magic sequence, Tatsuya set his decomposition to target the dynamic structures causing the fluctuation in air density. <br> The interference potential trying to create areas of high air density and the interference potential trying to prevent high air density both struggled for supremacy. <br> As a result, Katsushige’s magic ended up misfiring. <br> “Wha—!?” <br> An astonished voice escaped Kanata’s throat. <br>The difference between Katsushige and the Tsutsumi siblings was that he did not end up backing down just because the magic he was good at had been blocked.<br> Katsushige, now completely a part of the battle, cast his next magic to attack Tatsuya. <br>However, the localized, violent updraft that suddenly arose prevented Katsushige from further attacking.<br> The violent gust that arose against Katsushige’s center of mass was the result of a magic that was invoked in the skies above him. <br> The wind being gusted up in a vortex right above Katsushige was being cooled by a sharp decrease in pressure as it condensed the moisture within it into fine particles. <br>The decrease in pressure was due to nitrogen, of which nearly 80% of air is made, simultaneously liquefying in large volumes.<br>It was Miyuki’s “Niflheim” at a high altitude where Katsushige’s interference potential could not reach.<br><br>Why is Miyuki such a shit, she cockblocks even interesting fights.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dance on, Big T. Dance on.</br>  <br>Admiring her because she's beautiful, not because he's interested. He was aroused by Mari, plain and simple, it's not because of a perfume, it's not even written that she was using it.</br>  So she goes around campus wearing that perfume. I wonder how many students happily accepted being taken to 'detention' by her.  <br>This is a drug and that's when she is fighting.</br>  <br> Kirito is similar to a cheater faggot <br>color me surprised.<br>well still it wouldn't be a fight if you don't give Kirito something to depend on.<br>Kirito is a good player but Onii-sama is like a super-genius God.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't.</br>  <br>Tatsuya states that only after he caught a wiff of her perfume did he notice such a change. Odds are that she wears pheromone perfume to snare men to do her bidding. Erika is wary of her for a reason.</br>  <br><br>“There’s no need to worry about genetic abnormalities of our future children either”<br>“Why, is that so?”<br><br>Miyuki who was facing down in a gloomy face, rose her face ang fixed her eyes at Tatsuya. The white skin above her neck was not covered by the hitoe had made Tatsuya involuntarily wanted to look away. However, thinking so would mean that he was walking in Maya’s palm, so he regained the calmness in his mind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And well SAO is more popular than Mahouka and you can't make Kirito look bad, right.</br>  <br>This is bullshit. Erika is a jealous brocon, that's all, Mari is not a bitch who would use pheromones on her body to ensnare men. Tatsuya got aroused by womanly smell, it happens IRL , she was not using a perfume.</br>  <br> womanly smell <br>Yeah about that, have you ever popped a boner from smelling roses anon?</br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with wanting to look away from your sister when she is clothed like that, it's not the first time it happens anyway and he reacted the same to other girls in a similar situation. He doesn't see her as a woman.</br>  <br> Thinks smell of a woman and roses are the same <br>I had forgotten I was on /a/.</br></br>  <br>No there are 2 cards from the 2nd week. The Lina solo and Masaki solo (with George) are from the 1st week.</br>  <br>Dude, it's her perfume he smelled, not her sweaty, musky cunt.</br>  <br>Lina solo and Masaki solo have them placed in the same room with the same furniture.</br>  <br>In the same SAO Crossover Tatsuya pretty much sees Miyuki naked and plops her on the bed after she passes out. When she tells him my body belongs to onii-sama he's like what in the world is she thinking, and leaves. He's not aroused by Miyuki, he can objectively think she's beautiful without any sexual stimulus. It's just like complementing someone.</br>  <br>Just seeing a naked body won't do it for Tatsuya, his other thoughts were overwhelmed by the danger to Miyuki's safety. In a given situation he will become extremely ill at ease and flustered.</br>  <br>It's not said that she was wearing perfume and you don't need to smell a woman's cunt to be aroused by smell. Morevoer, it's not only the smell but the combination of all this which aroused him.<br> With her head partially lowered with a pair of upturned, almond-shaped eyes, and in addition to that, a faint, sweet scent drifting toward him, Tatsuya became conscious of his own sexual excitement. <br>Basically, Mari is a semen demon.</br></br></br>  <br>With Tatsuya's hand in the picture of Lina's. The ones with Miyuki are in the same setting too with the sofa so it doesn't mean much. It's just a card game. I don't expect the LN will end with any pairings to be honest or a wedding, just an open end.</br>  <br>There was no danger, she passed out in the sauna and she was waking up in her room, safe and sound. You're really desperate to find Tatsuya being aroused by Miyuki when in truth he never sees her like that.</br>  <br>She had a heat stroke and there was an immediate need to have her cooled down. When he sees her later in his room he's more relieved that he's okay and befuddled that she's accusing him of something. As far as I can tell that was the one and only time Miyuki yelled at Tatsuya.</br>  <br>He can't lose.</br>  <br>Everyone has a smell, it's not uncommon to find your girlfriend's scent as arousing or like to sleep on their pillow because it smells like them.</br>  I read chapter 16 and it said miya was the one who made tatsuya to destroy the word for her sister? Was the translator on shrooms or some shit? <br><br>Had no idea that head was married a lowly guardian. The fuck is he thinking with all those semen demons available.</br></br>  <br>He was confused by her vast misunderstanding of the situation. She thought he took advantage of her and then said but I don't mind, take advantage of me any time, my body belongs to you. Tatsuya was like what in the world is this sister or mine thinking, silly girl. The idea never crossed his mind and he left before she could embarass herself any further.</br>  <br><br> Traditional Chuuni with a lifetime's experience for maximum stu <br><br>Pretty much</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did a bunch of people bail on you or something?</br></br>  <br>You mean Miya? Miya was rather frail and not in the best shape to have children, the clan found an easily manipulated man with a large psion pool that they could pay off and dispatch as soon as he fullfilled his duty. Miya was supposed to be the single one, not Maya but the Dahan incident changed things around.</br>  <br>He can't bypass accelerator's barrier.</br>  <br>Nah, just two TLs who have started school again. But not to worry, it's not an awful lot that remains to be TLd. We need editors and TLCs to finalize the project, we don't have any dedicated TLCs at all to be honest.</br>  <br>wtf, is this a doujin? The art looks like trash</br>  <br>Tatsurou was not easily manipulated at all, he was given no choice yet still kept his old crush as a mistress, alsp he may be a distant relative of the Yotsuba. More on that, it appears that descendants of the founding families Shiba and Shinonome were reintroduced into the family in the latest generation.</br>  <br><br>I meant this part<br><br> However, that was not Miya-san’s true feeling. Yet, we were not aware of that until the month of her delivery, less than a year later. <br> Miya-san’s real wish was to retaliate the world. The thing she wished for was for an owner of a power which could overturn the world. To destroy the world which hurt Maya-san, and the world which hurt Miya-san. <br><br><br>Actually now that I think about it the spoiler was that Maya wanted big t to blow up the world which is true. But it was Miya who wished for him to be that destructive correct?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maya says that the wish for a world destroyer was hers, but it was Miya's mental interference magic that made it possible. From the looks of it, Miya didn't want this to happen, but her sister's thoughts won out in the end, which is a large part why Maya considers Tatsuya her son.</br>  <br><br>How do you feel about that other guy posting his partial volume 16 translation. Did it perhaps, fluster you?</br></br>  <br>Not like they really cared about him having a mistress. From what I can tell, having a mistress is pretty common for the numbered families considering all the arranged marriages. It was hinted that Koichi's 2nd wife, Mayumi's mother, may have been his mistress too before she became his wife and Mayumi. That might explain the distance between Mayumi and her brothers. The only happy, intact families we know of are the Kitayamas and Ichijous.</br>  <br>Are you sure? I don't remember seeing those. This page http://lostzero.gamerch.com/ has the cards listed for each event and gaccha. At least it doesn't look like it's missing any, only the most recent gachhas.</br>  <br> Decomposes the barrier. <br>Accel's barrier is not multilayered.</br></br>  <br>No, I'm fine. We had expected something like this to happen, we knew that the FB group was gathering funds to pay for a translator. We still intend to finish our version, if the fates allow it.</br>  <br><br>Oh so people actually paid for it. Explains a lot. Do you see your group breaking up after this volume? <br><br>Well tbh I honestly expected you guys to dismantle early on but I'm impressed you got not one but 2 volumes nearly done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Accels barrier isn't something you can decompose though.</br>  <br>Gram Dispersion.<br>Why would his barrier be impossible to decompose?</br></br>  <br>Tatsuya decomposes concepts backing the world, actually the only thing he does.</br>  <br>And there are plenty of magics with vector shit and stuff. Mahouka magic is reality warping, Tatsuya even said that Masaki's Bias Release had no vectors originally. A good systematic magician would crush Accel. Vector reversing barriers are common stuff there.</br>  <br>Thanks for all your work. I hope you will continue for 17.</br>  <br>All members have contributed and without their efforts none of this would be possible, but the main TL has been an absolute champion of the group. She is the one called Y in the progress docs. I can't tell for sure what will happen. We do keep in touch and even the members who have gone back to college say that they will continue working with us when they can, albeit due to a busy schedule it'll be very slowly.<br>We had no plans for V17 in the first place, initially it was only V16, but on the insistence of several members we picked up V15 as well and played with the idea of doing the SS as well.</br></br>  Don't you guys get bored of this LN?  <br>Shoot actual bullets from his gun.</br>  <br>Actually for things like mental/magical constructs he's more likely to use dissolution. Dispersion is used to dismantle magic sequences mid-cast.</br>  <br><br>So you guys did it  for free? </br></br>  <br><br><br>Actually Maya was the one manipulating Miya MCA by using twin resonance to create Tatsuya - destroyer of worlds, more than destroying the world she also wishes someone powerful enough to make everyone in the planet miserable as she wishes full retribution, Tatsuya is also able to do it, last novel clearly states that Tatsuya is able to make the entire world his enemy and win against the whole lot of armies on it alone .</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, absolutely.</br>  <br>Gram Dispersion is Decompostion magic anon. The other is Gram Demolition.</br>  <br>She was not. Maya is just retarded.</br>  <br>That's decomposition for magic, Tatsuya decomposition is tailor made for targets he wish to decompose the magic sequence used to decompose cars is different from the one used to decompose human body and so with magic sequences.</br>  <br>Maya actually said it but her story also matches with Mitsugu story</br>  <br><br>I know about gram dispersion. However for things without a magic sequence Tatsuya uses dissolution to scatter the magical powers of the object. He uses dissolution to destroy shikigami spies among other things. It is such that Miyuki who specialises in spirit magic will instantly notice it if he uses dissolution.</br></br>   Read volume 16 to see ayako's crying section <br> That's exactly where the TL stopped <br><br>MOTHERFUCKER</br></br></br>  Pound the Mayumi pussy.  Miyuki is a goddess  <br> dissolution to scatter the magical powers of the object <br>Actually Tatsuya uses several different means to destroy magic scattering magic power is jus one of them destroying directly the concepts building the magic sequence is much more efficient but more showy, with gram disperssion he is able to create an wide area negating all magic by instantly decomposing any magic sequence before event change happens.</br></br>  <br>we are talking about onii-sama here<br>he is such an OP character that only someone like Gil or Arctype Earth could defeat him.</br></br>   some people seriously think Miyuki won't get the oniisamadick   <br><br>Fuck I hope ayako has a chance this shit is killing me inside miyuki is pig disgusting.</br></br>  <br>Maya is also insane and I'm inclined to question her version of the story until further confirmation. I don't even think Tatsuya bought it, I'm sure he'll be finding out more later or looking into it further.</br>  <br>Miyuki won't be getting anyone's dick. I find it funnier that people think the author is going to have any semblance of a romantic resolution in the story.</br>    <br>They fail to realize how eager Tatsuya is to make her happy. When he says that he can only see her as a sister for the moment, that's him worrying for her, not trying to escape responsibility.</br>  <br><br>This. Omniisama isn't getting in a relationship with anybody because that would make it slightly less acceptable for other females to fawn over him.</br></br>  <br>I don't recall it ever being his obligation to have fuck her either. Fuck =/ protect which is what he said he'd do, as well as never abandon her, in whatever way that may be considering his eye is on her even when they were in different cities.</br>  <br>Oh you can expect Miyuki to start marking her territory and driving off orbiter hoes in the coming volumes. Not that she'll need to since Tatsuya only has eyes for her, but she's going to shoot down cock thirsty females left and right. Starting with the Saegusas.</br>  <br>If the author plans on milking the series and perhaps making a sequel about their college years or adult life then there isn't going to be any major pairing ending for either Tatsuya or Miyuki. You can make more money dragging it out.</br>  <br><br>Well that shit went public so I doubt she will have to. IIRC, people were avoiding them back at school. Mayumi is probably disgusted. <br><br>Only thirsty motherfucker left is masaki who will try to petition the marriage.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Truly grateful for the effort you guys put into this. I honestly thought I would be waiting for 2019 to read it and that the fandom would slowly die off.</br></br>  <br>Mayumi sank her own ship in Kyoto via her own immaturity. Honoka and Lina still remain contenders. Tatsuya only seeing her as a sister remains a huge issue that you seem to ignore as if it's nothing. Tatsuya isn't someone that can just cast aside his own morals just like that.</br>  <br>Mayumi is distraught and I think the school is more concerned with them both being Yotsuba top dogs, specially Tatsuya who is publicly recognised as the son of magic Satan.<br>The teachers suspected that he was hiding his powers previously, now they have their confirmation and depending on how much more Maya is intending to let the public know they'll come to fear Tatsuya a lot more than they fear Maya.</br></br>  <br>You forgot that Lina is also coming back in V17 and it was already foreshadowed by Miyuki that she would be a great ally to Tatsuya.</br>  I feel like /a/ would have enjoyed this a lot more if they watched it as a comedy like some of us did.  <br>You mean Masaki's father because Masaki is too shy to get involved in drama without getting dragged into it.</br>  <br>Mayumi is still in the race, Kyoto was actually a step in the right direction for her. Had Tatsuya paid attention to her he'd be Tatsuya Saegusa now and not Tatsuya Yotsuba. Honoka seems to be going down the lesbian consolation route and Lina is getting shipped off with Masaki as Miyuki's replacement.</br>  <br>Masaki is such a beta faggot.</br>  <br>I think it's a combination of both them being engaged siblings and Yotsuba.</br>  <br>Them being siblings is probably the part they have the least issues with. After all they never acted like siblings and they have been publicly announced as cousins</br>  Would Touma be able to defeat Onii-sama  <br>He's not very good with people or being social but he's pretty good at fighting and killing people. I'll give him credit for being competent in battle and figuring out Zhou's MI magic. He worked well with Tatsuya and Tatsuya clearly thinks enough of his skills to trust him.</br>  <br>Ugh no, they were already slightly disgusted by their behaviors previously but it was more accepting because it was always denied and played off as a joke. Now the joke has become reality and they will be disgusted.</br>  <br>No, Tatsuya would break his neck and that would be the end of it.</br>  <br><br>He is but he's a good guy. I just hate masakifags really. Either way Tatsuya doesn't want to fuck his sister and masaki is probably Onii-sama approved.</br></br>  <br>I hate all xfags. I'm just in it for the public transport.</br>  <br><br>really? you wouldn't be pleased from seeing one pairing happen?</br></br>  O N I I - S A M A<br>N<br>I<br>I <br>-<br>S <br>A <br>M<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Masaki will die in the battlefield like a true magic CoD fag.  <br>People were in disbelief of them being siblings before. If they're taking distance now it's because they're big and scary Yotsuba main house members. The girls will fear Tatsuya because of Miyuki and the guys won't even try to compete for Miyuki because she only has eyes for Tatsuya who neither of them can come even close to.<br>Why do people not expect Miyuki to start setting up barriers now that Tatsuya is legally hers'? Before she would only send out occasional bursts of cold air, now she's going to send a fucking blizzard at you if you make eyes at Tatsuya.</br></br>  <br>They are all pretty one-sided and sort of happen for dumb or coerced reasoning instead of development. But I suppose if I had to pick one, I hope George gets to marry his loli.</br>  <br><br> maya just helped enable this behavior further <br><br>why<br><br>ON another note I wonder what maya would have done if tatsuya truly refused</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miyuki is a lady and she wouldn't act like psycho bitch or else Tatsuya would frown on it. You guys act like she's impolite to people.</br>  <br>He can't, that's why she had this plan cooked up in the first place. Tatsuya has no concept of happiness aside from Miyuki. He will do anything to make Miyuki happy as long as it does not end up hurting her.<br><br>Miyuki is actually quite the bully.</br></br></br>  <br>The only bully in the story is Erika and Maya.</br>  <br>Yeh now they look super edgy from normalfag point of view.</br>  <br>Miyuki is not a lady Maya rightfully says it in front of Tatsuya and hes the only one to deny, lats volume showing how much Miyuki is mentally ill.</br>  <br>How the fuck is Mayumi still in the race? What in the world can she do that she hasn't already tried? I think that asking a guy to dinner and then your hotel room and reminding them that they had promised to dig in before is about as much as she could have done. She's pulled out all the cards. She accepted defeat when she told him she'd forget about that night.</br>  <br>Maya never says that, stop making things up. Tatsuya is the one to call Maya insane.</br>  <br>Next vol is about magic clans battling about one drop of Tatsuya semen, last attempt to get Tatsuya will happen by political coercion.</br>  <br>Mizuki and Mikihiko are pretty normalfag. As is Shizuku and the rest of 1st high. Shizuku already warned Honoka about it.</br>  <br>How do you know</br>  <br>She is very much in the race when she makes Miyuki think that something did happen that night and then runs off with a huge grin on her face.<br><br>No what he said is true, Maya said that Miya raised Miyuki to be a perfect lady and to not pay Tatsuya any attention so that she would not one day unintentionally fire her MI magic at him in jealousy. She says that in that regard Miyuki is a failure, but perhaps there was no such thing as a perfect lady in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Suck ya dick.</br></br>  <br> Still thinking Mayumi can pull a clutch <br><br>/a/ pls<br>Mayumi is done.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is there anything he can't do? <br>use those silly serrations to cock the non-existent slide on his not-gun?</br></br>  <br>The Saegusa didn't object to anything, the rest of the clans seem more focused on undermining the Yotsuba power than worrying with Tatsuya. Ichijou father just seems concerned about marrying off his son. Mayumi already has two fiance candidates. Frankly she can't even wear the proper attire for hiking in the woods, I'll be surprised if she has any candidates left. People act like Mayumi's genes are the shit or something when nobody wants, Tatsuya didn't even give a fuck about being her bodyguard he dragged along someone else to worry about her ass. That's how much of a fuck he gives about Mayumi. He clearly states he only helped her because Nakura led to Zhou.</br>  <br>What are your predictions on ayako? Is she cooked?</br>  <br>Ayako has a purpose, what exactly I'm not sure but everything in this story has some kind of hint and purpose so her noticing Maya's intentions is going to play a part. So then I guess no, she's not done.</br>  <br>If either Honoka or Mayumi tried to jump on Tatsuya's dick I don't think he'd be able to hold them off.<br>Actually I sort of want Honoka to be Tatsuya's first, just so she can later die and take Tatsuya's virginity with her to the grave.</br></br>  <br>Vol. 17 is a decisive vol. For all Tatsuya x XXX.<br><br>So either they accept they can't win against Miyuki or Tatsuya has someone he likes or someone Tatsuya really cares about dies making Tatsuya promise never to love someone(Erika or anyone of his friends). It's pretty much decided.</br></br></br>  <br>What I mean is that Miyuki has never behaved unladylike because she knews Tatsuya likes maturity and girls to act like ladies. So she isn't going to throw a public hissyfit because that isn't going to jive well with Tatsuya. She acts how she acts to please him. Tatsuya doesn't act like a dick for the hell of it. <br><br>If Mayumi confesses, she's going to get the same answer as Honoka.</br></br></br>  <br>Good luck with that. Mr. Emotionless Robot for 16 volumes is suddenly going to love someone? Yeah not happening.</br>  <br>Well Miyuki's ladylike personality is shit bcuz Erika showed up.</br>  <br>Dude can't take a "what if" scenario?</br>  <br>Mayumi is a troll and I appreciate her efforts to at least rustle Miyuki's feathers but she has a few problems to deal with. Number one being her own father and the fact that she went behind his back to avenge her bodyguard.</br>  <br>Actually she does and Tatsuya reflexively denies it, he is clearly being emotional there unlike he is 99% of time.<br>"..Miyuki is a lady she only loses her control because the [Vow](sealing magic)", but leaking her feelings so easily is the real source of problem, I like Miyuki but she is far from lady she is little girl, Ayako by contrast is at least 10 times more refined and lady-like than her .</br></br>  <br>Not sure you can put Erika and "lady" in the same sentence. Erika is a total bro though.</br>  <br>be the MC of a nonshit show</br>  <br> The Saegusa didn't object to anything <br>Yet, the first and fastest to object was Ichijou Gouki probable to save face from his son, who lost in miserable way.</br></br>  <br>Lol bruh. Erika is a "lady" even though she doesn't show it her harem gets boner every now and then. Tatsuya(Satroll) likes to comment on this kind of scene often comparing Miyuki and Erika.</br>  <br>Well she is just more laidylike than Erika but you know Erika acts like a man most of time</br>  <br>Fuck his sister. He has yet to prove me wrong.</br>  <br> miyuki threatening to freeze the entire student assembly to death because some hapless soul happened to say that Mayumi was gunning for him <br> miyuki going full what the fuck did you say about my oniisama in vol 1 when Hattori tried to belittle him <br> Miyuki giving Shippou the deathglare in vol 12 when he called Tatsuya a weed <br> Miyuki bullying Honoka when Pixie blurted out her intentions to Tatsuya <br> "ladylike" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't really lose when you never did much to begin with, at least Honoka and Mayumi tried something. Masaki is moreso helped by everyone else around him, which begs into question that is he even that motivated. His father is just being a typical TMC parent finding someone to marry their kid off. There aren't that many choices for him. The Saegusa are traitors who conspired with Zhou and the Kudou did the same and also worked with Sakai, the guy they already didn't like. The Yotsuba while sinister and questionable at least aren't traitors. So I suppose I can understand his wanting to form some alliance via marriage. The Juumonji and Itsuwa have boys and we don't really know of anyone else that's a female TMC magician.</br>  <br>She is more like a little kid and the author seems to be purposely portraying her as such, as she battles with her 12 years old alter ego herself and loses the argumentation.</br>  <br>That's actually pretty brilliant anon, never saw it until you so eloquently reminded me of her monologue to her mirror self.</br>  <br>Nah, more like Tatsuya would humiliate him, add him to his list of fawning groupies, and then use his incredibly convenient anti-magic powers to break the Yotsuba clan's hold over him.</br>  <br>The Yotsuba don't have a hold on him any more, it's Miyuki that does because if she ever dies so does everyone else.</br>  <br>I understand that Tatsuya has nerfed emotions and can't love anyone else, byt why the hell can't Miyuki. Is she stuck in 1st grade and all the other boys have the cooties? It's pretty illogical considering she didn't even like Tatsuya until later in life. There's no damn good reason for me as a reader to give a fuck that hurr durr can't imagine anyone but Tatsuya. That's pretty contrived and stupid. Arranged marriages happen, not like Mayumi wants to marry the gorilla but she isn't acting like a big drama queen about it. No, seriously why should I give a crap about what Miyuki wants or doesn't want in the zero. The author has given her zero personality and development outside of being a worshipping doll plot device.</br>  <br>Tatsuya is more or less unlike to think objectively about Miyuki and Myuki loses the ability to think while she is near Tatsuya, sometimes it feels like she reverts to her 12 years old self while she is near Tatsuya, sometimes she does intentionally as clearly stated in early novels, maybe she wishes to roleplay the little sister forever.</br>  <br>Tatsuya can tell that she's immature and needs to grow up though, he can make determinations about her that aren't biased. He acts in her best interest. Miyuki is an eternal child who is going to have to grow up. Not sure who to blame here for how she turned out, the Yotsuba, her father or to an extent Tatsuya himself.</br>  <br>Sometimes it gives me the impression that Miyuki is just fitting in as Tatsuya treats her like 6 years old kid, previous volume made it even clearer</br>  <br> Next time we're alone, lets fuck <br> is alone with her <br> doesn't fuck <br>onii-sama is a faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayumi needs a better man, see </br>  <br><br>look at the camera and urge the viewers to apologize for Japanese war crimes.</br></br>  <br>No one got this reference. I am sad now.</br>  <br>Lel</br>  when is the next volume out  <br>Next month I think</br>  <br>August 8.</br>  <br><br><br>Very nice. Probably the most anticipated chapter right?</br></br></br>  <br>It's game of clans + Lina, I'd say so.</br>  <br>Cover page should be out on today or tomorrow.</br>  <br><br>Well I thought everyone was waiting for the reactions from tatsuya being a Yotsuba since the blooms gave him a hard time</br></br>  <br>Sort of past that at this point, people sort of suspected already. The Bloom Weed thing stopped being relevant after the first couple of volumes.</br>  <br>This early? Preview chapter a week before?</br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br>Tatsuya, Miyuki and Lina on the cover? Clan heads?</br>  <br><br>Yea but that shippou faggot and morisaki and hattori's reactions should be sweet nontheless.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Maya  and Ayako </br>  <br> ayako will never know the pleasure of being cummed inside by onii-sama <br><br>fucking mercy kill her author</br></br></br>  <br>Shippou is going to get promoted to 10 MC and the guy's ego will keep imploding. Obviously there's a huge need for their paper magic and weather predictions.</br>  <br> Obviously there's a huge need for their paper magic and weather predictions. <br><br>Miyuki's paper clean up was more complicated what a fucking embarrassment holy shit why is he even a bloom</br></br></br>  <br>Kasumi will be his waifu, that's Koichi's next plan in efforts to save his own treasonous ass.</br>   Ayako  a qt.  <br>Best picture of her is from volume 16 where it shows all the branch kids. She really makes Miyuki look average.</br>  <br><br> Weak in combat <br> Goes around threatening established older women <br><br>This always bothered me. Then she gets subtlety nervous around Tatsuya.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get it</br>  <br>Be in a show that's anything but shit.</br>  I don't want any part of this shit series if Miyuki gets with Masaki. Fucking lame shit. Fuck the author for being a special snowflake.  <br>Shitpost on /a/</br>  Make his series interesting for someone that isn't a teenager  Is tatsuya ever going to use baryon lance? He had the perfect opportunity with shibata and his guardian waifu. <br><br>Surprised Maya just let that fucking slide dude is one of the best combat magicians the yotsubas fucking have. It's like Tatsuya marrying minami of all fucking people.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Lina, Erika, Miyuki and Tatsuya<br><br> fuck everyone else.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yea that was weird.<br><br> Guardians are looked down upon <br> Maya announces a marriage between a head and a fucking guardian and everyone claps and says it's about time <br><br>The fuck?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try again.</br>  <br>Tatsuya can read your behavior down to atomic level and she actually cares about him.</br>  <br> &gt;Maya announces a marriage between a head and a fucking guardian and everyone claps and says it's about time <br>Where?are you reading the same novel?Yotsuba people gets either shocked or goes mental breakdown.</br></br>  So do you guys think that Airi would be canonized and challenge Miyuki?  <br>He can't save anime.</br>  Can he save /v/ and overcome gamergate?  <br><br>Well it wasn't that bad<br><br> With that introduction, Maya first turned her eyes to Katsushige. Beside Katsushige, who was donning a haorihakama just like Tatsuya and the others, uncomfortably sat Kotona who was donning a furisode just like Miyuki and the others. <br> “Katsushige-san, eldest son of the Shibata family, and Kotona Tsutsumi have recently gotten engaged.” <br> Huge cheers roared. Tatsuya tried to pick for some whispers from the crowds. There were more people who said “as I’ve thought” or “finally” than people who said “really?” <br> “From here on, it probably won’t be just happy times, there will be a lot of struggle as well, but please wish the young couple for bountiful blessings ahead.” <br> An ovation breaks out from the assembly. However, Tatsuya was not able to ignore how before that there were a lot of people who nodded in agreement when Maya said “a lots of things you would struggle about. <br><br>Then again we only have Tatsuya's outlook and given that he's a combat monster, might get more hate than the usual guardians.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What goes on inside the Miyuki van?  <br>Sasuga Onii-sama.</br>  <br>Otakus and closet otakus talk about anime and idols</br>  <br>he clearly says after the demonstration of baryon lance that decomposition magic would have been more than enough to make short work of shibata&amp;gardians <br><br>it's katsushige's condition for peacefully leaving the successor right to miyuki. Maya simply doesn't care as long as she reaches her goal to make miyuki the successor</br></br></br>  <br>Not the same, Maya true intention may not be seem by her apparent acceptance, she confirmed two things clearly, how much Kashige wishes to marry Kotona and about her health, she says that 2nd generation of mogicians magicians(Souta and Kotona) still share unstable DNA unlike Minami which belongs to the already stable Sakurai series and she is likely to suffer sudden death, implying that she will be wife for short time span.</br>  Will tatsuya get any marriage requests? It's miyuki this and that when tatsuya is pretty much the most valuable asset the Yotsuba have.<br><br>Since his magic is just artificially produced by Miya's MI and not BS, his natural abilities are probably top notch and up to Yotsuba standards if he has kids and he's useful as fuck.</br></br>  <br> katsushige's condition <br>Kotona will die very soon.</br></br>  <br><br> Maya trying to negotiate her as mistress <br> Ayako listening with a poker face <br> Fumiya blushing furiously  <br><br>Would have been a lot easier if Yotsuba just assigned a male guardian to male and females to females no exceptions.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and why? he's more indebted to maya than greeks to eu, there's no need to create discord among the branch families just for a petty guardian</br>  <br>Maya<br> caring about powerlevel of future branch yotsuba generations <br> wanting to destroy the world <br>you can only pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What about<br><br> wanting to watch her dear sister's kids fucking like rabbits and falling into her elaborate scheme </br></br></br></br>  <br>sure, but that would only be a consolation prize for her</br>  Maya should win Big T's D.  Why is Mikihiko not pounding this semen demon yet?  <br><br>What a hot piece of ass<br><br>Too bad she's wasted on someone like Mikihiko who can't handle that bod</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Guys like him are why NTR exists. She needs a good dozen men to make her feel like a woman.<br><br>Doujin when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's true though, she has been dead for to long.</br>   Beat Jesus Yamato 1v1.   <br><br><br>Airi is the only child of the Isshiki family, so that makes her a defacto heir. Also it's her father that is foreign, she was apparently a lonely rich kid so her bitch attitude is partially due to that. I'm not sure that she likes Masaki or she gave up on him because he's just disinterested in any girl that tries talking to him, she was quite taken aback that he liked Miyuki.</br></br></br>  <br>I would love to see who would win, GER - a being who can revert shit back to the state of 0, and reverse cause and effect or Tatsuya that can make impossible into possible. Two broken fighters</br>    <br>She looks so generic compared to Lina or Mayumi. Even Honoka is cuter in the Red Riding Hood event.</br>  <br>Posting superior girl.</br>  <br>Miyuki can kiss my ass, she's shit.</br>    Sadly the event had a victim.  <br>Why would a guy from 3rd High attack her?</br>  <br>It looks more like Juumongus borrowed a 3rd high uniform.</br>  <br>No worries, hunter onii-sama will save her.</br>  <br>Forgot the picture.</br>  Get his emotions back  <br><br><br>More like the magic little red hood town sent hired a hunter to end the threat after one of them fell prey.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking half breed cunt. That was for your sick grandma</br>  <br>I remember they put a version of the red hood tale with Tatsuya and Miyuki in the description of the event.</br>   Leo won't fuck minami so the ultimate tank can exist   <br>I opened the thread to post this. Good job.</br>  <br> 386 reply <br> no madara post <br>i'm disappointed /a/</br></br></br>  <br> Implying she won't be someone's mistress. </br>  Volume 17 cover guys!  <br>She can be my mistress anytime.</br>  <br>Bait?

Sure, that is your oppinion</br></br>  <br>*other girls *are</br>  <br><br>Why did you guys give explains way too round about , In short : Tat and Miyuki are popped out from the same hole ( Miya..kek) and have same dad ( Tatsurou's sperm) but Miyuki's gene is modified . they are technically sibling .</br></br>  <br>nope. we might her her name randomly pop up in one of the second 9sc side stories though</br>  <br>And then proceeded to sink her own ship in volume 15. Up until that time I agree with what you said but she's done now, she acted in a manner that was completely off putting to Tatsuya.</br>  <br>If author wants to sunk her hip, he would let her confessed - got rejected like what he did to Honoka ship ages ago. Not make her teased Miyuki at that station and walk away like she gets the upper hand</br>  <br> Minami  <br>Minami is already stable previous Sakurai series magicians weren't</br></br>  <br>She was basically rejected by Tatsuya, he ran off and put her to bed. She can tease Miyuki all she wants, doesn't change the fact that she made a bad impression on Tatsuya by being immature. She acted like a brat the entire time, not just to Tatsuya but in front of Miyuki and Ichijou. She pulled Tatsuya to the side to cross-examine and yell at him, it was pretty odd and obvious. Then she was huffing and puffing not able to keep up but denied it when it would have made it better had she just admitted she needed the help. She was pretty pathetic fighting too, barely scratching the magicians and waiting for everyone else to deal with the situation.</br>  But why is the Miyuki so perfect, /a/?  <br>that's how I watched it. Spent the whole show waiting for chink holocaust and it delivered</br>  <br>She's utter generic shit.</br>  <br>Be real</br>  <br> She was basically rejected by Tatsuya, he ran off and put her to bed <br>And that was rejeted ? , put [namely girl] into your scene and he will treat same like that. If author lets Tatsuya have sex with her, dont you think it will be end- game ?<br> ........... <br>And the rest of your comment is purely complain of a reader who doesn't like a certain character or her personality. A personality which make other readers find her character interesting. It is not affect the slightest her ship or her chance of winning. <br>I'm fine with your opinion, because it's only Your opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he cant beat TouMan</br>  <br>It's not my opinion, it's Tatsuya's, he was very much annoyed by her actions:<br><br>"Yes, I reserved seats at the front desk just now, since he told me there were free seats. It's a french cuisine."<br><br>Apparently, she had decided that he would escort her. <br><br>He had to be careful not to show a sullen expression.<br><br>***<br>Last night, Tatsuya had received an unreasonable request from a young lady(Mayumi) to strip her from her dress. He stripped her quickly before it becametroublesome, and shove her toher bed with just her underwear. He went out ofthe room without a second glance to her.<br><br><br>And I can keep posting annoyed or what a pain to deal with her acting like an infant reactions from him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who has the biggest tits in mahoukaverse?  <br> And I can keep posting annoyed or what a pain to deal with her acting like an infant reactions from him. <br><br>yes, let's post it, i will be amusing. maybe because i watched too much love drama, i don't expect a relatiopship go in a straightway without hudles to overcome. Because the straighest way relationship in this novel is Miyuki and her meme-love for Tat which makes me got sick. everything always goes in her favor</br></br></br>  <br>Jumonji, no contest.</br>  <br>Not saying that Miyuki's love is even better, it's worse but I just don't see Mayumi being in the game after 15. I would have cheered her on prior to 15 but her actions weren't the best and they annoyed Tatsuya, perhaps she can redeem herself. Miyuki has always been shit since day 1, her "love" is nothing but psychotic expression and frankly doesn't deserve anyone flaunting over her. <br><br>I'm not really sure that I have a preference for who wins Tatsuya at this point, or if I really see him with anyone but I can certainly agree with your points about Miyuki.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ayako. Honoka looked down on him with the other blooms and only likes him for his feats. Same as miyuki when she was a kid. Mayumi too likes his impressive acomplishments.</br></br>   Someone says something bad about Mayumi and her relationship with tatsuya <br> "B-b-but miyuki!!!" <br>Always. You cant defend the whore and her ship so you gotta attack the pure maiden that is Miyuki.</br></br>  <br>Properly handle a pistol by the looks of it</br>  <br>Miyuki is a selfish, psychotic test tube experiment. She's so shit even Ichijou is entirely too nice for her obsessive, stuck in a 10-years old mindset self.</br>  <br> pure maiden that is Miyuki. <br>Masaki pls.</br></br>  <br>She loves him for literally giving her a second life. She would have been dead if he did not use his magic.<br><br><br>Literally no chance like Iroha in Oregairu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Many of us did, shitposting and meme threads were the best part of this show.</br>  <br> the pure maiden that is Miyuki </br>  <br><br>Be a well-written character.</br></br>    <br>I read that in Jim Sterlings spitting voice.</br>  <br>Doesn't give her a right to loving him obsessively and selfishly. In fact, she should be giving him more credit and freedom, but she chains him and guilt trips him along with Maya.</br>  <br>The Miyuki does nothing of the sort. It is Onii-sama's love for her that ties him to her. They are not connected by chains of oppression but by the red string of fate.</br>  It looks like the dark times are coming......<br>We might not get fan translations for volume 12.<br>What to do, /a/?</br></br>  <br>Destroy Yen Press.

I believe the crunchy subs for Zenkoku used dead wall draw.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most mangaka don't give a fuck or two when their work goes overseas. In fact, when I went to Singapore, it had a slew of chinese translated titles that are not licensed yet in the west, Saki included.</br>  Reminder that YP is managed by Daiz's subordinates in order to crackdown LN translators and kill BT  <br>First Toki and now he plans to assassinate Saki? <br>Daiz has gone too far this time.</br></br>  <br>This is actually a good question.<br>And the answer might really be <br><br>Or perhaps Ritz will surprise us by going "i never said they had to play each other in order to meet"</br></br></br></br>  <br> In fact, when I went to Singapore, it had a slew of chinese translated titles that are not licensed yet in the west, Saki included. <br>This doesn't prove that "Most mangaka don't give a fuck or two when their work goes overseas." is true though.</br></br>  <br>Teru will run into saki either at the end of the Semis or at the start of the finals. Probably the finals.<br>Teru will ignore her or make some deep comment about how she hasn't yet bloomed.</br></br>  <br>Do the mangaka get royalties when publishers sell the licenses overseas?<br><br><br>Fuck her , I hope Saki forgets about that bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuck her , I hope Saki forgets about that bitch. <br>Think about it anon. If Teru is the one who alienated Saki, Saki must have done something to cause that. <br>Teru did nothing wrong.</br></br></br>  I would buy it if it were a physicial realese, but I won't buy a digital release  Let's go to the beach, anons!  <br>Saki will flirt with Kyoutaro in front of Teru and make her jealous.</br>  <br>OK</br>  <br>The beach is for losers, anon. Do you want to be a loser?</br>  <br>What if you're already a loser, like Kyoutarou?</br>  <br> Do the mangaka get royalties when publishers sell the licenses overseas? <br>Depends on the publisher but I think they do</br></br>  <br>Then the beach is off-limits for you anyway. Someone has to go grocery shopping in the meantime after all.</br>  <br><br>Saki knows Teru. Teru loves Cake. Saki wanders into the market with the best Cake.<br><br>Teru saves Saki from being run over by bus.<br><br>Sisters back together.<br><br>Or slight chance, Teru realizes Saki is still off her game at the semi-finals gives her a pep talk because she wants Awai to play the best. Or because she doesn't want to play Satoha again since it won't be a challenge.<br><br><br><br><br>I could live with "Rinshan Kaihou, a draw off the dead wall" in some instances.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Or because she doesn't want to play Satoha again since it won't be a challenge. <br>Teru doesn't really act like that. Remember in Achiga she comments on how tough it was to play against the others in the Vanguard.</br></br>  I hope they use http://osamuko.com/unified-mahjong-<wbr>terminology/ for translating the yaku</wbr>  <br><br>She also commented after clearing her provincial qualifier that she didn't get a chance to warm up because they were so weak. <br><br>So Teru wants good players. She may have played Himematsu before, and has played Satoha in the individuals. So she may have opinions about them.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I can hardly see your ruined bangs.</br></br>  So if Ritz censors a naked loli with a naked loli, what will Yen Press censor the naked loli with?  <br><br>Steam. It's conveniently situated.</br></br>  <br> I think it would be a good thing to show that the West is interested in Saki. <br>For what purpose?<br>What good can come of this?</br></br></br>  <br>The Age of Tanoshii</br>  <br> The Age of Tanoshii </br>  <br>they will also remove the noodles, just like in the anime.<br><br><br>Every team was first at some time during the quarterfinal captain match.<br><br><br>nice, I hope they use it  except the last column, that is BS. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Guys, What if Scam Anon is in charge of the Yen Press Translation / Localization?  <br>Neo-T/a/noshii no longer remembers Scam Saki</br>  Saki gets localized, which begins the west's acceptance of riichi mahjong. Within the decade it becomes a popular game. By 2050, it's played by girls all around the world, and war is forgotten. <br><br>This is the first step to the events of Saki becoming real. This is only a good thing.</br></br>   Buying anything digital only <br> Buying western translated shit (more middleman and less for Ritz) <br><br>Why? Just buy the japanese volume.<br>But don't buy the anime BD, because fuck Gokumi for releasing the BDBox with that Teru nendo, I will never buy that shit twice you fucking gook jew.</br></br></br></br>  Why slav characters are always the best in anime?  Personally I put Green and Black above her in terms of looks.  <br>The eyebrows remind me of a dragon(?) girl but I can't remember who.</br>  They just are.  <br>Because japs have no fucking idea how terrible most slavs are IRL.</br>        <br>In before Charlotte is slav too.</br>  <br>Wait where does it say she's a Slav?</br>    <br>my dick have confirmed it</br>   Anime Slav usually portrayed as having light colored / white hair. <br> Many of the real life Slav actually have dark hair. </br>  <br>Panty Terrorist is much better than her.</br>  <br>To be fair, we have no idea how fucking terrible japs are IRL too.<br>It's all idealization.<br>But here's one nasty slav.<br><br><br>It's the old "Snowy country? White hair" thing.

It makes women feel more safe and not subject of abuse  <br>It's a Chinese scanlate, don't you see?</br>  <br> no one knows how babbies are formed <br> good </br></br>  <br><br>For example, just 10 years ago in America, the best comedians could still make racial jokes, be they about Jews, blacks, Hispanics or whatnot. Now, racial humor is considered not PC and is no longer welcome on college campuses. Watch any Eddie Murphy movie from the 80s or 90s, or any Richard Pryor comedy routine. These are now considered "offensive," and therefore unfit for public consumption. No joke.<br><br>Just 10 years ago, men who thought they were women and dressed up in women's clothes were shunned by society and joked about even in polite conversation. These days, these people receive their penis-removal surgery with public tax dollars, and are featured on the covers of prominent women's magazines, referred to with female pronouns, and commended by the President for their "bravery."<br><br>Likewise, some 30 years ago, gay people were tied up to flagpoles and beaten until they were straight. They were the brunt of the best jokes and definitely considered dangerous perverts who molested children and carried HIV. These days, if you donate to a Christian charity that believes gayness can be cured through prayer, you will lose your job. The White House is decorated in the degenerate colors of the gay flag.<br><br>The thought police are stronger now than they have been since McCarthyism, except instead of promoting patriotism, they are promoting degeneracy, drug use and miscegenation. The masses haven't seem to have noticed anything has changed, though. Rachel Dolezal and Bruce Jenner are talked about on TV shows as if they might seriously be able to change their genes if they "feel black" or if they "feel womanish." <br><br>It is entirely possible that the regressive element in our society, in Orwellian fashion referred to as "progressive," could totally ruin our country to a similar extent envisioned in Shimoneta. In America, talking about sex wouldn't be taboo, but certainly any criticism of progressive-approved notions on gender, sexuality and race would be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of which... Any VNfag care to elaborate how is actually baby formed in this society? In Vitro under full anesthesia?<br><br>But where does sperm come from and are doctors performing it not in violation of the laws?</br></br></br>  <br>I've remembered how bad I was bullied for liking anime. Just 15 years ago.</br>  <br>Stop with this bullshit, women are still treated like trash, look at this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zNO<wbr>TWjIJ58E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Man attacks woman. Out of 24 people, only 4 help.<br><br>Nobody gives a shit about women's rights</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In America, talking about sex wouldn't be taboo, but certainly any criticism of progressive-approved notions on gender, sexuality and race would be <br><br>Yea, in America, that's the point. Nobody in Europe gives a shit about stuff like that, stop pretending that America is the world</br></br></br>  <br>That's common human psychology at work, anon. If it were a man, the same number of people would help because, as bystanders in a situation like that most would assume someone else is going to do something or hope that things work out by themselves when the proper authority arrives. Not every individual feels that they should step in, even when if they believe it to be the right thing to do.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bysta<wbr>nder_effect</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I will ignore the fact that I didn't even mention the treatment of women in my post at all and just say that even if I had, that would be a pretty bad example of how women are supposedly treated badly. With modern civil lawsuits, you can get sued for seemingly just about anything. The public has been cowed into staying out of other people's business, regardless of if it's "the right thing" to do or not.</br>  <br>You weren't bullied for liking anime, but because you were an ugly sperg.<br><br>We had two huge weaboos in class - one was on the basketball team and chill and the other wore naruto tshirts and never shut the fuck up. Only one of them was bullied, nobody gave a fuck about the other one being a weeaboo.</br></br></br>  <br>So it's actually getting better? Are you underage or do you really think that the world in the past was more "free"?</br>  <br>You Europeans have some pretty fucked up notions of white guilt. Google "Rotterham rapes." An entire police force looked the other way as Middle-eastern rape gangs raped some 1400 Aryan lolis because if they took down the rape gang gingpins, they were afraid of being accused of being racists (since there were no whites doing the raping).</br>  <br> Man attacks woman. Out of 24 people, only 4 help. <br>I wonder, how many would help if a woman attacked a man? Or a man attacked a man? Or a woman attacked a woman? My guess 0/24, 2/24 and 4/24.</br></br>  <br>Let's see. HIV is only a recent development of the sexual promiscuity revolution. Due to people not knowing how to copulate in a way that produces babies anymore, the white birthrate is plummeting in every Western nation to the point where it is becoming national policy to bring immigrants in by the boatload just to keep the economy afloat. Our countries are becoming browner and browner, and politics are shifting to favor the low class, easier-to-manipulate outsiders, instead of protecting national interests. Brown people are promoted and hired based on meeting racial quotas instead of by merit, and women are given special treatment under the auspices of gender equality and are often promoted undeservedly with a nod to the gender pay gap myth. Yeah, shit's pretty fucking bad right now.</br>  <br>I remember watching Eddie Murphy movies on over-the-air TV channels as a kid. Those were the days.</br>  <br> the white birthrate is plummeting in every Western nation to the point where it is becoming national policy to bring immigrants in by the boatload just to keep the economy afloat. <br>It has been happening since 1970s. <br> favor the low class, easier-to-manipulate outsiders, instead of protecting national interests <br>Again, nothing particularly new. <br><br> Yeah, shit's pretty fucking bad right now <br>I was talking about censorship, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It has been happening since 1970s. <br>Right around when the sexual promiscuity revolution really took off. Hmm...<br> Again, nothing particularly new.  <br>See: . And yes, it is relatively new.<br> I was talking about censorship, though. <br>Is English even your first language? How was that post supposed to be about censorship?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can we read the raw somewhere?</br>  <br>Where are our panty wearing terrorists?</br>  <br> Right around when the sexual promiscuity revolution really took off. Hmm... <br>No, it's closely related to decolonization and the economic crisis of 1973. <br><br> Is English even your first language? How was that post supposed to be about censorship? <br> So it's actually getting better? Are you underage or do you really think that the world in the past was more "free"? <br>I was talking about censorship. It's not worse today than in 1970s or 1980s.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this, I would love to translate this shit some time, but I'd need RAWs for that.</br>  That's rich.

Also I really find it amusing that you see 4chan talk about what's degenerate or not as weird, but you don't see it as weird that most of the degeneracy here is posted by virgins who haven't engaged in normal sexual relation, let alone fetishes and kinky shit.</br></br>  <br>But... That was my point.</br>  <br>  yet so smart at the same time. </br>  I want /pol/ to leave.  <br>Welcome to every single thread until the show finishes airing. It's going to be hell</br>  <br>At least the show isn't promoting race-mixing.</br>  <br>Why are they even here outside of shitposting? I mean you would think that that chinese cartoons promotes everything they are against with "muh multiculturalism", "muh degeneracy", "muh aryan race" ect.</br>  <br>Japanese (aka, East Aryans) are model nationalists. They do not allow the mass importation of rapist Mexicans or Arabs into their country, they do not intermarry with other races, and they stamp out multiculturalism very effectively at every level of their society. If only Western countries could follow their lead.</br>  <br> East Aryans <br><br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA<br><br>JAPS ARE LITERALLY UGLY SHORT SUBHUMAN MONKEYS THAT STOLE OTHERS CULTURES<br><br>THERE IS NOTHING "ARYAN" ABOUT THEM</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are Aryan in spirit.</br>  <br>And yet apple products are incredibly popular there</br>  <br><br>Too bad that marrying a chinese man is acceptable to over 90% of the population and isn't seen as weird. Korea to lesser amount (iirc 65%), just because we make jokes about how much the elevens hate koreans doesn't make it true. So go back to /pol/ with your "muh multiculturalism" because what you know about the elevens is wrong.</br></br>  <br>The only site I know off the top of my head for raws is raw.senmanga. The site is kinda buggy and slow though.</br>  <br>Chinese and Japanese are the same race, dumbass. It's not anywhere close to the same level as marrying a black. It would be the same sort of thing as a Frenchman marrying a German.</br>  <br>I started reading the manga and stopped cause it was just too silly. Enjoy your shit.</br>  <br>Manga-zone.org has a working link for the first tank.</br>  <br>Heteroconger hassi<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_OM<wbr>Df7Q9n04</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I have seen similar "experiment" with man attacking woman and vice versa. The woman got helped quite frequently but dude getting his shit kicked got laughed at and woman beating him got cheered up by other women. People generaly thought "he did something bad, so he deserved the beating", while woman getting beaten was "obviously" abuse.<br><br>That said the statistic sample you are working with is too small to make any good assumptions anyway (same thing with that one I mentioned) .<br><br>It isn't even that special that when someone is trying to defend abused woman in fight like that (fight within a couple), he will get attacked by "victim". Because they are gonna start to defend their partner (even the shitty one). So good luck at court because they are gonna sue the shit out of you if you are gonna even touch the abuser.<br><br>But really, that video doesn't prove or show anything at all. Just a shitty viral video for tumblr shits to jump at.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Art: Yuzuki N Dash <br>boners.jpg</br></br>  <br>What part of this is smart?</br>  <br>I thought the point of this censor was to give an illusion of a naked body, not censoring an actual naked body.</br>  <br>Perhaps she isn't actually naked under that.</br>  <br>Well, that's usually what you do to bikini pictures to make the subject look naked, so you're not wrong.</br>  <br> unironically liking LNs <br>You've read other things aside from nutritional facts on cereal boxes right?</br></br>  WHO IS BLUE SNOW AND WHY SHE WEARS A MASK   No one translating the manga <br><br>Someone will pick them up after the anime right</br></br>  <br>This has no chance of going mainstream.</br>  <br>LEWDING THIS SCHOOL WITH NO SURVIVORS</br>  <br><br>IF I TAKE OFF HER PANTIES WOULD SHE DIE ?</br></br>  mfw i find out that Anna's VA is Hisui  <br> Japan in charge of memes </br>  <br>But the publishers of those magazines go unpunished? That would be easier to censor than every perv in the country.</br>   show about nudity and vulgarity in the country where they have folkloristic traditions about nudity and vulgarities still respected today, all meanwhile people in families see eachother naked all the fucking time <br>what the fuck</br>  <br>It's like child pornography. It's easier to find the buyers than it is to find the producers, since the number of people using the smut will always far outweigh the number of people actually using it.</br>  Chinese scans up chap 7:<br>http://bbs.mengniangtv.com/?s=%E6%B<wbr>2%A1%E6%9C%89%E9%BB%84%E6%AE%B5%E5%<wbr>AD%90%E7%9A%84%E6%97%A0%E8%81%8A%E4<wbr>%B8%96%E7%95%8C</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>You ever thought that the reason that racial jokes aren't use any more is because trends have changed?<br><br>For example, 80's music was all hyper, but now music today is all garage punk and grimdark.</br></br></br>  <br> Hisui <br>Fucking who?</br></br>  <br>What's the context of that image? Wasn't she supposed to be pure?</br>  <br>Only on the outside.</br>  <br>She is. So pure that she doesn't realize just how lewd she actually is.</br>  <br> pure person <br> ecchi show <br><br>cmon anon everyone knows whenever theres a pure person, they are secretly ultra lewd</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't help her because that woman deserved it. Think about it, if she knows her man like many claim then she should know the do's and don'ts and if you do a don't. Then she only has herself to blame.</br>  Anon-kun...  <br> you will never fug meido-chan and   him <br><br>Anyways, I like the "tsundere with ponytail and kansai accent", she was an original and refreshing character.</br></br></br>  <br>Some guy fucked her in the ass and didn't have the common courtesy to give her a reach-around.</br>  <br> That girl looks angry <br>She's not. She just had a stroke.</br></br>  I've never watched this, but that blonde person is definitly one of the most beatiful things put into animation.  Mashiro a shit.  The hell you mean my pre-order was cancelled?  <br>You should have lack of respect for Itami then. <br><br>His reason for saving all those people was because he wanted to go buy some porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Why in the fuck would America NOT be involved in this?</br>  <br>That is the most realistic reaction though. Do you remember how japanese react when two guys got beheaded by ISIS?</br>  <br>Busy with Middle East. Their attempt to get involved was fucked up by china and russia.</br>  <br><br>Mostly because Japan is saying No and they aren't going to invade another sovereign nation when China and Russia would join in if they did. All for control of the Gate and an entire world of untapped natural resources.<br><br>All Japan would have to do would be to blow up the Gate and the war would be pointless and over.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people get mad at me for wanting to fuck her? She's cute and sexy, there's nothing wrong with my desire.  <br>That has nothing to do with it.<br><br><br>Has more to do with the show's content and the girl's personality than being hypocrital. Biyoris aren't sexualized in the anime (much), but Kate dresses like a hooker. Biyoris are also "pure" so many people are against sexualizing them, it is fairly common in non-fanservice SoL shows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ is full of normies, that's why.</br>  <br>Because you guys always get mad when I show my love for Hotaru. Of course I watched the show. That's how I know Hotaru is a cute and made for breeding. I'm always lonely.</br>  <br>It's all right OP I want to fuck her too, she's just asking for it.</br>  <br>Because its summer.</br>  Possible spoilers for ch.71<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Also, the question about Erwin.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Grisha/Carlafags BTFO <br>They exist?</br></br>  <br>Erwin's true waifu.</br>  <br>Just because he met him that day it doesn't mean it was the first time they met. They could've know each other for years and ran into each other.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Anon, how can you not know this.</br>  Why is Erina so lewd?  <br>BRUH!</br>  <br>If the theme stays as bento, she'd lost to most of the contestants. <br>Even Megumi would have a chance against her because hospitality stuff.</br></br>  <br>Maybe he is an opposite of Ryou, does well at classes and tests but loses his mind when challlenged to a duel.</br>  <br>At that competition only 3 grand finalist that can top her.<br>Hayama with his +1stats because of Jun and prodigy with magical nose, Kurokiba because reason, and Souma because MC plot armor.<br>The other can't stand a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Giganigga would have been interesting only to then see Kurokiba go full mad dog and curb stomp him latter on.<br><br>though her loosing to Hisako would probably be also interesting considering her "rivalry" with Erina.<br><br>with Takumi some bullshit would happen and both would loose ... jobs jobbing and all of that. im kidding alicebros </br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
